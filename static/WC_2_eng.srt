00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't stand the heat...
I wish I could take off this fur skin...</font>

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're like you...
We Minks have low tolerance for heat.</font>

134
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's really hot.
I'm gonna become a mummy...</font>

135
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mummy...</font>

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mummy?</font>

137
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mummy! Nami-<i>san</i>, if I become a mummy,</font>

138
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd be a little more alive, right?</font>

139
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I don't care!</font>

140
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, may I see your panties?</font>

141
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no energy even to smack you.</font>

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, I'm so hungry and it's hot...</font>

143
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need nutrition...</font>

144
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're out of food and we couldn't fish
because it'd been stormy for days</font>

145
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and finally it's clear.</font>

146
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Catch some fish somehow
before the weather changes!</font>

147
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all gonna starve to death
before we get there!</font>

148
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Food...</font>

149
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wanna do so, but Nami...</font>

150
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The water is boiling because it's too hot!</font>

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

152
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There won't be any fish around then.</font>

153
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do?!</font>

154
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emergency food...</font>

155
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't look at me!</font>

156
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! You got a bite!</font>

157
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a fish! It's huge!</font>

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Pull it up, Luffy!
– Luffy-<i>san</i>, go...</font>

159
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can do it, Luffy!</font>

160
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Food...</font>

161
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Food!</font>

162
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it!</font>

163
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

164
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's very big!</font>

165
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's eat!</font>

166
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did it!</font>

167
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its color doesn't seem right.</font>

168
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it okay to eat?</font>

169
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying?!
There's no such thing as an inedible fish!</font>

170
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Wait a sec!
I'll go check real quick!</font>

171
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

172
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the encyclopedia of fish?!</font>

173
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji's bookshelf is full of nudity!</font>

174
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found it!</font>

175
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright.</font>

176
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, this is not it.</font>

177
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it is!</font>

178
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Watch out for its skin!
The skin of that fish is extremely poisonous!</font>

179
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! I found Sanji's note!</font>

180
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The skin tastes good!</font>

181
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Wait! I'll grill it for you!</font>

182
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, try it, Carrot.</font>

183
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The skin's so slimy...</font>

184
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

185
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Shall we eat too?
– Yes!</font>

186
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's delicious! It's so delicious, Nami!</font>

187
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Yes, it even makes me cry!
– I'm so happy to be alive! Grr!</font>

188
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so good!</font>

189
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just cooked it like it
said in Sanji-<i>kun</i>'s note.</font>

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, you need energy too, first.
Eat it.</font>

191
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's gonna... d-die!</font>

192
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's cold...</font>

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crying isn't gonna help!</font>

194
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here! To take care of Luffy,
you have to gain energy, Chopper!</font>

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, eat!</font>

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

197
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But even if I wanna treat him,
we're short of antidotal herbs!</font>

198
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yum!</font>

199
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta find an island, Nami!</font>

200
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're lacking herbs!</font>

201
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yum!</font>

202
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Food...</font>

203
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's not that easy to find an island...</font>

204
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-<i>kun</i>'s encyclopedia says
it's extremely poisonous</font>

205
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and kills you instantly if
you eat the skin, right?</font>

206
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

207
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yum!</font>

208
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he's still alive!
Doesn't that mean he has strong antibodies?</font>

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has one of the best vital powers
of all humankind!</font>

210
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he's in very bad shape!</font>

211
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yum!</font>

212
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, are you okay?</font>

213
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The river is... beautiful...</font>

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's seeing the River Styx!</font>

215
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're about to reach Mama's territory.</font>

216
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are some islands in the area
around Whole Cake Island.</font>

217
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd say Black Leg and the others
have passed through those islands</font>

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and reached Whole Cake Island by now.</font>

219
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lower your guard, guys...</font>

220
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stand guard!</font>

221
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was gonna stop by at the first island.
Let's get an antidote there.</font>

222
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

223
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? This time, it's snow?</font>

224
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's beautiful!</font>

225
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not snow! Are those clouds of sugar?!</font>

226
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.
And it's a cotton candy flurry that's falling.</font>

227
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Cotton candy?!</font>

228
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice! Nice!</font>

229
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sweet...</font>

230
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,140
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45"><font color="#000000">Territorial
Sea Slug</font></font></font>

231
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,140
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45">Territorial
Sea Slug</font></font>

232
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Who is it?</font>

233
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your transponder snail is 
receiving warning signals.</font>

234
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means we're 
in Big Mom's territory for sure.</font>

235
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cotton candy!</font>

236
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys! Hide or disguise yourselves!</font>

237
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So sweet!</font>

238
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you listening?!</font>

239
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see something, Pekoms!</font>

240
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a ship! A ship is coming towards us!</font>

241
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Are they here already?!</font>

242
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?!</font>

243
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– That's probably a tarte, one of our scout ships.
– What?!</font>

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– I can't see it clearly because of the fog.
– What should we do?</font>

245
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– I'll handle it somehow, so all of you, go hide!
– Got it!</font>

246
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Oh, no! Luffy is looking really sick!
– What?!</font>

247
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison must've spread
into his system even more!</font>

248
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dangerous! We gotta treat him ASAP!</font>

249
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't they have an antidote
on that scout ship?!</font>

250
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– I'll ask them for you! Hurry up and hide!
– Okay!</font>

251
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper-<i>san</i>, hurry up!</font>

252
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

253
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

254
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that a transponder snail?</font>

255
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's huge!</font>

256
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a number.</font>

257
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sixty-six?</font>

258
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Germa.
Is that the Straw Hats' ship?</font>

259
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Germa 66's ship!</font>

260
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa 66...
The organization led by Sanji-<i>kun</i>'s father...</font>

261
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here, Straw Hats?!</font>

262
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna collide!
Guys, furl the sail!</font>

263
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, I'll be back.</font>

264
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We managed to avoid the crash...</font>

265
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

266
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

267
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that twirly eyebrow! It's Sanji-<i>san<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

268
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Sanji? Is that Sanji?!</font>

269
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

270
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-<i>kun<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

271
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!
I didn't expect to see you this soon!</font>

272
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How lucky we are...</font>

273
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji! We have a problem!
Luffy got poisoned by eating fish and is dying!</font>

274
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there any antidote on that ship?!</font>

275
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

276
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop calling me "Sanji"!</font>

277
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got the wrong person!</font>

278
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, of course I look like him.</font>

279
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Yonji!</font>

280
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,490
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="55"><font color="#000000">Vinsmoke "Winch Green" Yonji
<font size="45">Germa 66</font></font></font></font>

281
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,490
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="55">Vinsmoke "Winch Green" Yonji
<font size="45">Germa 66</font></font></font>

282
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yonji?!</font>

283
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not "San(three)-ji" but "Yon(four)-ji"?!</font>

284
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He resembles him
and has twirly eyebrows but he's not him?!</font>

285
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My relationship with your friend Sanji
is a secret of secrets.</font>

286
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's absolutely confidential!</font>

287
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's definitely his younger brother...</font>

288
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he also had a younger brother...</font>

289
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! How can you tell
that's his younger brother?!</font>

290
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cutie! Cute, so cute...</font>

291
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really not Sanji?!</font>

292
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness.</font>

293
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think they are transporting
Prince Sanji on that ship.</font>

294
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I guess we missed each other.</font>

295
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right. Let's go back.
It was a wasted trip.</font>

296
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Sanji!</font>

297
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Yonji!</font>

298
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Luffy...</font>

299
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rash is breaking out all over his body!</font>

300
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's losing his resistance!</font>

301
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This poison is so severe!
Luffy may have strong antibodies, but it's...</font>

302
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, stay with us!</font>

303
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, it's just fish poison!
I thought you were gonna be the pirate king!</font>

304
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Don't die!</font>

305
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-<i>san<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

306
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, please!
I bet you have antidotes!</font>

307
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We used all we got,
but he still needs more!</font>

308
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

309
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're Sanji-<i>san</i>'s brother,
please save Luffy-<i>san<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

310
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.
I have no interest in saving people.</font>

311
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or do you wanna try and
rob the medicine from us?</font>

312
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like pirates?</font>

313
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a jerk!</font>

314
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's totally different from Sanji-<i>kun<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!
Even though he likes girls too!

315
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not kind at all!</font>

316
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just say the word if you want me to kill him!</font>

317
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yonji.</font>

318
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop being so stingy!</font>

319
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!</font>

320
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

321
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

322
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Lady Reiju!</font>

323
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

324
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

325
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Luffy-<i>san<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!
– No!

326
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An invader!</font>

327
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

328
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello. I'm sorry.</font>

329
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My young brother is a cold-blooded jackass.</font>

330
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young brother?</font>

331
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you his sister?</font>

337
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he flying?!</font>

338
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bitch!
How could you humiliate me?!</font>

339
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!
You should be ashamed of yourself!</font>

340
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Is he hovering in the air?</font>

341
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's science!</font>

342
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

343
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa 66 is a group of fighters
who have honed themselves with science.</font>

344
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are a scientific
fighting squad, if you will.</font>

345
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Mama is...</font>

Vinsmoke was...</font>

348
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the name of a royal family, wasn't it?</font>

349
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I remember right, it was a family that</font>

350
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">conquered the North Blue
by force of arms long ago!</font>

351
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By "royal family,"
you mean like Vivi and Neptune?!</font>

352
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Are they such a prominent family?</font>

353
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. They were synonymous
with "evil" in a past age.</font>

354
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why they were used as
models for the comic strip.</font>

355
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skeleton-<i>san</i>,
you have so much historical knowledge.</font>

356
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lived a long time...</font>

357
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm dead now though.</font>

358
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:32,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's not just a story from the past.
We're still a royal family.</font>

359
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa is a country without soil.</font>

360
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no land to govern,
but we're given the right to attend the Reverie.</font>

361
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I beg your pardon.</font>

362
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that is so, may I see your panties?</font>

363
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

364
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, now, can I have it?</font>

365
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like he ate an armored stonefish
from the Boiling Sea, didn't he?</font>

366
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? How did you know?</font>

367
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way this poison works is unique.</font>

368
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be greedy.
It could even kill a giant instantly.</font>

369
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Oh, no!
Then, there's no way to save Luffy...</font>

370
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shouldn't be a ship's doctor anymore!</font>

371
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this boy is lucky.</font>

372
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because this poison is...</font>

373
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">one of my favorite things!</font>

374
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What are you gonna do?</font>

375
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's have it!</font>

376
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
If you suck up poison like that, you're gonna die!</font>

377
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! I'm jealous! Smooch!</font>

378
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I could change places with him!
Even though my lips...</font>

379
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are gone!</font>

380
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rash is transferring to her body!</font>

381
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

382
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rash on Luffy's body is all gone!</font>

383
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've sucked it all out?! Are you alright?!</font>

384
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, of course. I'm Poison Pink.</font>

385
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison...</font>

386
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Pink?</font>

387
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was delicious!</font>

388
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! What happened?!</font>

389
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Luffy!</font>

390
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– I'm so relieved!
– Are you all right?!</font>

391
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief!</font>

392
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

393
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Did I fall asleep while eating fish?</font>

394
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The skin was so good! Is there any left?</font>

395
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– No! Don't you remember?!
– Nope.</font>

396
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

397
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's a woman!</font>

398
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right. Who is this?</font>

399
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-<i>san</i>, she saved your life!</font>

400
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Thank you for... what again?</font>

401
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

402
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! You're Sanji's sister!</font>

403
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

404
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji is one of us, the Vinsmoke family.</font>

405
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our father parted from Sanji
when he was a little kid</font>

406
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and has been looking for him.</font>

407
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Sanji's wanted poster 
was circulated two years ago,</font>

408
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">our father immediately asked 
Navy Headquarters to pursue him.</font>

409
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they found the wrong man—
someone named Duval.</font>

410
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Duval!</font>

411
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the guy from the Flying Fish Riders
who we met before Sabaody...</font>

412
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I remember!
Sanji-<i>san</i> was mad about it too.</font>

413
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was only recently
that the government called us saying</font>

414
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that they finally captured an image
of Black Leg Sanji amid the chaos</font>

415
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">evoked by the Straw Hats' comeback.</font>

416
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our father raised the bounty right away</font>

417
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and made them change "DEAD OR ALIVE"...</font>

418
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... to "ONLY ALIVE."</font>

419
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why only Sanji-<i>kun</i>'s poster was
changed a little bit.</font>

420
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is Sanji now?</font>

421
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

422
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he's with Big Mom or with our father.</font>

423
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We came to greet him,
but I think we missed each other.</font>

424
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if he can attend the tea party,
that's all that matters.</font>

425
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I got to see you guys, too.</font>

426
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for looking after my brother
all this time.</font>

427
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji's sister!</font>

428
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for saving my life.</font>

429
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

430
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I still want Sanji back! He's my friend!</font>

431
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna take back Sanji at any cost!</font>

432
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? She saved our enemy's life.</font>

433
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you!
You're Pekoms from the Big Mom Pirates, right?</font>

434
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you with the Straw Hats?</font>

435
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have my own reason!
Why do I have to explain it to you guys?!</font>

436
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no bond between us yet!</font>

437
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!</font>

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll pretend that I didn't
see anything for now.</font>

439
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we don't wanna cause trouble and
break off our brother's marriage.</font>

440
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd best all tread lightly.</font>

441
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd be smart!</font>

442
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weigh anchor! Let's go back.</font>

443
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, good luck.</font>

444
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They didn't get into a fight with Germa,
it seems.</font>

445
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I'm sure that's their ship.
Straw Hat Luffy is on board, too.</font>

446
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you wanna do...</font>

447
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe?</font>
