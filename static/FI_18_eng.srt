33
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be any good if I break the outside bubble

40
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull!  Pull!</font>

41
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't stop it, but maybe we can
slow it down a tiny bit for the Princess...</font>

43
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull!</font>

44
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop the Noah!</font>

45

51
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Stop it!</font>

52
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You little pieces of filth.</font>

53

54

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone...</font>

55
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard!</font>

56
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess... run away... quickly... please...</font>

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought,</font>

58
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entrance to Ryuuguu Palace was left open!</font>

59
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't die on me, now!</font>

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you Hody!</font>

61
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She used the connecting channel to get into the sea!</font>

63
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Noah's following her!</font>

64
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess!  Please keep going!</font>

65
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa!  It's goin' up!</font>

66
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait up, chain!</font>

67
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You act all high and mighty on land...</font>

68
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but in the sea, you couldn't even put up a decent fight
against a fishman child!</font>

69
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This really is the limit of human strength.</font>

70
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make you regret ever opposing me.</font>

71
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

72
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,140

73
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The walls of Koukaku Tower kept you safe

74
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you die from blood loss?</font>

75
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or will you be smashed by this behemoth first?</font>

76
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you one last chance, Shirahoshi.</font>

77
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say <i>yes</i>, and I'll spare your life.  It's still not too late!</font>

78
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm terribly sorry, Decken-sama, but...</font>

79
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marry me!</font>

80

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...you're just not my-</font>

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, die!</font>

82
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think we'd let you marry her?</font>

83
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let you put a single finger on our only sister, Decken!</font>

84
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dearest brothers,
Manboshi-sama and Ryuuboshi-sama!  And Hoe-sama!{ def: double check for three lines in workraw-sd }</font>

85
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,300

86
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're not your brothers!</i></font>

87
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dearest brothers, everyone in the plaza tried to...</font>

88
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!  Save the crying for later!</font>

89
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dearest brothers are angry?</font>

90
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not angry!</font>

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father said that the Noah is an important ship,
so we can't allow it to get a single scratch -la-ti-do!</font>

92
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means we have to return it
to the sea floor without damaging it!</font>

93
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!</font>

94
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!  In any case, we can't swim near the underwater mountains or ravines.</font>

95
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would damage the Noah!</font>

96
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So where should I escape to, dearest Manboshi?</font>

97
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up!  There are too many obstacles on the sea floor!</font>

98
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand!</font>

99
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll get Decken.</font>

100
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the Noah... and my endless love...
you will never be able to escape, Shirahoshi!</font>

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, thanks!  You saved me!</font>

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does the wound that you got from Hody
still bother you?</font>

103
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you get away, Straw Hat!</font>

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time to worry about a wound like this!</font>

105
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may be a member of the merman race, who pride themselves on being the world's fastest swimmers...</font>

106
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but compared to me, it's like you're not even moving.</font>

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy.</font>

108
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Shark cutter</i></font>

109
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, get me onto the ship's deck!</font>

110
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like Jinbe said...</font>

111
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Do you think there's water inside the ship, Jinbe? { from 558 }</i></font>

112
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm not sure, but Decken is a Devil Fruit user...</i></font>

113
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>so we can assume that there must be air in there somewhere since he can make the ship move. { end 558 }</i></font>

114
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it should be easier to fight in there.</font>

115
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to defeat both Hody and
that guy who keeps throwing things.</font>

116
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promised Weak-hoshi that I would protect her
when I took her out of the tower.</font>

117
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A promise, you say...</font>

118
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We'll become great soldiers like our father. {21:07.03 in ep 546}</i></font>

119
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Just as we promised,
we'll protect Shirahoshi with our lives! { end 546 }</i></font>

120
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've made a promise too.</font>

121
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His strength is nothing more than a mockery, borrowed from the Energy Steroids.</font>

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pitiful to think that
I couldn't stand up to that rogue.</font>

123
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive us for doubting you earlier.</font>

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it.  Just get me onto the deck!</font>

125
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there something you want on the deck?</font>

126
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody!</font>

127
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up, up...</font>

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Hody Jones.</font>

129
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's Neptune?  Did you kill him?</font>

130
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just in the middle

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sounds good...</font>

153
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you'll be first!</font>

158
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then the ship will resume its descent, and fall upon Fishman Island!</font>
