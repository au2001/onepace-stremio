83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,300

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We finally made it!</font>

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Ryunosuke! Good job!</font>

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,340

<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This is absurd.</font>

95

97
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Is that how you thank him for bringing you up here?!</font>

98
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We're in unknown territory.
We shouldn't look back.</font>

99
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You're right but...</font>

100
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Usopp! Ryunosuke was a good guy, wasn't he?!</font>

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Always pay attention to what lies ahead. Look.</font>

102
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That must be a gate into the country.</font>

103
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There is certainly civilization on the elephant's back.</font>

104
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There's a watchtower but no guards.
It's not security befitting a country.</font>

105
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Tsk! They're so cold!</font>

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Honestly! You guys snapped out of it too quickly!</font>

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey, Usopp! Come up here!
It's amazing!</font>

108
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You climbed the watchtower so quickly!</font>

109
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's awesome!</font>

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">So this is the back of the elephant!</font>

111
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No kidding!
Is this really the elephant's back?!</font>

112
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's so interesting!</font>

113
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There's a massive, millennia-old elephant...</font>

114
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">And there's a country on its back!</font>

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah!</font>

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It has a forest, a river, and a town!</font>

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This sure is awesome!
It's exactly like an island!</font>

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Usopp! That tree's like a whale!</font>

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You're right!</font>

120
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The town is bigger than I thought!</font>

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">But that town is sort of...</font>

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Luffy jumped down!</font>

123
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I knew he'd do that.
Do you see old "Eyebrows"?</font>

124
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No.</font>

125
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This place is too high to see anybody.</font>

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Zoro, shouldn't we wait for Kin'emon and Kanjuro?</font>

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's not as vast as a continent.
Let's just go.</font>

128
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Wait, wait!
I'm coming with you guys!</font>

129
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">He didn't have to jump. The gate's open.</font>

130
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No, I think this is...</font>

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah, it's not actually open...</font>

132
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Someone destroyed it.</font>

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You're right.</font>

134
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This trail looks strange too.</font>

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's too wide to call it an animal trail in a forest.</font>

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey, this is some pretty serious destruction!</font>

137
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">And it's still fresh.
Are Sanji and the others gonna be okay?!</font>

138
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What a mess!</font>

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I couldn't see it from up there but what's going on here?!</font>

140
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Let's proceed with caution!</font>

141
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What?! We don't really know the residents here and we have other enemies?!</font>

142
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Whoa-whoa, hey!</font>

143
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">W-W-W-Wait a minute, guys! Please!</font>

144
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You don't need to rush like that!</font>

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's hard to walk.</font>

146
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah, it's elephant's skin.</font>

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There are flowers in such strange spots.</font>

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What happened to Bariete?</font>

149
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The Lesser Minks passed through the gate.</font>

150
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">He might've been taken down!</font>

151
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's a town!</font>

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No one's here!
What's wrong with this country?!</font>

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">They're all run-down!</font>

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey! Sanji! Nami!</font>

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Chopper! Brook! Momo!</font>

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh, and the gas guy.
Well, forget about him.</font>

157
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What happened here?</font>

158
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I smell the faint odor of gunpowder...
And gas, do you?</font>

159
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What's this all about? Can't we just lie back in a peaceful country sometimes?!</font>

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What?! What is it?!
Do you see something?!</font>

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I got this.</font>

162
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Did she just...</font>

163
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">...jump in midair?!</font>

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What the...?!</font>

165
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Wait! Stop, Carrot!</font>

166
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Forget about them-teia!</font>

167
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">More importantly, we have an invader in the Whale Forest!</font>

168
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Talking animals?!</font>

169
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">They're the Mink Tribe!</font>

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh?! I-Isn't that outfit...</font>

171
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">...Nami's?!</font>

172
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What is that weapon?
I felt a shock for a moment!</font>

173
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We have an invader in the Whale Forest?!</font>

174
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yes, we're in trouble!</font>

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The Guardians will be mad!</font>

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">An animal?!</font>

177
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">A human?!</font>

178
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey, you!
Where did you get that outfit?!</font>

179
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What did you do to Nami?!</font>

180
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Are they a cannibal tribe?</font>

181
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Don't say such a scary thing!</font>

182
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I'm sorry! Don't eat me!</font>

183
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Look how high she can jump!</font>

184
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Do all of them have physical abilities like that?!</font>

185
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">How is it?!</font>

186
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Do you see something, Carrot?!</font>

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I do! Maybe it's a little too late!</font>

188
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">On the other side of Kurau City,
there's a disturbance in the Whale Forest!</font>

189
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I thought so! Let's go, Warney!</font>

190
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Get on, Carrot!</font>

191
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We don't have time to
transport you-teia guys!</font>

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Do as I say!</font>

193
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Go through the Rightrump Forest to your right</font>

194
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">and turn left at a deep dark swamp...
You'll reach the Rightflank Forest!</font>

195
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You'll find the corpse of your-teia friend there!</font>

196
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">C-Corpse?!</font>

197
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Wait at the Rightflank Forest!
We'll be there later!</font>

198
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Do you think they-teia are gonna be okay?</font>

199
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Those were the Straw Hats.</font>

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Huh? They-teia are gonna be shocked.</font>

201
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's a shame but there's nothing we can do.
What's done is done.</font>

202
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The one who just invaded the Whale Forest is probably a pirate, Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

203
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">He's their-teia captain but I'm sure the Guardians will show no mercy!</font>

204
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">They were killed!</font>

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">She said there's a corpse...
Which means they weren't cannibalized.</font>

206
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's not the problem! Cut it out!</font>

207
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Calm down!</font>

208
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Old "Spiral Eyebrows" is with them.
He won't let anyone be killed.</font>

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah. They're not gonna be killed that easily!</font>

210
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This must be a trick to make us upset and submissive!</font>

211
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You're right. I can't believe it.</font>

212
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Tra-guy-kun.</font>

213
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Your friends must be here, right?  Is there any way to make contact?</font>

214
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No.</font>

215
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I didn't even expect to see them again.</font>

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">But now I remember.</font>

217
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I forgot that I had a Vivre Card.</font>

218
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It belongs to our navigator, Bepo.</font>

219
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh yeah, you had a talking polar bear in your crew!</font>

220
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Is he a Mink too?!</font>

221
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah.</font>

222
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This is where he was born.</font>

223
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">But he didn't remember much about this island.</font>

224
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Because he left the island when he was little.</font>

225
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I've known him for a decade.
We can trust him.</font>

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">If you wanna get reliable information, let's head straight.</font>

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh, I looked around from up there before!
If we go straight, there'll be a town!</font>

228
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We don't know who are there!
Are we gonna be okay?!</font>

229
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The cannibal tribe might be there...</font>

230
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's better than going along with the unknown animal.</font>

231
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Let's follow him.</font>

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,830
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Whale Forest</font>

233
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Rubber...</font>

234
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Moo Golova!</font>

235
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Bell!</font>

236
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Why isn't Electro having any effect?!</font>

237
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's it! Stop right there!</font>

238
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I know him!</font>

239
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Even if you know him, he's an invader!</font>

240
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I guess we gotta stop you by force!</font>

241
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Don't get in our way!</font>

242
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No! Jean Bart!</font>

243
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Damn! This is too much to handle!</font>

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">He's too strong!</font>

245
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's enough, Guardians!</font>

246
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">A fluttering object!</font>

247
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">A banana!</font>

248
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah! I got a banana!</font>

249
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,560
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Whale Forest Guardian (Bull Mink)
Roddy</font>

250
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,560
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Whale Forest Guardian (Gorilla Mink)
 BB</font>

251
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yum! Yum, yum, yum...</font>

252
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">So this is how you handle them.</font>

253
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">A dog?</font>

254
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,580
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Battlebeast Tribe (Dog Mink)
Wanda</font>

255
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You-teia are Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?</font>

256
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I'm Wanda.</font>

257
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,870
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Battlebeast Tribe (Rabbit Mink)
Carrot</font>

258
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">She's Carrot.</font>

259
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We won't do anything to you so stop resisting.</font>

260
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There are a bunch of strange creatures in this country.</font>

261
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's like having a ton of Choppers.</font>

262
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What's with them?!</font>

263
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I didn't even do anything but they attacked me!</font>

264
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's because you-teia invaded the forest where you mustn't enter.</font>

265
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh! Wh-What are you doing?!</font>

266
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Guardians!</font>

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We'll take him out of here!</font>

268
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Please forgive him!</font>

269
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">For Wanda's sake...</font>

270
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Let's retreat, Roddy!</font>

271
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">BB!</font>

272
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Pedro!</font>

273
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Everyone, retreat!</font>

274
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Was I surrounded?</font>

275
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Just be thankful this wasn't a moonlit night.</font>

276
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey, Straw Hat, don't you remember us?</font>

277
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We took care of you after the Paramount War!</font>

278
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I'm shocked!</font>

279
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh! You're the talking bear from Tra-guy's crew!</font>

280
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Tra-guy?</font>

281
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No, we work under Trafalgar Law!</font>

282
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,800
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Navigator of the Heart Pirates
Guardians's helper Bepo</font>

283
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The Heart Pirates!</font>

284
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's what I said.</font>

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">No, you didn't!</font>

286
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Well, we've been reading newspapers!</font>

287
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There was a whole bunch of surprising news!</font>

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We're allied, aren't we?</font>

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Is our captain here too?</font>

290
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah, Tra-guy's here!</font>

291
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">You got it wrong again! Who is that?!</font>

292
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Tra-guy is Law.</font>

293
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh yeah? I didn't know that.</font>

294
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">So our captain, he's here! Yeah!</font>

295
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Captain, I can't wait to see you!</font>

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,150

Kurau City</font>

297
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">I guess there's no doubt that it was attacked.</font>

298
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This city could have as many as several hundred thousand residents but not a single person is here.</font>

299
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We shouldn't be out in the open like this!</font>

300
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">The enemies must be around here still!</font>

301
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Is this a device for torture?</font>

302
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">We can't even tell whether the enemies are humans or not.</font>

303
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There are so many claw marks.</font>

304
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Yeah, what are those?!</font>

305
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Hey, come see this.</font>

306
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">It's a giant footstep.</font>

307
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Do you think it's an elephant?</font>

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Did some monsters and beasts attack the Minks' country?</font>

309
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">But looking at those claw marks, it might be internal discord.</font>

310
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">One thing is for sure.</font>

311
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This country was suddenly ruined only one or two weeks ago.</font>

312
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Th-Then Sanji and everyone else...</font>

313
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">...were involved in it?!</font>

314
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Ruined?</font>

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">That's why no one's there.</font>

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This centuries-old country's name is
Mokomo Dukedom.</font>

317
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">When I trace my memories back to just a half-month ago, I can see everyone's happy face.</font>

318
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">This country was ruined by...</font>

319
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">...Jack!</font>

320
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Oh! What is this?!</font>

321
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What's going on?!</font>

322
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">There'll be a Rain-Ruption!</font>

323
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Climb a tree!</font>

324
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Get on Warney!
I'll take you to the Rightflank!</font>

325
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Your friends are there!</font>

326
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">Great! So Sanji and the others are there!</font>

327
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="56">What's wrong?!</font>
