74
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

75
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got your shadow back?</font>

76

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so surprised that I dropped the family heirloom plates!</font>

80
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had a grudge against them, but not anymore.</font>

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't mean to break them.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm terribly sorry.</font>

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll leave the mansion immediately.</font>

84
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you talking about?</font>

85
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were just some plates after all.</font>

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you get hurt?</font>

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's celebrate.</font>

88
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so happy for you, Margarita.</font>

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you happy?</font>

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems we're alive.</font>

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a moment, I felt like I was going to heaven.</font>

94
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's fine!</font>

95
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't mind going to heaven as long as it's with Robin-chan!</font>

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't funny, you idiots!</font>

97
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really thought you were dead! You were vanishing into thin air!</font>

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a scary view.</font>

99
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The morning sun!</font>

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have to fear the sun anymore!</font>

101
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have our shadows!</font>

102
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our days in that gloomy forest are finally over!</font>

103
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

104
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone over there seems fine as well.</font>

106
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our existence was erased for a moment, when the sun shone upon us.</font>

107
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But at the last second, our shadows returned. Thus our bodies were regenerated.</font>

108
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like Moriah said when he transformed the shadow to change the body's shape.</font>

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As far as I understand, shadow and body must have the same shape.</font>

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take it easy.</font>

111
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never again will your shadow and body be separated in such a strange way.</font>

112
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I'm glad no one was completely erased.</font>

113
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel sleepy all of a sudden.</font>

114
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does anyone have cola?</font>

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All these weird creatures we've come across since we entered this island...</font>

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were merely illusions created by Moriah.</font>

117
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that he's gone, there's nothing left on the island.</font>

118
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything disappears, like the morning after waking up from a nightmare.</font>

119
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly a devilish haunted mansion.</font>

120
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up!</font>

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom!</font>

122
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wake up!</font>

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola!</font>

124
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't panic.</font>

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It no longer has a shadow.</font>

126
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hogback.</font>

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to me?</font>

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea what happened to you.</font>

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beaten by someone I assume, pathetic.</font>

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, Moriah-sama was-</font>

131
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

132
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama was beaten by Straw Hat?!</font>

133
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't talk so loud!</font>

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet!</font>

135
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too loud!</font>

136
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark is nothing but a worthless pile of rubble now.</font>

137
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't plan on spending my days as a loser!</font>

138
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about you?</font>

139
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me?</font>

140
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't Luffy's body shrink a while ago?</font>

141
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's body shrinks for a moment as a side effect of that Giant Gear.</font>

142
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His new techniques are too much for his body, aren't they?</font>

143
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stronger the enemies we encounter, the more reckless this guy will get.</font>

144
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we keep going like this...</font>

145
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A zombie!</font>

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So there was still one left?!</font>

147
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, just a heavily injured old man.</font>

148
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! You're practically a zombie!</font>

149
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that geezer we met at the graveyard.</font>

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it.</font>

151
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think the day would come when we could walk under the sun again.</font>

152
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you so much!</font>

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can we ever repay this favor!</font>

154
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Old man Spoil!</font>

155
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man!</font>

156
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">President of the victim association!</font>

157
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! You guys are fine too?</font>

158
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, are you?</font>

159
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

160
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know each other?</font>

161
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, you two, where's your gratitude?</font>

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We too, thank you from the bottom of our hearts!</font>

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I apologize for all the sudden meddling and all!</font>

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just that when we saw you guys rampaging, we decided to take a chance, and place our hopes in you!</font>

165
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much!</font>

166
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I speak for everyone in the Thriller Bark Victim Association when I say...</font>

167
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will never forget this debt!</font>

168
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much!</font>

169
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feel free to ask for anything!</font>

170
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though it's not much, we have plenty of food.</font>

171
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In return, you can marry me.</font>

172
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell no!</font>

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You keep thanking us, but...</font>

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't say that!</font>

175
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like Luffy said, old man.</font>

176
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You there!</font>

177
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We had our own reasons for fighting.</font>

178
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Won't you marry me?!</font>

179
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just happened to help you by accident.</font>

180
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?!</font>

181
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they want to thank us so badly, then let them do it!</font>

182
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, bro!</font>

183
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ask anything you want!</font>

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether it was an accident or not, we're very grateful you defeated Moriah!</font>

185
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so?</font>

186
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um... Your eyes...</font>

187
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! I completely forgot about it!</font>

188
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter?</font>

189
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I forgot about him!</font>

190
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is something wrong?</font>

191
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in big trouble!</font>

192
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I see.</i></font>

193
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So it turned out as I feared.</i></font>

194
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It appears so.</font>

195
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that over there?</font>

196
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's here.</font>

197
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay calm and listen.</font>

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't want to bring this up while in the middle of the battle with Moriah, but...</font>

199
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On this island...</font>

200
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was another...</font>

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warlord of the Sea!</font>

202
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you just say?!</font>

203
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a...</font>

204
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warlord of the Sea?!</font>

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when we finally found a replacement for Crocodile.</font>

206
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't afford to have another empty gap in the Warlords.</font>

207
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there still breath in him?</font>

208
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows.</font>

209
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as there's a breath of life in him,</font>

210
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we will wait for his recovery and allow him to take up his place as a Warlord again.</font>

211
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll worry about that later.</font>

212
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we keep losing one after another, the dignity of the Warlords will end up disappearing.</font>

213
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't let this information get spread around the world.</font>

214
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, what a bunch of troublemakers.</font>

215
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true... Even Moriah falls short of that giant's size,</font>

216
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pirate known as "The Tyrant",</font>

217
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

218
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is Kuma the Tyrant?!</font>

219
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand what I'm saying?</font>

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must not be any witnesses of Moriah's defeat.</font>

221
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a direct order from the World Government...</font>

222
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat crew, along with any survivors on the island must be...</font>

223
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">eliminated.</font>

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Simple enough.</font>

225
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that just now?!</font>

226
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he say "eliminated"?!</font>

227
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Eliminate...</font>

228
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Us?!</font>

229
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe this is happening!</font>

231
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when we finally got free from Moriah's power!</font>

232
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

233
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to fight two Warlords consecutively?!</font>

234
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, step back.</font>

235
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll handle this!</font>

236
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! {Padding before this with breathing. Cut if possible}</font>

237
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's got some sort of ability!</font>

238
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He completely let a person vanish just by touching her with his hand!</font>

239
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He vanished a person just by touching them?!</font>

240
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So scary! {Non-Canon}</font>

241
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plus, he can move instantly from one location to another!</font>

242
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those hands are dangerous!</font>

243
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's here!</font>

245
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's huge!</font>

246
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did he-</font>

247
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! Just when we finally got our freedom!</font>

248
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'm gonna die in this place!</font>

249
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! We won't let anyone get in our way anymore!</font>

250
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, get him!</font>

251
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, yes! Get him!</font>

252
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you fools!</font>

253
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're no match for him!</font>

254
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the guys who weren't touched were pierced by something.</font>

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate Hunter Zoro.</font>

256
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll start with you.</font>

257
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hang in there!</font>

258
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?</font>

259
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell did he do?!</font>

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something went through him without touching him!</font>

261
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's his ability?</font>

262
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a cruel thing to do.</font>

263
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when we finally managed to break free from our suffering in Moriah's forest after so many years.</font>

264
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't even have the chance to celebrate before another Shichibukai shows up to exterminate us all.</font>

265
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't fair!</font>

266
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't know what the Straw Hats went through to finish this battle!</font>

267
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will fight in their place, regardless of the odds!</font>

268
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if our enemy is a Warlord!</font>

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not as tough as Moriah or Oars anyways!</font>

270
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up and stay back!</font>

271
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's after me, didn't you hear him?</font>

272
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take him on.</font>

273
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't need your help.</font>

274
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't humiliate me.</font>

275
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You people have quite a reputation.</font>

276
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat's ship sure is full of exceptional people.</font>

277
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the time to feel flattered!</font>

278
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've caused too many disturbances.</font>

279
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not just your captain; your whole crew has become quite noteworthy.</font>

280
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro, wait!</font>

281
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be reckless!</font>

282
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're completely worn out, aren't you?!</font>

283
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When it rains, it pours; disasters hit one after another.</font>

284
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like anything will change if we complain.</font>

285
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I die here, it means this is as far as I could go!</font>

286
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two Sword Style...</font>

287
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Draw and Resheath Technique!</font>

288
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Castle Gate!</font>

289
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell was that?!</font>

290
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! It didn't even touch him and he's already hurting!</font>

291
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is his ability?!</font>

292
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that mark he left in the rubble?!</font>

293
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! His palm!</font>

294
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A p-paw?!</font>

295
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can a human have paws?</font>

296
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">36 Pound Cannon!</font>

297
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out!</font>

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He deflected Zoro's attack with his hand!</font>

299
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can he do that?!</font>

300
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's your ability.</font>

301
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power to deflect anything.</font>

302
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a paw-man with the power of the Paw Fruit.</font>

303
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A paw-man?!</font>

304
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sounds so harmless.</font>

305
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are there more lamely named fruits out there?</font>

306
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno whether he's a Warlord or a charitable guy, but...</font>

307
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're probably overestimating this guy.</font>

308
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

309
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

310
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cyborg Franky.</font>

311
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that all you have to offer?</font>

312
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might be deflecting the air...</font>

313
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mere artillery is useless against Franky.</font>

314
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's called Pad Cannon.</font>

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The air deflected at the speed of light generates a powerful shock wave that can pierce through anything.</font>

316
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your time's up.</font>

317
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swift Pad Cannon!</font>

318
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Streaming Wolf Blades!</font>

319
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

320
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He repelled even that attack!</font>

321
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

322
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It’s useless!</font>

323
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't keep this up!</font>

324
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a miracle that he can even fight in that condition!</font>

325
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took enough damage to kill a normal human just from that monster Oars!</font>

326
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, behind you!</font>

327
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

328
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

329
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's as far as you go!</font>

330
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Grind</i></font>

331
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Concasse!</font>

332
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

333
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try deflecting that with your paws!</font>

334
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your skull must've been smashed to bits, bastard!</font>

335
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, mind your own...</font>

336
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg Sanji.</font>

337
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's you.</font>

338
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't even falter from Sanji's kick.</font>

339
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

340
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with his toughness?!</font>

341
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is his face made of steel?!</font>

342
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">F-F-Fire Bird Star!</font>

343
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King of the Snipers.</font>

344
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an outrageous alias.</font>

345
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no interest in destroying you all when you are in such a worn-out state.</font>

346
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My mission is to exterminate every single one of you, but...</font>

347
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he doing?</font>

348
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The air...</font>

349
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he compressing the air with his paws?</font>

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's getting smaller.</font>

351
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:36,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By deflecting the atmosphere with his paws he's pressurizing lots of air, condensing it more and more.</font>

352
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power of that much condensed air, trying to return to its former size...</font>

353
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will without a doubt generate a massive shock wave.</font>

354
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like a bomb.</font>

355
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

356
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bomb?!</font>

357
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean he's creating a bomb?!</font>

358
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will spare your lives.</font>

359
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in exchange,</font>

360
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want you to bring me Straw Hat Luffy's head.</font>

361
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as they have him, the government won't mind.</font>

362
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Betray our comrade...?!</font>

363
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, bring him to me.</font>

364
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We refuse!</font>

365
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a shame.</font>

366
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ursus Shock.</font>

367
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lion's Song!</font>

368
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell are you?!</font>

369
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A cyborg, just like Franky?!</font>

370
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No. His body is even harder than steel!</font>

371
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He melted the steel...</font>

372
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cyborg.</font>

373
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's certainly true.</font>

374
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm completely different from Cyborg Franky.</font>

375
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm what is called a Pacifista.</font>

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human weapon from the government that is yet to be completed.</font>

377
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pacifista?</font>

378
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was developed by the government's genius scientist.</font>

379
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dr. Vegapunk.</font>

380
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is the most brilliant person in the world.</font>

381
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:40,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is said his knowledge is 500 years ahead of our time.</font>

382
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he possesses such a body, and he's a Devil's Fruit user!</font>

383
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't hope to beat that.</font>

384
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And as expected, I can no longer move.</font>

385
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:01,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there anything I can do to stop you from taking Luffy's head?</font>

386
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's as far as I can negotiate.</font>

387
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand.</font>

388
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, go ahead and take it...</font>

389
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

390
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not his head!</font>

391
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg you to take my life instead of his!</font>

392
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may not be as worthy as him yet, but...</font>

393
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The head of the man who would one day become the strongest swordsman...</font>

394
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't bad either!</font>

395
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even with such an ambition, you'd sacrifice yourself for this man?</font>

396
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way I see it, this is the only way to help the crew.</font>

397
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can I protect my ambition when I can't even protect my captain!</font>

398
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's the man who is gonna be the Pirate King!</font>

399
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it, hold it, you bastard!</font>

400
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What'll happen if you die?</font>

401
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about your ambition, idiot?</font>

402
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, big guy!</font>

403
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

404
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget this moss-head swordsman.</font>

405
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take my life instead!</font>

406
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Marines are still taking me lightly, but...</font>

407
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before long, the one who's bound to become the most dangerous person in this crew is...</font>

408
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me, Black-Leg Sanji!</font>

409
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you waiting for?</font>

410
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm prepared to exchange my life for his!</font>

411
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The flower of my glorious death shall bloom on this spot.</font>

412
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, make sure to...</font>

413
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say goodbye to everyone for me.</font>

414
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell them I'm sorry, but they'll have to look for a new cook.</font>

415
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Why you!</font>

416
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's my last request.</font>

417
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to claim Straw Hat's life after this, I'd feel ashamed.</font>

418
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in your debt.</font>

419
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trust me in what I'm about to do,</font>

420
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll keep my promise no matter what.</font>

421
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in exchange, I will make you...</font>

422
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Experience hell itself.</font>

423
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What I just extracted from his body is his pain and fatigue.</font>

424
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the damage he accumulated during his battle with Moriah is within this.</font>

425
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you really intend to take his place, then you must literally share his suffering.</font>

426
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Adding such damage to your current condition will eliminate your chances of survival.</font>

427
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be certain death.</font>

428
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a taste.</font>

429
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How was it?</font>

430
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let me... do this somewhere else!</font>

431
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has good friends.</font>

432
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from your son,</font>

433
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dragon.</font>

434
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is everyone alright?!</font>

435
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was so sure that attack would be enough to exterminate us all that he didn't even check if it did!</font>

436
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that, stupid bear-man!</font>

437
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurts.</font>

438
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, are you kidding me?</font>

439
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?</font>

440
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey look, my body is as light as a feather!</font>

441
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno why!</font>

442
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar, that's not possible!</font>

443
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he took so much damage that now he feels fine.</font>

444
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not as simple as that!</font>

445
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did that idiot go?!</font>

446
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is.</font>

447
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure scared me for a second.</font>

448
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where did that Warlord-</font>

449
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with all this blood!?</font>

450
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

451
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you alive?!</font>

452
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is he?!</font>

453
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell happened here?!</font>

454
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No-</font>

455
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing...</font>

456
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">at all!</font>
