75
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I wanna hear it! I'm sure Laboon would love to hear it, too!</font>

76
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then...</font>

81
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like we're all gonna die, huh?</font>

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're pirates, so we were prepared to die at any time, but...</font>

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we didn't think we'd all die at once...!</font>

84

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon...</font>

85
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook... About that Revive Fruit of yours...</font>

86
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows... I have never died before, but... I have an idea!</font>

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will die anyway, so let us die while having fun...</font>

88
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we sing a song?</font>

89
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the power of the Revive Fruit really will bring me back to life...</font>

90
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I will deliver it to him without fail!</font>

92
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This song that Laboon, the captain, and all of us loved...</font>

93
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Waiting for us at that cape, not knowing whether we will come today or tomorrow...</font>

94
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our comrade.... I will deliver it to Laboon!</font>

95
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great idea!</font>

96
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... You guys... Let's not fall until the end!</font>

97
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let him hear it...!</font>

98
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's give Laboon the Rumbar Pirates' once-in-a-lifetime performance!</font>

99
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,690

111
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,240
<font face="Kozuka Mincho Pr6N H" size="60">The waves our pillows, the ship our roost</font>

114
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,000

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you wanna join my crew, all I ask is that you love music!</i></font>

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is the ship of the Rumbar Pirates, who can even make a crying child laugh!</i></font>

132
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Laboon! We will definitely return here!</i></font>

133
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wait for us!</i></font>

134
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon... You have waited there for fifty years...</font>

135
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But can you wait for just another year or two?</font>

136
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For I, too, have the true spirit of a pirate!</font>

137
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are facing that wall and waiting for me... And just as we promised, when I meet you again...</font>

138
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be coming over that wall!</font>

139
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton!</font>

140
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the song over already?</font>

141
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give us another one! Just one more!</font>

142
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The song I once sung with my comrades, who were so full of life...</font>

143
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was the final performance of the Rumbar Pirates.</font>

144
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">During the fifty years when I was drifting alone in that dark, dark, sea of mist...</font>

145
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times did I listen to this...?</font>

146
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On that vast ship, all on my own,</font>

147
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this song was the only thing that made me feel that there was life besides my own.</font>

148
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, today, I have finally found new conviction in my heart...</font>

149
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I shall seal away this Tone Dial.</font>

150
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seal!</font>

151
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHAAAAT?! SO YOU REALLY CAN DO THAT?!</font>

152
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I now know that Laboon is still safe, and waiting for me...</font>

153
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I have gotten my shadow back, and can escape from these cursed waters.</font>

154
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This Dial, with everyone's voices recorded upon it,</font>

155
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is no longer going to be used so I can think back on the past...</font>

156
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is a song for Laboon.</font>

157
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every day was painful...</font>

158
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was truly unable to see any hope.</font>

159
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, now, Luffy-san...</font>

160
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am so glad to be alive!</font>

161
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I truly am glad to be alive!</font>

162
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, sure!</font>

163
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally, this day has come!</font>

164
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right.</font>

165
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I join your crew?</font>

166
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, why not.</font>

167
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHAT?! JUST LIKE THAT?!</font>

168
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HE JOINED?!</font>

169
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, whatever! We've got our musician! Hooray!</font>

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A musician! He's just bones, but he's our musician!</font>

171
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The musician we've always wanted!</font>

172
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so light, too!</font>

173
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That lightness is another thing that's great about you!</font>

174
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's great!</font>

175
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Because I am just bones~!</font>

176
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so funny!</font>

177
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Just bones! Just bones! Just bones! Just bones!</font>

178
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it!</font>

179
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They certainly are very lively.</font>

180
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do we keep gathering up people like that?</font>

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really understand, but they seem happy, don't they, Namizou?</font>

182
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess. Thanks.</font>

183
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it at all, but cheers!</font>

184
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no idea, but cheers!</font>

185
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">45 degrees!</font>

186
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon...</font>

187
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not turn back.</font>

188
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We always pushed on, straight forward.</font>

189
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That path was the only one we could take in order to come back to you.</font>

190
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To travel around the world was our goal, and you were waiting at the finish line.</font>

191
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right? So I will not turn back.
I will carry on, and see you again.</font>

192
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait for me!</font>

193
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will just be a little longer...</font>

194
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Laboon?</font>

195
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in a really good mood today, huh?</font>

196
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Allow me to introduce myself!</font>

197
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wanted-poster? You had a bounty?</font>

198
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have still not introduced myself properly... I am "Dead Bones", and my name is Brook!</font>

199
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am a wanted man... My title is "Humming Brook"!</font>

200
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My current bounty is 33 million bellies!</font>

201
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once the leader of an escort convoy,</font>

202
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:39,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and afterwards, musician and swordsman, and eventually acting Captain, of the Rumbar Pirates!</font>

203
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I offer my services and my life to captain Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

204
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope not to be a burden to you all!</font>

205
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shall work myself to the bone!</font>

206
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Let's have one more toast!</font>

207
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,230
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Two days later</font>

208
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magnificent! Thank you so much, Franky-san, Usopp-san!</font>

209
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem at all! This was easy!</font>

210
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My design was a great success!</font>

211
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I picked the flowers!</font>

212
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a magnificent grave...</font>

213
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, I couldn't possibly expect you to bring all those bones with you on Lion-chan.</font>

214
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Call it the Thousand Sunny next time, OK?</font>

215
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So strange that this Thriller Bark should have come from our own homeland, West Blue...</font>

216
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But here, in the earth of our homeland, they might at last be able to rest in peace.</font>

217
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, Brook, we'll be going now.</font>

218
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">We'll be going on ahead.</font>

219
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">See you later.</font>

220
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

221
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that surprised me. So, you have finally recovered?</font>

222
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. I just overslept a little.</font>

223
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that...</font>

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a dead sword... Yubashiri.
I was gonna give it a proper burial.</font>

225
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy is the man who is gonna be the Pirate King!</i></font>

226
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um...</font>

227
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, no...</font>

228
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that is right, I became a part of your crew.</font>

229
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, is that so? Well, you've got bad luck.</font>

230
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a pretty crazy crew, you know.</font>

231
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that way. I will do my best until I die.</font>

232
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, but I am already dead.</font>

233
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">OK! Now that Zoro's awake, let's head out to sea!</font>

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's head off to our next adventure!</font>

235
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">YEAH!!!</font>

236
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, you took off your bandages again?!</font>

237
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, 'cause they're hard to move around in.</font>

238
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I put them there so you wouldn't move around so much!</font>

239
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

240
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He sure recovered quickly. Are you already setting sail?</font>

241
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can take Brook's ship.</font>

242
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I fixed the helm and the sail.</font>

243
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks.</font>

244
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all you've done, we're really indebted to you.</font>

245
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We couldn't thank you enough no matter how hard we tried.</font>

246
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you marry me?</font>

247
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem like a nice lady, but I'm afraid I'm far too super for you.</font>

248
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a real shame to see you guys go!</font>

249
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Couldn't you stay and party for just a few more days?</font>

250
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! We're going to Fishman Island!</font>

251
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really excited!</font>

252
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet we'll meet some funny guys there!</font>

253
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And some beautiful mermaids! Ah, what I wouldn't love to do with one of them~!</font>

254
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if the mermaids will let me see their panties...</font>

255
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Don't be ridiculous!</font>

256
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaids don't wear panties!</font>

257
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While we're talking about how beautiful mermaids are...</font>

258
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hear even the Pirate Empress Hancock was totally overwhelmed...</font>

259
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaids~! Mermaids~!</font>

260
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surely they have tails instead of legs anyway?</font>

261
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you guys know that, anyway?</font>

262
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, well, about three years ago, before we came here, we went to Fishman Island! That place is the best!</font>

263
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola, you guys went to the New World?!</font>

264
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't go there! We were born in the New World!</font>

265
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My mama was a pirate, too.</font>

266
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that's right...</font>

267
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my mama's Vivrecard. I'll let you have it.</font>

268
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Paper?</font>

269
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! That's incredible!</font>

270
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola's mama is a great pirate!</font>

271
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take good care of it! It'll definitely be useful later!</font>

272
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's a Vivrecard?</font>

273
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? You don't know?</font>

274
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola, they only make Vivrecards in the New World.</font>

275
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that's true...</font>

276
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no ordinary paper.</font>

277
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's resistant to both fire and water.</font>

278
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you do is you take a few of your own fingernails to a shop,</font>

279
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and they use them to make you a special sheet of paper.</font>

280
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the "Card of Life", the Vivrecard.</font>

281
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you do, is you tear off pieces and give them to friends or family if they're going away.</font>

282
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this.</font>

283
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Vivrecard my mama gave me.</font>

284
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It moved!</font>

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter where in the world the Card pieces are, they share a connection.</font>

286
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I can always tell in what direction my mama is!</font>

287
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although you can't tell how far away.</font>

288
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, so mysterious!</font>

289
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And they have lots of them in the New World, right?</font>

290
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quite convenient!</font>

291
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, I'll just sign this piece of my Mama's Vivrecard for you...</font>

292
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you ever run into trouble, just follow this and go see Mama.</font>

293
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And be sure to tell her that I'm doing fine, too.</font>

294
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I've got one of those, too.</font>

295
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just thought of that too.</font>

296
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't this just like that white piece of paper Ace gave you back then?</font>

297
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This piece of paper will allow us to meet again.</i></font>

298
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, that's what he meant...</font>

299
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it is...</font>

300
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's burning, and seems like it's gotten smaller...</font>

301
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you! Let me see that!</font>

302
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, this is certainly a Vivrecard...</font>

303
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I didn't tell you this yet... This paper also reflects the owner's vitality and life force!</font>

304
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This belonged to someone important to you, right?</font>

305
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! It's my brother's!</font>

306
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola?</font>

307
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate to tell you, but this person's life...</font>

308
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is fading!</font>
