92

96
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! You talked just now!</font>

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take it there! Take it there! To the master's lair!</font>

98
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! We dropped it!</font>

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! We broke it!</font>

100
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,250

104
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,870

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,920

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Half-kill!</font>

113
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The samurai... certainly...</font>

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he strike us with the back of the blade?</font>

115
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems it was raining here.</font>

116
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ground is a little wet.</font>

117
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?</font>

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know, but...</font>

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now those squirrels were carrying us to be delivered in that coffin.</font>

120
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't this an iron coffin?!</font>

121
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, those three are awake!</font>

122
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad. Call our comrades!</font>

123
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like... we're currently behind the mansion.</font>

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hogback's laboratory was on the top floor.</font>

125
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've already carried us a long way it seems.</font>

126
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look behind you!</font>

127
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a sturdy building on the opposite side!</font>

128
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was such a huge building behind the mansion all this time?</font>

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've figured out where we are!</font>

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

132
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

133
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're on the passage that connects the mansion to that huge building.</font>

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Passage?</font>

135
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so wide, almost like a forest.</font>

136
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it's been made a forest, they were carrying our coffin here while we were unconscious.</font>

137
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means, they had to have been carrying us to that building.</font>

138
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's probably the place where zombies are made.</font>

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad we woke up!</font>

140
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run!</font>

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! Let's run, right away!</font>

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

143
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't get any treasure because we got scared and started running around screaming...</font>

144
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that alright?</font>

145
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you thinking, idiot?!</font>

146
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My "Something is wrong"-sensor is having a huge response!</font>

147
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just run away, Nami!</font>

148
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! That's right!</font>

149
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I clearly remember what the zombie said back then.</font>

150
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run! Let's run!</font>

151
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What a shame!</i></font>

152
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The treasure storehouse isn't here!</i></font>

153
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop thinking useless stuff, let's run!</font>

154
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run, Nami!</font>

155
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How stupid!</font>

156
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally understand! I was just too scared at the time!</font>

157
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weird looking eyes!</font>

158
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, where do we run?</font>

159
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forward?</font>

160
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back?</font>

161
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one hard decision.</font>

162
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we go back to the mansion, we'll most likely run into that samurai again.</font>

163
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, we might run into scarier guys if we head forward.</font>

164
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're these little animals?</font>

165
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Penguins?</font>

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Numbers!</font>

167
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One!</font>

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two!</font>

169
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three!</font>

170
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Greetings, we're...!</font>

172
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Penguin Zombie Combi-</font>

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I got it wrong.</font>

174
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trio! We're a trio!</font>

175
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the new guy!</font>

176
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like we care about that kinda member info!</font>

177
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And behind you all are...</font>

178
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

179
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our comrades, the Wild Zombies!</font>

180
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome to Perona-sama's Wonder Garden!</font>

181
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More strange creatures came out!</font>

182
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright then, let's get 'em!</font>

183
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

184
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

185
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire?</font>

186
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use fire! These guys are zombies!</font>

187
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly...</font>

188
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

189
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

190
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out, behind you!</font>

191
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp...</font>

192
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper...</font>

193
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in the same situation!</font>

194
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

195
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard! What're you doing to your comrade!</font>

196
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your enemy is that woman!</font>

197
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's the one you should beat!</font>

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea who this lady might be or where she came from...</font>

199
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But even if it goes against master's orders...</font>

200
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I die...</font>

201
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't hurt a woman!</font>

202
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you've a problem with that, bring it on!</font>

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Zombies!</font>

204
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What's wrong?!</font>

205
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Piglet!</font>

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did something again, didn't you?!</font>

207
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spit it out!</font>

208
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you from the start that I don't know anything.</font>

209
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're laughing now.</font>

210
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an obvious fella.</font>

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How strange...</font>

212
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not even a scream.</font>

213
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if they were strangled to death...</font>

214
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is your train of thought always so dark?!</font>

215
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How weird...</font>

216
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Zoro's disappeared.</font>

217
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did they go?!</font>

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be helped with Zoro and Sanji!</font>

219
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing at a time like this?!</font>

220
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! I found the armor lying in there!</font>

221
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it a man's romance to wear it?!</font>

222
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

223
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Romance?!</font>

224
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

225
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you gained that iron body, did you change your heart to iron as well?</font>

226
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please forgive me!</font>

227
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never intended to go so far as to change my heart to iron!</font>

228
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you lose something important, a foreboding wind blows through your heart.</font>

229
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please listen...</font>

230
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"The Heart of a Steely Cyborg Traveler"</font>

231
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are these guys aware of the current situation?</font>

232
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

233
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've come to a large hall.</font>

234
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin, are Usopp and the others there?!</font>

236
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think so.</font>

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This hall's interior looks like the outside...</font>

238
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this place?!</font>

239
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's as if it were an arena.</font>

240
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not that simple.</font>

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better resign yourselves.</font>

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible for you to escape from here!</font>

243
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

244
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?!</font>

245
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A moving suit of armor!</font>

246
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt it's a zombie.</font>

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's moving even with those spears in its body.</font>

248
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just 'cause zombies are well equipped...</font>

249
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't be scared...!</font>

250
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong Right!</font>

251
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wall was...!</font>

252
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since it uses fencing...</font>

253
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons Left!</font>

254
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky was...!</font>

255
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll take more than that to kill me!</font>

256
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Especially for a corpse like you!</font>

257
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still getting up.</font>

258
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The latch won't open.</font>

259
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's completely different from the zombies we've seen so far.</font>

260
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soon you'll understand!</font>

261
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what makes them really terrifying!</font>

262
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy, speaking from that far!</font>

263
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They don't feel pain!</font>

264
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every single one of those armed General Zombies made a name for themselves in battle.</font>

265
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're unbending warriors!</font>

266
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The leader of a country's knights who turned into a brutal criminal.</font>

267
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A legendary samurai, a pirate, a gunslinger!</font>

268
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Imagine those men after they've become invulnerable!</font>

269
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way someone like you could beat them!</font>

270
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even now your friends are in peril!</font>

271
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serves you right!</font>

272
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wall zombie!</font>

274
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

275
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's closed off the path!</font>

276
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not the only path that was closed.</font>

277
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speaking from my experience...</font>

278
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will be more than just tough.</font>

279
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's full of armor!</font>

280
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in fighting them one by one, as our attacks don't harm them.</font>

281
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we'll just be overwhelmed if we try to face them all straight on.</font>

282
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

283
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right, it's not like this is our last battle.</font>

284
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we run straight ahead from this hall, we'll probably reach the courtyard.</font>

285
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Then, the three of us will meet up in there.</font>

286
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful not to let anyone else disappear.</font>

287
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

288
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get 'em!</font>

289
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

290
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move!</font>

291
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Phoenix of the Thirty-six Earthly Desires!</font>

292
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This technique...!</font>

293
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

294
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A scar on the back is a shame for a warrior!</font>

295
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yet I'm covered with scars!</font>

296
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

297
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you were Zoro.</font>

298
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Jigoro!</font>

299
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're exactly like him!</font>

300
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what you use against zombies!</font>

301
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fresh Fire!</font>

302
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare the buckets!</font>

303
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

304
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once Fleur!</font>

305
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Eleven flowers</i></font>

306
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slam!</font>

307
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Luffy?!</font>

308
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems he hasn't come out yet.</font>

309
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we went back, it'd be hard to find that idiot because he's wearing that armor!</font>

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could he have disappeared as well?!</font>

311
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we can't patiently wait for him.</font>

312
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies will be here in no time!</font>

313
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Straw Hat!</font>

314
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurt, bastard! Let me out!</font>

315
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?</font>

316
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Bastards, let me out, damn it!</font>

317
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not fun, damn it!</font>

318
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the lid!</font>

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A coffin?!</font>

320
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out immediately!</font>

321
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out, I'll kick your ass!</font>

322
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice just now...!</font>

323
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out!</font>

324
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I'm telling you to let me out!</font>

325
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

326
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...!</font>

327
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Straw Hat inside of that thing?!</font>

328
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After him, Nico Robin!</font>

329
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is he doing?!</font>

330
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He let himself get caught!</font>

331
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

332
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not following him!</font>

333
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!</font>

334
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the widely rumored Spider Monkey!</font>

335
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A gigantic spider!</font>

336
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This thing's size exceeds that of average insects! It's a monstrous spider!</font>

337
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out I tell you, idiot!</font>

338
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the li-</font>

339
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! Another one.</font>

340
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, the coffin...!</font>

341
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, what're you gonna do with him?!</font>

342
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.</font>

343
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever happens to him, you will also learn firsthand.</font>

344
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be worrying about yourselves...</font>

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before you is me, and behind you are the armored soldiers!</font>

346
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this your crew will be...</font>

347
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Annihilated!</font>
