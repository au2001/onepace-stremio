135
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

136
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sea Kings?!</i></font>

137
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... was that?!</font>

138
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It couldn't just be a coincidence.</font>

139
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi... You couldn't be...</font>

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Captain?</font>

141
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a legend passed down in my family...</font>

142
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:59,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the distant past, there lived a Mermaid Princess
who possessed the sacred power to control Sea Kings!</font>

143
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My forefather Vander Decken traveled to the ocean floor in pursuit of that legend!</font>

144
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Honored forefather!  I have finally found it!</i></font>

145
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi is the legendary Mermaid Princess?!</font>

146
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did it, Captain!</font>

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be bad if anyone else heard about this!</font>

148
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a secret legend, that only my family knows of...</font>

149
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume!</font>

150
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I could freely control the Sea Kings and have them do my bidding,</font>

151
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">everyone would have to do as I told them!</font>

152
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would be able to take whatever I wanted!</font>

153
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what are you going to do?</font>

154
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we going to kidnap Princess Shirahoshi?</font>

155
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, I must become the princess's husband!</font>

156
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaaat?!</i></font>

157
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Princess Shirahoshi is still a kid!</font>

158
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, and therein lies the problem!</font>

159
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aladdin.</font>

160
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will... treat his wounds.</font>

161
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yours as well, Otohime-sama, as soon as I can.</font>

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some weeks later, after the Celestial Dragon's treatment was complete and his life had been saved,</font>

163
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he was about to leave for his homeland...</font>

164
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime made an astonishing move.</font>

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember this!</font>

166
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the tactlessness and rudeness that I, a World Noble, had to endure here...</font>

167
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn fish-creatures!
I swear I will make you regret them!</font>

168
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We saved his life, so why does he resent us?!</font>

169
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our country gave him
the ship and crew to take him home.</font>

170
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can he talk to us like that?</font>

171
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We shouldn't let him leave.
He'll just put the island in even greater danger.</font>

172
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait!</font>

173
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still have some unfinished business, it seems.</font>

174
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That being the case,
I will accompany you to the surface.</font>

175
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the surface?!</font>

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's crazy!  Otohime-sama!</font>

177
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

178
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait -jamon, Otohime!</font>

179
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not allow you to do something so self-centered!</font>

180
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you absolutely must settle things with the Nobles, then I will go!</font>

181
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the king and a great knight,
I'm sure you'd never be captured by the humans...</font>

182
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why it should be me!</font>

183
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.  If someone as strong as you went,
it would be meaningless.</font>

184
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the weak cannot travel there and return safely,</font>

185
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we cannot prove to our citizens that the surface is safe.</font>

186
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is why I, who am weaker than most,</font>

187
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">must go to the surface.</font>

188
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

190
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama!</font>

191
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you going somewhere, Otohime-sama?</font>

192
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime...</font>

193
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Believe...</font>

194
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in the wife you chose, and in the humans.</font>

195
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's merely the queen of
these fish-creatures!  Such conceit!</font>

196
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

197
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

198
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe...</font>

199
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody could have possibly stopped her.</font>

200
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can only believe in her, and wait.</font>

201
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your Majesty!  Please, be safe!</i></font>

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Otohime-sama!</font>

203
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

204
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Ryuuguu Kingdom was enveloped in a cycle of sleepless nights caused by uncertainty.</font>

205
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there was nothing we could do except pray for the Queen's safety.</font>

206
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Japanese folklore object resembling Pandora's Box</i></font>

207
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  The Tamate Box?</font>

208
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, Captain!
Amazingly enough, I hear it's in Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

209
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And anyone that opens the box immediately grows old?</font>

210
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  That's how it works.</font>

211
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, for example,
if a little squirt like this kid were to open it...</font>

212
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she'd become a sexy broad
above the age of consent?</font>

213
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She most certainly would.</font>

214
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!  My problem is solved!</font>

215
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I could quickly marry Princess Shirahoshi...</font>

216
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume!</font>

217
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go steal that Tamate Box immediately!</font>

218
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... wait a second...
Breaking into Ryuuguu Palace ain't so easy.</font>

219
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you marry Shirahoshi first...</font>

220
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then you could come and go as you please.</font>

221
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys sure are smart.</font>

222
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi ain't exactly ugly,</font>

223
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so she should be a good looking broad in ten or twenty years.</font>

224
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she'll be even bigger.</font>

225
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's even better.
I don't have anything against big women!</font>

226
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That girl is the legendary Mermaid Princess who can control Sea Kings.</font>

227
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will become her husband,</font>

228
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and once I've gotten that power, I will finally realize...</font>

229
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the dream that the Vander Decken family has sought after for generations!</font>

230
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, now let's get started on the wedding invitations.</font>

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Proposing comes first!</font>

232
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  I don't have any friends!</font>

233
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Days passed without any news of the Queen.</font>

234
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The uncertainty just grew and grew.</font>

235
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, I even miss her speeches.</font>

236
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, somehow, come back alive.</font>

237
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Boss, where's Otohime-sama?</font>

238
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When's she coming back?</font>

239
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have faith in her and wait.</font>

240
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She set out on this journey for the sake of <i>your</i> future.</font>

241
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness, please be safe.</font>

242
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother...</font>

243
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine -jamon.  Believe in her and wait -jamon.</font>

244
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A week passed, which felt like 100 days.</font>

245
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then...</font>

246
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hooray!  Otohime-sama!</font>

247
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!</font>

248
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just knowing that she's alive... We're so...</font>

249
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome home!</font>

250
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness...</font>

251
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It took several days to persuade them,</font>

252
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but Queen Otohime finally calmed the Celestial Dragons...</font>

253
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the sheet of paper that she brought back...</font>

254
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">could be called the light of hope for Fishman Island.</font>

255
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Attention everyone!
The World Nobles have a lot of political power...</font>

256
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">when it comes to the Council of Kings, and even the World Council.</font>

257
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was written by a World Noble.
Here's what it says:</font>

258
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"For peace and friendship between fishmen and humans,</font>

259
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hereby endorse
the proposal of the attached petition."</font>

260
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, when we submit
all of our signatures to the World Council Meeting,</font>

261
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:08,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by including this single piece of paper we will have actual power.</font>

262
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will definitely be able to emigrate to the surface.</font>

263
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons are backing it?</font>

264
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Politics is complicated.</font>

265
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we have to do
is to collect a large number of signatures...</font>

266
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so the final decision is yours.
I can only wait while you decide.</font>

267
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about it?  Live alongside the humans?</font>

268
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please indicate your desire to emigrate to the surface.</font>

269
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!  Your signatures!</font>

270
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Children, aren't you just trying to make me happy,
only to ask to take them back later?</font>

271
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nope!
Mom said she's gonna submit one, too!</font>

272
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama.  This small box just ain't big enough!</font>

273
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just how many people do you think are in this country?</font>

274
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  Start using this box, please!</font>

275
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put your signatures into this box
to say that you support the Queen's burning dream!</font>

276
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishmen and humans.  We're turning
our eyes away from the history of segregation.</font>

277
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, it was the Queen's decision to take
those first bold steps that gave birth to this hope.</font>

278
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can gather just a few more signatures,</font>

279
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we might really change Fishman Island's future.</font>

280
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he'd been touched
by Queen Otohime's burning conviction,</font>

281
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">even Arlong might have been saved.</font>

282
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish Brother Ti could have seen this...</font>

283
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was at that moment...
when I gained the courage to truly change this island.</font>

284
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That moment?</font>

285
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, the day when the Sea Kings peeked in on Fishman Island.</font>

286
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think everyone was surprised that day.</font>

287
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They came because Shirahoshi called them.</font>

288
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!?</font>

289
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All fishmen are capable of
communicating their feelings to fish,</font>

290
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so we're certainly able to talk to them, right?</font>

291
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But not just anyone can talk to those great Sea Kings.</font>

292
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the only person capable of communicating with whales, your father, Neptune, can't do it.</font>

293
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a legend that is passed down
through the royal family.</font>

294
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every few hundred years, a mermaid will be born with the ability to communicate with Sea Kings.</font>

295
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those humongous Sea Kings?</font>

296
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're talking about Shirahoshi?</font>

297
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  Someday, someone capable of guiding her power to be used for the right purpose will appear,</font>

298
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and this will bring about a great change to the world.  Or so the legends say.</font>

299
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole world?</font>

300
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's true, I'm sure that great changes will occur on this island too.</font>

301
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, maybe that power will assist your efforts?</font>

302
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think so.</font>

303
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to save people, it's a power of love capable of saving thousands of lives.</font>

304
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if a dark-hearted person were to wield it,
they could sink the whole world under the sea.</font>

305
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the most terrifying powers in this world.</font>

306
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She still hasn't realized that she wields this power,</font>

307
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and she can't control it yet.</font>

308
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Shirahoshi experiences another shock, even greater than the one before,</font>

309
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she may unconsciously
send the Sea Kings on a rampage.</font>

310
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happens,
Fishman Island could be turned into rubble!</font>

311
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do?!</font>

312
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it now.
I'll figure something out eventually, so it's fine.</font>

313
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For now, the three of you should concentrate on
growing up and becoming magnificent warriors.</font>

314
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:58,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, as big brothers and as warriors, you must protect your little sister with your life.</font>

315
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand!</font>

316
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

317
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

318
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then the incident happened, without any warning.</font>

319
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back!  They're going up in flames!</font>

320
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did the signature box suddenly catch fire?</font>

321
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Water!  Get water!</font>

322
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly, put the fire out!</font>

323
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could this happen?!</font>

324
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all the effort we went through to collect the signatures!</font>

325
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama's been shot!</font>

326
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who the hell?!</font>

327
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a sniper out there!  Protect the Royal Family!</font>

328
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

329
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

330
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too dangerous here!
Please fall back to the Ryuuguu Gondola.</font>

331
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princes!</font>

332
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!  Your Highness!</font>

333
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama!</font>

334
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Princess, this must be difficult for you...</font>

335
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you!?</font>

336
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!</font>

337
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't approach the Princess!</font>

338
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it right there!</font>

339
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!  Mother!</font>

340
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

341
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  Who the hell did this?!</font>

342
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why aren't the paramedics here yet?!</font>

343
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!  Mother!</font>

344
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open your eyes!</font>

345
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Unforgivable!
I'll destroy whoever is responsible for this!</i></font>

346
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

347
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay by my side, my little angels.  Don't make such scary faces.</font>

348
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was careless.
All those signatures made me so happy.</font>

349
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly happy!</font>

350
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi, I'm the one who is upset...</font>

351
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!  We're ready to treat you!</font>

352
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, whoever the culprit is...</font>

353
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">please don't be angry for me.</font>

354
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:31,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me.</font>

355
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

356
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi.  Control yourself.</font>

357
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If Shirahoshi experiences another shock, greater than the one before...</i></font>

358
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This...</font>

359
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi, no...</font>

360
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Shirahoshi!</font>

361
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Akkamanbo akamanbo!  Akkamanbo akamanbo!</font>

362
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  Shirahoshi!</font>

363
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Akkamanbo akamanbo!</font>

364
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fun!  It's fun!</font>

365
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing to cry about!  Let's sing, Shirahoshi!</font>

366
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three of us will always be here for you -la ti do!</font>

367
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Manbo dancing sure is fun!</font>

368
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So fun!</font>

369
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  Fun -do re mi fa!</font>

370
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are the princes doing?!</font>

371
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop them!</font>

372
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't appropriate!</font>

373
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!  Look!  Look!  It's fine!</font>

374
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll always protect her like this -la ti do!</font>

375
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!
Don't you understand Her Highness's condition?</font>

376
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother.  We'll recollect the burnt signatures.</font>

377
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll become great soldiers like our father.</font>

378
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as we promised,
we'll protect Shirahoshi with our lives!</font>

379
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So please...</font>

380
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please, don't worry!</font>

381
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a hair's breadth away... The light of the real sun.</font>

382
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!  We've found the assassin!</font>

383
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!  Hurry to the roof!</font>

384
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that him?!</font>

385
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the assassin?</font>

386
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san!</font>

387
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just took him down.</font>

388
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was it?</font>

389
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

390
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

391
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a human?!</font>

392
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let anyone know!</font>

393
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Boss Jinbe?</font>

394
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

395
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What would become of all of Her Majesty's efforts?</font>

396
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This would destroy them completely.</font>

397
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that just too much?!</font>

398
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is the harsh reality.</font>

399
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!  He's a pirate!</font>

400
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether or not he's a pirate is irrelevant.</font>

401
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it, Hody!</font>

402
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

403
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, all of you!</font>

404
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human...</font>

405
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">killed our country's queen!</font>

406
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime's killer was human!</font>

407
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could this happen?!</font>

408
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human.</font>

409
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her Majesty kept telling us to live with them...</font>

410
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and moved by her words,</font>

411
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we had decided to walk beside them.</font>

412
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now a human...</font>

413
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has shattered that dream.</font>

414
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's taken the life of the person we all dearly loved!</font>

415
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may be dead, but that doesn't
give us Queen Otohime back, human!</font>

416
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has this world been forsaken by God and Buddha alike?!</font>

417
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is too cruel!</font>

418
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Far too cruel!</font>

419
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is His Majesty still inside Koukaku Tower?</font>

420
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Minister of the Left...</font>

421
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is as you hear.</font>

422
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said that he couldn't control himself.</font>

423
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Lock the door!</i></font>

424
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't open it until my bloodthirst passes!</i></font>

425
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty...</font>

426
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me.</font>

427
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Minister of the Left...</font>

428
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The culprit was still carrying a gun...</font>

429
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so the soldiers shot him down.</font>

430
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a human!</font>

431
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would have killed him even if he was unarmed!</font>

432
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm sure Otohime would
never have forgiven me for that.</font>

433
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know when this cycle of revenge started...</font>

434
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if I had killed him,
I'd have just been sucked into that very cycle.</font>

435
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And any children who saw it...</font>

436
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">would have the seed of hatred planted in their hearts,
so they'd also be dragged in.</font>

437
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The cycle would grow even larger.</font>

438
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In my head, I understand what Otohime told us.</font>

439
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or rather,
I could if this was happening to someone else!</font>

440
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... why can't I kill someone if they kill my wife?!</font>

441
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just don't get it -jamon.</font>

442
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I lived as a warrior
and avenged countless fallen comrades.</font>

443
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Many humans attacked me, and I crushed them.</font>

444
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all that, I didn't think I had the right to help with Otohime's campaign,</font>

445
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I just watched over her instead.</font>

446
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do the innocent die... while I still keep on living?!</font>

447
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:30,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I tried to continue Otohime's work,
I would just look like a hypocrite -jamon.</font>

448
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... peoples' hearts constantly change.
We are all full of contradictions.</font>

449
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both fishmen and humans.</font>

450
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there will always be things
that only a warrior can protect.</font>

451
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

452
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for worrying you.</font>

453
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't miss my own wife's funeral -jamon.</font>

454
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!  Father!</font>

455
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi...</font>

456
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father.</font>

457
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Children...</font>

458
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness.</font>

459
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me... for not being here when you needed me.</font>

460
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, look at this.</font>

461
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

462
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wherever I go, letters keep flying after me.</font>

463
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the fifth one already, Father.</font>

464
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is... a love letter?!</font>

465
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi is still only six years old!</font>

466
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is this Vander Decken?!</font>

467
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's from a family of pirates.</font>

468
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let the children attend the funeral!</font>

469
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The assassin might still have
some allies running around.</font>

470
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And as for this pirate named Decken,
capture him immediately!</font>

471
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

472
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone...</font>

473
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The monitor...</font>

474
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi?</font>

475
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi...</font>

476
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just before she died,
our mother told us with a smile on her face...</font>

477
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that the light of the real sun was just a hair's breadth away.</font>

478
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have decided to dedicate our lives to fulfilling our mother's wish.</font>

479
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princes...</font>

480
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:33,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your hearts may not heal
in time for the World Council Meeting in two years...</font>

481
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's another one in six years.  And yet another in ten years!</font>

482
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure you have conflicted feelings about humans following this incident.</font>

483
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We discarded all the signatures
that hadn't already burned to ash.</font>

484
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's restart from square one!</font>

485
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someday...
when everyone's hearts have had time to heal...</font>

486
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">let us... dream of the sun together!</font>
