<font face="Impress BT" size="37">To whomever took him out,
why don't we reveal</font>

129
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">the terror that comes from defying
this criminal organization?</font>

130
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So this is Little Garden!</font>

131
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's "little" about it?</font>

132
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This place doesn't quite 
fit its cute name.</font>

133
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah! It's like an uncharted island. 
The jungle's so thick!</font>

134
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We'll need to be careful.</font>

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm worried about what 
Miss All-Sunday was saying.</font>

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>But what's even unluckier is 
the course your log pose indicates.</i></font>

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>The name of the next island is...</i></font>

138
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Little Garden.</i></font>

139
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>We'll just sit back and relax,</i></font>

140
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>as you'll be wiped out long before 
you reach Arabasta.</i></font>

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">L-L-Like a monster
might show up?!</font>

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Who knows?</font>

143
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then at this next stop,
let's stay aboard the ship!</font>

144
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Y'know, the log could
take a while to register.</font>

145
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Also, we have to 
stock up on food soon.</font>

146
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We didn't get anything 
from that last town.</font>

147
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's a river over there!</font>

148
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What? Really?</font>

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's find a barbecue restaurant!</font>

150
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">As if there'd be one!</font>

151
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What happened to 
stocking up on food?</font>

152
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We'll collect food to cook later! 
Honestly! You got a screw loose?</font>

153
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But it's dangerous to go ashore.</font>

154
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">For starters, take a look
at these plants.</font>

155
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's nothing like them
in any encyclopedia.</font>

156
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah!</font>

157
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're so cute!</font>

158
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You mean me?</font>

159
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Obviously I meant Nami-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

160
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What in the world is that?!</font>

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's all right. It's just a bird.</font>

162
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And this is just a jungle.
Don't worry.</font>

163
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Right?</font>

164
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's your problem,
you damn bird?!</font>

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A lizard? I wonder
if it tastes good.</font>

166
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Do jungles normally
make that kind of noise?</font>

167
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That sounded like a volcano!</font>

168
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A tiger?!</font>

169
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's way too big!</font>

170
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah!</font>

171
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What...?! What happened to it?!</font>

172
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This isn't normal! 
This is definitely not normal!</font>

173
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why would a tiger, king of the jungle,
collapse in a bloody heap?!</font>

174
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah! It's decided that we're 
<i>not</i> gonna go ashore!</font>

175
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We'll wait quietly on the ship,
and when the log is ready,</font>

176
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">we leave this island immediately.</font>

177
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Right!</font>

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Right!</font>

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">W-We're in a hurry
to get to Arabasta.</font>

180
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"></font>

181
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sanji! Lunch!</font>

182
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lunch?</font>

183
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah! For replenishing energy!</font>

184
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A pirate lunch 
with lots of meat and no veggies!</font>

185
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I smell adventure!</font>

186
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">W-Wait a sec! 
Where are you going?!</font>

187
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Adventure!</font>

188
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wanna come along?
Adventure! Adventure!</font>

189
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's no use. You can't stop him
when he gets this enthusiastic.</font>

190
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No way! Somewhere in here is a 
monster that beats up huge tigers!</font>

191
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sanji! Lunch!</font>

192
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You got it. Coming right up.</font>

193
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Say, do you mind if I come along?</font>

194
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?!</font>

195
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sure! C'mon! C'mon!</font>

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Not you too!</font>

197
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah. If I stay here,</font>

198
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I might begin to brood.</font>

199
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Exploring will distract me 
until the log sets.</font>

200
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No way! Luffy going is one thing,
but it's too risky for you!</font>

201
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll be fine.
I'll have Karoo by my side.</font>

202
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">His face tells
a different story, though.</font>

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then Vivi-<i>chan</i> gets 
a sweetheart lunch.</font>

204
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Could you also prepare
a drink for Karoo?</font>

205
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Of course! Leave it to me!</font>

206
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Okay.</font>

207
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Two "pirate lunches" and a special 
drink for Karoo. You're all set.</font>

208
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Okay!</font>

209
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, then. See you later!</font>

210
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All right! Let's go!</font>

211
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We'll be back in a little while!</font>

212
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Miss Wednesday sure is brave.</font>

213
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">As expected from someone who
 infiltrated an enemy organization.</font>

214
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, I'm bored too.
I'm going for a walk.</font>

215
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A walk?!</font>

216
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"></font>

217
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah! Hey, Zoro!</font>

218
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wait!</font>

219
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm?</font>

220
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We're short on food.</font>

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If you see an animal that
looks edible, bring it back.</font>

222
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Okay, got it.</font>

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll find one that even
you couldn't possibly capture.</font>

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hold it right there!</font>

225
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?!</font>

226
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I can't just let that challenge slide!</font>

227
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So you think you can nab
a bigger one than me?</font>

228
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Of course!</font>

229
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're on, then!</font>

230
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Look! The winner brings back 
the most kilograms of meat.</font>

231
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't you mean to say tons?</font>

232
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Save the attitude for when
you've brought something back.</font>

233
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sounds fair to me!</font>

234
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I wonder. Why do they
all turn out this way?</font>

235
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I know how you feel.</font>

236
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No need to cry.
I'm with you on this.</font>

237
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm screwed.</font>

238
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! That's my line!</font>

239
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But wait a sec.</font>

240
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wh-Wh-What's the matter?!</font>

241
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">N-N-N-N-Nami?!</font>

242
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This isn't it. This isn't it, either.</font>

243
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ouch! Ow, ow! H-Hey, Nami! Nami!</font>

244
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! What the heck 
are you looking for?</font>

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I remember reading 
about it in a book.</font>

246
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A-About what?</font>

247
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Little Garden.</font>

248
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whoa!</font>

249
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What is it?</font>

250
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Here, look at this! There's a shellfish, 
but it's like a squid.</font>

251
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A squid shellfish!</font>

252
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It looks a lot like an ammonite.</font>

253
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, a squid shellfish?</font>

254
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why do I get the feeling
I'm being followed?</font>

255
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just my imagination.</font>

256
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't screw with me!</font>

257
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Collier Shoot!</font>

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hmm.</font>

259
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What the hell is this? 
Is it edible?</font>

260
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let me see. Which one was it?</font>

261
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I think I read it recently, 
but it slipped my mind.</font>

262
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey. Why is there
a sea king on land?</font>

263
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A dinosaur!</font>

264
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A dinosaur?!</font>

265
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then, this is a prehistoric island!</font>

266
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

267
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This island hasn't progressed
past the time of the dinosaurs!</font>

268
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm?</font>

269
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Trade and culture exchange
on the Grand Line is very rare,</font>

270
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">due to the harshness 
of sea travel here.</font>

271
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Thus, each island establishes 
its own unique culture.</font>

272
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Some islands have
become incredibly advanced,</font>

273
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and there are others 
that remain unchanged,</font>

274
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">their progress halted for thousands,
no, <i>tens</i> of thousands of years.</font>

275
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's all thanks to the
Grand Line's nonsensical climate.</font>

276
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That is why this island is stuck
in the age of the dinosaurs.</font>

277
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Amazing!</font>

278
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't leap to it!</font>

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Usopp! Usopp!</font>

280
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What? What's the matter?</font>

281
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Did you find the book?</font>

282
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah.</font>

283
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is bad. On this island...</font>

284
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">– Ahh!
– Ahh!</font>

285
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What? It felt like Nami-<i>san</i>
just called out to me.</font>

286
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i><i>To those residing here, this island
is naught but a little garden.</i></i></font>

287
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i><i>Little Garden...</i></i></font>

288
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i><i>is what I shall name this place.</i></i></font>

289
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i><i>Louis Arnote, Explorer.</i></i></font>

290
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So?</font>

291
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,510
<font face="Roboto" size="26"><font color="#000000">Brogy the Giant</font></font>

292
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,510
<font face="Roboto" size="26">Brogy the Giant</font>

293
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What do you say?</font>

294
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wh-What was that? 
C-Could you repeat that?</font>

295
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I asked if you have any booze.</font>

296
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We don't have much left.</font>

297
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So then, you <i>do</i> have some!</font>

298
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wh-What we have isn't for drinking, just cooking and disinfecting.</font>

299
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But if you'd like, you can have it all.</font>

300
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dino...</font>

301
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dinosaur?</font>

302
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm Brogy, Elbaf's strongest warrior!</font>

303
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now I've got meat. 
Allow me to treat you as my guests.</font>

304
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">H-Hey.</font>

305
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">P-Pretend we're dead, 
no matter what happens.</font>

306
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">D-Doesn't pretending to be dead 
only work on bears?</font>

307
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whoa! What a great view!</font>

308
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I wanna have my lunch up here.</font>

309
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is <i>not</i> the time for idle chatter!</font>

310
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah! Oh? So there really <i>are</i> volcanoes.</font>

311
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And there's a mountain 
with huge holes as well.</font>

312
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah!</font>

313
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He's been eaten!</font>

314
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Where am I?</font>

315
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whoa!</font>

316
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,730
<font face="Roboto" size="26"><font color="#000000">Dorry the Giant</font></font>

318
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I was watching.</font>

319
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Grappling longnecks in the jungle...</font>

320
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a lively human!</font>

321
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're my first guest in a long time.</font>

322
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're huge! Are you a human?</font>

323
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm Dorry, Elbaf's strongest warrior!</font>

324
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A-A giant!</font>

325
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I've heard of them, but this is my 
first time actually seeing one.</font>

326
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm Luffy. I'm a pirate.</font>

327
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A pirate?! Good for you!</font>

328
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo! Wake up!</font>

329
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's run while we can!</font>

330
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh yeah, those two over there are 
Vivi and Karoo. Nice to meet you!</font>

331
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san</i> just <i>had</i> 
to open his big mouth!</font>

332
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let me invite you to my place!</font>

333
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:53,320
<font face="Roboto" size="26">Home of Brogy the Giant</font>

334
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now, eat! Dinosaur meat is tasty.</font>

335
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I-I'm not hungry.</font>

336
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't hold back!</font>

337
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't want to eat.</font>

338
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But dinosaur meat is real tasty, 
I'm tellin' ya.</font>

339
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Is he gonna make us 
eat the dinosaur meat...</font>

340
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">...just to fatten us up a bit...</font>

341
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">...and then eat <i>us<font size="10"> </font></i></font>?

342
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yup. This is textbook giant, all right.</font>

343
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But we're still so young.</font>

344
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Maybe we're at peak flavor.</font>

345
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a waste.</font>

346
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's good, I'm tellin' ya.</font>

347
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If we manage to fast and stay thin 
until the log registers,</font>

348
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">we might survive.</font>

349
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But how long will it take 
for the log to finish?</font>

350
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After a three-day fast, I'll succumb 
to this meat's amazing aroma.</font>

351
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! 
Can I ask you a question?

352
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm? What is it, little miss?</font>

353
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">H-How long will it take 
for this island's log to register?</font>

354
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">One year.</font>

355
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?!</font>

356
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh no... There's no way 
we can fast for a year.</font>

357
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I definitely won't keep from eating.</font>

358
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, make yourselves at home!</font>

359
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,720
<font face="Roboto" size="26">Home of Dorry the Giant</font>

360
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is yummy, giant old guy!</font>

361
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That "pirate lunch" of yours was, too,
though it was a little small for me.</font>

362
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You bet it's good!</font>

363
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's a special lunch the chef 
on my pirate ship made.</font>

364
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Badmouth it, and I beat you up.</font>

365
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Beat me up, you say?</font>

366
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're a riot, kid!</font>

367
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Th-They're becoming awfully friendly.</font>

368
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">By the way, why are you 
living here alone, old guy?</font>

369
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Isn't there a village or something?</font>

370
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm? There <i>is</i> a village. 
It's a warriors' village called Elbaf.</font>

371
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's elsewhere in the Grand Line.</font>

372
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm?</font>

373
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But there are rules in the village.</font>

374
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Rules?</font>

375
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">For example, if a fight breaks out,
and neither party concedes,</font>

376
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">the gods of Elbaf intercede 
with their judgment.</font>

377
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Elbaf's gods favor one party 
with divine protection in battle,</font>

378
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and thus the victor is deemed correct.</font>

379
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hmm. Elbaf's gods, huh?</font>

380
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I once started such a fight,</font>

381
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and now this island hosts a duel
between another man and me.</font>

382
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">One of us will survive,
so that man will be correct.</font>

383
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But even after 100 years,
the matter still isn't settled!</font>

384
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You guys've been fighting for 100 years?!</font>

385
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No surprise there. Our lifespan is 
at least three times as long as yours.</font>

386
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Three times or otherwise,</font>

387
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">wouldn't the fighting 
wind down after 100 years?</font>

388
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why would you 
carry on for so long?!</font>

389
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's a duel to the death, right?!</font>

390
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's a huge eruption!</font>

391
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, time to go.</font>

392
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

393
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's that?</font>

394
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">An eruption.</font>

395
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

396
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He suddenly got so serious.</font>

397
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sorry, I have to head out for a bit.</font>

398
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What? Head out?</font>

399
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes. That was the signal for me
to continue my 100-year duel.</font>

400
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A duel?</font>

401
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">With whom? Where?! 
And for what reason?!</font>

402
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Reason? I don't remember.</font>

403
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Before we realized it,
it had become routine.</font>

404
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">When the central mountain erupts,
it's signaling for the duel.</font>

405
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?!</font>

406
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Locked in a death match for 
100 years, and with such hatred...</font>

407
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What in the world caused this fight?!</font>

408
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Stop it.</font>

409
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's not like that.</font>

410
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Right. It's a matter of pride!</font>

411
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I forgot...</font>

412
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">the reason a long time ago!</font>
