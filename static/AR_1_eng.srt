rampage throughout the Grand Line!</font>

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Y'know, somewhere on
the Grand Line, there's supposedly</font>

75
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">a place called Fishman Island
teeming with gorgeous mermaids!</font>

78

81
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you know why the Grand Line
is called the Pirate Graveyard?</font>

82
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well, there are three
great powers governing it.</font>

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One of which is the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>

84
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Seven Warlords?</font>

85
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Basically, they're privateers.</font>

86
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Are you kidding?</font>

87
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why would pirates receive
government approval?</font>

88
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're allowed to roam free because
the government receives a cut</font>

89
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">of what they plunder
from other pirates.</font>

90
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">To other pirates, they're no more
than government dogs,</font>

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but they're incredibly strong!</font>

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Counted among them is the man
who defeated Zoro, Hawk Eye Mihawk!</font>

93
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's just crazy!</font>

94
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There are seven guys like <i>him</i>?!</font>

95
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The Seven Warlords sound crazy!</font>

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well, one of the Seven Warlords
is Jinbe, boss of the Fishman Pirates.</font>

97
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He and Arlong stood
side by side as equals,</font>

98
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">committing atrocity after
atrocity in the Grand Line.</font>

99
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Like this?</font>

100

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's just your last
picture standing up!</font>

101
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Arlong has subjugated twenty towns
since coming to the East Blue!</font>

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He makes Don Krieg look like nothing!</font>

103
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But why would Nami go
after this guy on her own?</font>

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I told you, she must want
the bounty on his head!</font>

105

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">"Captain Usopp's Grand Adventure"!</font>

246
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There! There!</font>

247
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Fishmen!</font>

248
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Fishmen!</font>

249
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Full speed ahead!</font>

250
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, sir!</font>

251
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why did you just pass by it?!</font>

252
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Did you see that?!
There were fishmen there!</font>

253
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's Arlong's crew! They're scary!
Got a problem with that?!</font>

254
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't you snap at me!</font>

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Looks like this whole area

256
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What now?</font>

257
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright! We'll just say we
couldn't bring Nami back!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Time to go!</font>

262
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Agreed!</font>

263
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,060

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! At least untie me!</font>

266
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wait, what? Just one guy?</font>

267
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Are you some kinda
castaway or somethin'?</font>

268
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I-I guess...</font>

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm gonna kill those guys!</font>

270
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Ah! So you got these wounds
from being tortured!</font>

271
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright, let's take him
to Captain Arlong!</font>

272
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Forgive us, Zoro!</font>

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll tell Luffy you died honorably!</font>

274
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What rotten luck!</font>

275
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll never forget you, Big Bro!</font>

276
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright, then! Let's get
on dry land for now!</font>

277
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right!</font>

278
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There should be a town
called Gosa up here!</font>

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wh-What happened here?!</font>

280
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I heard Arlong trashed it
a few weeks back, but...</font>

281
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Th-The houses have all
been flipped upside down!</font>

282
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's said that fishmen are naturally
ten times stronger than humans...!</font>

283
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is this what people from
the Grand Line are capable of?</font>

284
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How'd the street even get like this?</font>

285
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A monster called Momoo did it.</font>

286
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A monster?</font>

287
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They have monsters, too?</font>

288
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We brought him all the way
from the Grand Line.</font>

289
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">From the Grand Line, huh?</font>

290
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wait, <i>we</i>...?!</font>

291
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're with that castaway, right?!</font>

292
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Bye-bye!</font>

293
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82" color="#d6d6d6">Get back here!</font>

294
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82" color="#d6d6d6">No way!</font>

295
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,470

371
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm so angry! But I'll endure it!</font>

372
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What about your mom?</font>

373
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's alive...</font>

374
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's worried about you.</font>

375
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Go back to her.</font>

376
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your tattoos are scary,
but you're not half-bad!</font>

377
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How closed-minded!</font>

378
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I don't know anything
about you, you know.</font>

379
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, right!</font>

380
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">My name is Captain Usopp!</font>

381
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm looking for a girl named Nami...</font>

382
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! Nami's an officer
of the Arlong Pirates?!</font>

383
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yep.</font>

384
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Everyone here knows about her.</font>

385
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's the "witch"
that little boy mentioned.</font>

386
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Funnily enough, that witch
grew up in this very house.</font>

387
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami and I are adopted sisters.</font>

388
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So this is...</font>

389
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami's house?</font>

390
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami and I are both orphans.</font>

391
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We were brought up in this house.</font>

392
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Our foster parent is dead,</font>

393
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but the three of us used to live
happily here in Cocoyashi Village.</font>

394
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So, Nami betrayed
her own parent and village</font>

395
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and joined Arlong's crew?!</font>

396
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, pretty much.</font>

397
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A real witch, huh?</font>

398
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit! So that's the deal?!</font>

399
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She had us fooled the whole time!</font>

400
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She was after treasure
from the very start!</font>

401
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even after she helped fight
to protect my village</font>

402
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and looked so happy sailing with us!</font>

403
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh? She looked happy?</font>

404
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Her?</font>

405
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We came here to
bring her back with us,</font>

406
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but I guess there's no need for–</font>

407
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That reminds me, a friend of ours
was unfortunately caught by the fishmen.</font>

408
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is bad...</font>

409
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I wonder how he's holding up.</font>

410
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Open the gate!</font>

411
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We've brought someone suspicious!</font>

412
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll ask again.</font>

413
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just why have you come here?</font>

414
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I told you already—I'm looking
for a girl, you half-fish freak!</font>

415
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've got a big mouth
for a lowly human.</font>

416
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll excuse you this time,
but never say "half-fish" again.</font>

417
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We fishmen are evolved humans
who've gained the ability</font>

418
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">to breathe underwater.</font>

419
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Our fish-like qualities
make us superior to you.</font>

420
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Such traits are the proof
we've evolved far beyond you!</font>

421
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get it through your head that
fishmen are the lords of all things!</font>

422
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Humans defying fishmen is basically
defying the laws of nature!</font>

423
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm sick of your
ridiculous dogma, Arlong.</font>

424
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't be like that, Nami.</font>

425
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You may be human,
but you're an exception.</font>

426
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're a skilled cartographer and a
prized member of the Arlong Pirates!</font>

427
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your sea charts are second to none!</font>

428
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm much smarter than you morons.</font>

429
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's only natural.</font>

430
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, Nami!</font>

431
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What does he mean, “cartographer”?!</font>

432
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why are you acting all
buddy-buddy with this guy?!</font>

433
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh? He's an acquaintance of yours?</font>

434
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

435
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He was another mark.</font>

436
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I just swiped a whole load
of treasure from this guy.</font>

437
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I can't believe he'd follow me here
without any idea he'd been tricked.</font>

438
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How naive.</font>

439
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So these are your true colors, huh?</font>

440
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">After all that talk about hating pirates.</font>

441
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Surprised?</font>

442
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It was all an act.</font>

443
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Does this clear things up?</font>

444
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Th-That's...</font>

445
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm a pirate, plain and simple!</font>

446
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">An officer of the Arlong Pirates!</font>

447
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Boy, she sure had you fooled!</font>

448
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This girl is a cold-blooded witch;</font>

449
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">she'll even overlook the death
of her own parent for money!</font>

450
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well...</font>

451
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">just chalk it up to bad luck that
you crossed her and give up.</font>

452
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I see.</font>

453
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Though, it's not like I ever
trusted her to begin with.</font>

454
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even if she were a mass murderer,
I wouldn't be too surprised.</font>

455
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In that case, can't you just get lost?!
I'm sick of looking at you!</font>

456
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What happened?! Why'd he
suddenly jump into the water?!</font>

457
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is this some kind of trick?!</font>

458
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, it's not like he slipped or anything...</font>

459
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Then he ran away!</font>

460
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, his arms and legs are tied!
He can't swim like that!</font>

461
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's suicide.</font>

462
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Leave him be.</font>

463
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That idiot!</font>

464
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's back.</font>

465
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! What's going on, Nami?!</font>

466
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What were you thinking?!</font>

467
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, what were <i>you</i> thinking?</font>

468
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're just a little girl who
can't even watch one guy die...</font>

469
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Stop trying to act cool!</font>

470
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Save me sooner next time, idiot!
I thought I was gonna drown!</font>

471
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Screw you!</font>

472
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Mess with me again and I'll kill you!</font>

473
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I wonder.</font>

474
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're covered in bandages.</font>

475
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I didn't have a change of clothes,
so I used these instead.</font>

476
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, Nami.</font>

477
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What should we do with him?</font>

478
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Lock him up!</font>

479
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll deal with him myself!</font>

480
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Captain Arlong! Captain Arlong!</font>

481
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What is it, brother?</font>

482
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm sorry!</font>

483
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That guy had a long-nosed
friend with him, but he got away!</font>

484
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What the hell, Usopp?!</font>

485
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You wound up getting
spotted anyway?!</font>

486
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I think...</font>

487
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">he might've escaped into
Cocoyashi Village...</font>

488
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Cocoyashi Village, huh?</font>

489
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Perfect.</font>

490
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I have some business there, too.</font>

491
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,040
<font face="Chinacat" size="99"><b><font face="DFPGiHi-W7-Strp"><font color="#000000">Cocoyashi Village</font></font></b></font>

493
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! Arlong's coming!</font>

494
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

495
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What for?!</font>

496
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We just paid our tribute!</font>

497
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's probably about my
weapons they discovered.</font>

498
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Return to your houses, everyone.</font>

499

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Mr. Gen...!</font>

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're here!</font>

501
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So you're the bastard...</font>

502
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">who was in possession of weapons.</font>

503
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, that's correct.</font>

504
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I've always loved collecting weapons.</font>

505
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,120
<font face="Chinacat" size="99"><b><font face="DFPGiHi-W7-Strp"><font color="#000000">Genzo
Cocoyashi Village</font></font></b></font>

506
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,120
<font face="Chinacat" size="99"><b><font face="DFPGiHi-W7-Strp"><font color="#faf9fa">Genzo
Cocoyashi Village</font></font></b></font>

507
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Are collections forbidden
under your rule, as well?</font>

508
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, I can't allow that.</font>

509
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Weapons breed nothing but
evil thoughts and violence.</font>

510
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're the primary cause
of disturbing the peace.</font>

511
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's huge! <i>That's</i> Arlong?!</font>

512
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-He's not human!</font>

513
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right. Because he's a fishman.</font>

514
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, right.</font>

515
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I control twenty towns and villages.</font>

516
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">As their overseer,
I can't afford to have rebellions.</font>

517
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I destroyed the great port town of Gosa
as an example to the other communities!</font>

518
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Being unable to pay tribute</font>

519
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">is an act of rebellion against us!</font>

520
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey!</font>

521
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Pay tribute?</font>

522
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Exactly as it sounds.</font>

523
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's money that we offer to them.</font>

524
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Every month, we buy
our lives with money.</font>

525
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Adults and children...</font>

526
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If anyone in a village can't
pay the tribute money...</font>

527
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">even if it's just one person...</font>

528
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">the village will get
annihilated just like Gosa.</font>

529
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Then that huge town was destroyed
just because of one person?!</font>

530
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's how Arlong governs.</font>

531
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're speciesists that don't
give a damn about killing humans.</font>

532
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Listen up.</font>

533
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Puny humans shouldn't worry about
anything except continuing to pay up!</font>

534
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I need vast sums of capital!</font>

535
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your tribute money will eventually
become the cornerstone</font>

536
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">of the Arlong Empire,
which will rule the East Blue!</font>

537
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A-Arlong Empire?!</font>

538
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're planning to turn the entire
East Blue into a fishman empire?!</font>

539
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get out of here.</font>

540
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Before Arlong comes back.</font>
