1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Government calls me a pirate who hates pirates...</font>

2
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But your group is a different matter.</font>

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Hates pirates"? You do?</font>

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose you would be surprised...</font>

5
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I spent a lot of time on Whitebeard's ship, but...</font>

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of my status, I had to travel underwater to get there.</font>

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do like you guys, after all.</font>

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I seem to recall that you almost killed me once, though...</font>

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you almost killed me too, didn't you?</font>

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I simply wanted to help him...</font>

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, Fishman Island is at peace, only because of old Whitebeard.</font>

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All pirates who travel the Grand Line pass through Fishman Island...</font>

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shortly after the Great Pirate Era began, Fishman Island was thrown into chaos.</font>

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was flooded with too many human pirates for us to hold back...</font>

15
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As well as the marines chasing after them.</font>

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Countless mermaids and fishmen were kidnapped and sold,</font>

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and just as everyone had closed their eyes against the despair...</font>

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard appeared.</font>

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This island belongs to me now!</i></font>

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those words were all it took!</font>

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that, nobody was able to lay a hand on Fishman Island.</font>

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such power!</font>

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never forget that day!</font>

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And like that he protected countless islands by claiming them as his own.</font>

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the pirate boss, so we can't let him fall!</font>

26
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think would happen to the oceans if he were to die?!</font>

27
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The era of chaos would resume.</font>

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone should be able to understand that!</font>

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Government must have realized this too!</font>

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to stop this fight, even if it cost me my life.</font>

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to save you, Ace-san...</font>

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei... please stop.</font>

33
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're being too hard on yourself...</font>

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I still haven't abandoned hope.</font>

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have faith in miracles and chance.</font>

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like things have gotten pretty interesting out there.</font>

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This sounds like a perfect chance to take down Whitebeard...</font>

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The thought of it makes my blood boil.</font>

39
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you!</font>

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're saying you want to take the old man's head?</font>

41
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't the only one.</font>

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill Whitebeard!</font>

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard's gonna die, you say?!</font>

44
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, I like that! Sounds great!</font>

45
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out to sea!</font>

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be the one to take his head!</font>

47
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me fight too!</font>

48
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll bring an end to the era of Whitebeard!</font>

49
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be silent, fools!</font>

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei. Fire Fist.</font>

51
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember this well.</font>

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try and count those who were forced to swallow their tears after being unable to beat Whitebeard or Roger...</font>

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you'll find thousands and thousands of 'em across the sea.</font>

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That explains why we couldn't contact them...</font>

55
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The surveillance room on Level 2 has been crushed by the basilisk!</font>

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They beat the basilisk?!</font>

57
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are those two?!</font>

58
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on in Level 2?!</font>

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone there!</font>

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've found them?</font>

61
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, but...</font>

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like there are three of them now.</font>

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
<font face="Roboto" size="39">The Demonic Beast Floor</font>

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bara Bara...</font>

67
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle...</font>

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!
Cannon!
Lock!</font>

69
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That giant centipede exploded!</font>

70
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was made up of several puzzle scorpions!</font>

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're poisonous!</font>

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just keep on coming!</font>

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See, I told you so.</font>

74
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were completely fooled by my "Fake Legs Master-Plan"!</font>

75
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just blew our cover!</font>

76
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

77
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and I heard that the boss of the beasts in Level Two was some sort of lion-like thing...</font>

78
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it those guys?</font>

79
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Those are lions with human faces, manticores!</font>

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even our bones?!</font>

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keys...</font>

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, give us the keys...</font>

85
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ignore them!</font>

86
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are simply able to imitate human speech because their faces are human-like!</font>

87
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, help!</font>

88
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts... It's so painful...!</font>

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are only imitating what they've heard the prisoners say. They don't even know what it means!</font>

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Creepy...</font>

93
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just repeating dumb stuff!</font>

95
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't react!</font>

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you!</font>

97
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said you'd lend us a hand, right?</font>

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I did!</font>

99
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, we should combine our resources to escape from here, should we not?!</font>

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do I get further down?</font>

101
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm headed for Level 3!</font>

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? You don't intend to escape?!</font>

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you not climbing up to Level 1?!</font>

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat plans to free his brother, Ace.</font>

105
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Brother?!</font>

106
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, you and Fire Fist Ace are siblings?!</font>

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're going to rescue him?!</font>

108
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in a hurry!</font>

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that Ace-guy is being kept here, he must be in Level 5.</font>

110
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're going to a place like that...</font>

111
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking around!</font>

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be insane!</font>

113
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting out of here!</font>

114
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

115
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, could you at least tell me where the stairs are?</font>

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stairs...?</font>

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stairs to Level 1 also continue down to Level 3!</font>

119
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can use Straw Hat to distract the beast guarding the stairs!</font>

120
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that is where he and I will part.</font>

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, Straw Hat. Let us go on together!</font>

122
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me, Straw Hat!</font>

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me...</font>

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something here...</font>

125

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Handsome men!</font>

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Ikemen: Handsome man</i></font>

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You called?</font>

140
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy's dangerous!</font>

141
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this...?</font>

142
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sphinx is running wild off in the distance!</font>

143
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way in hell we'd be able to escape from here!</font>

144
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Korean black soy noodles!</font>

145
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, how strong <i>is</i> that thing?!</font>

146
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, isn't it his fault we wound up here anyway?</font>

147
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was thinking the same thing.</font>

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Then, our "Escape Alliance" is hereby formed!</font>

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure am glad there is someone here who genuinely values freedom!</font>

150
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, let's commence our "Straw-Hat-is-Our-Decoy-Plan"!</font>

151
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what're you guys doing?</font>

152
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Here it comes, Straw Hat!</font>

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber Bazooka!</font>

154
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you upset it on purpose?!</font>

155
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh crap!</font>

156
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two are so unfair!</font>

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Escaping up to the high ground like that!</font>

158
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pulled noodles!</font>

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fell for it, you simple-minded creature!</font>

160
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is a wax-statue I created using my candle powers!</font>

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Steamboat noodles...</font>

162
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't have Miss Goldenweek's brilliant coloring...</font>

163
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it is quite sufficient to fool a beast such as yourself!</font>

164
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one is authentic?</font>

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

166
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

167
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

168
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool! It's a game of Whack-a-mole!</font>

169
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

170
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

171
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

172
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

173
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it wrong. How about that one?</font>

174
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

175
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!</font>

176
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's playing around with the Sphinx!</font>

177
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, how carefree can you get?!</font>

178
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in on it too, huh?</font>

179
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're enjoying this more than I thought they would... Well, now's my chance!</font>

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's up with these strange tremors?</font>

181
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long are they gonna keep upsetting the Sphinx?</font>

182
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

183
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can this floor even withstand all this?</font>

184
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Level 3!</font>

185
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've lost contact with several monitors! We're hearing some really loud noises from above!</font>

186
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mr. 3! Now's our chance!</font>

187
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like the operation was a success!</font>

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was nothing like what I planned!</font>

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, let's run!</font>

190
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the door to the stairs?</font>

191
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make a key out of wax!</font>

192
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the monitoring room!</font>

193
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still can't get any response from Level 2!</font>

194
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no idea what's going on!</font>

195
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That stupid monster!</font>

196
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's caused the entire floor to crack!</font>

197
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Level 3!</font>

198
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A monster is falling through the ceiling!</font>

199
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! That's Level 3 below us, ya know!</font>

201
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry noodles!</font>

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monitor room! We are at the scene on Level 2.</font>

203
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Can you see the image?</i></font>

204
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Keep us updated!</font>

205
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Roger that!</i></font>

206
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened here?!</font>

207
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This hole is big enough for even
the Sphinx to fall through!</font>

208
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does Straw Hat Luffy want?</font>

209
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! This is bad!</font>

210
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners on Level 2 are all
free! How did they get the keys?!</font>

211
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they responsible for this too?!</font>

212
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guards are in trouble!</font>

213
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hear it for Captain Buggy!</font>

214
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our savior!</font>

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Level 2 reporting! We need backup pronto!</font>

216
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners are...</font>

217
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">rioting!</font>

218
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send Blugoris to Level 2!</font>

219
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've just received word of Straw Hat Luffy's intent!</font>

220
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did?! From whom?!</font>

221
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleet Admiral Sengoku at the Headquarters sent word!</font>

222
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The invader - Monkey D. Luffy and the condemned prisoner - Portgas D. Ace,</font>

223
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">those two are brothers!</font>

224
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then he came here to rescue "Fire Fist" Ace before the public execution?!</font>

226
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, there's no doubt!</font>

227
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That explains why he keeps going down!</font>

228
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were focused on Whitebeard's attack!</font>

229
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he pulls this off, the
tide will turn against us!</font>

230
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inform Warden Magellan at once!</font>

231
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And get the riot on Level 2 under control!</font>

232
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,630
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="120"><font color="#141417">Navy</font></font></font>

233
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's so funny, Garp?!</font>

234
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're standing at a crossroads that could change the world,</font>

235
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he keeps causing problems one after another!</font>

236
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At Enies Lobby...</font>

237
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the time with the Celestial Dragons...</font>

238
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of this has been unprecedented!</font>

239
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And this time he's meddling with a prison where no-one's escaped for 20 years!</font>

240
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since the abhorrent Golden Lion, a prison which has never been breached...</font>

241
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">known for so long as a robust and iron-tight great fortress - Impel Down!</font>

242
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has disgraced its name by being the first to penetrate its walls!</font>

243
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could he be your grandson, Garp?!</font>

244
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He sure has accomplished a lot! I'm proud of my grandson!</font>

245
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Bartholomew Kuma!</font>

246
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said that he took care of the
Straw Hats at Sabaody Archipelago!</font>

247
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew that he was lying!</font>

248
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You weren't going to trust the word of a Shichibukai, were you?</font>

249
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway I wonder how he got through the Navy's impregnable defenses...</font>

250
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he flew in?</font>

251
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut the crap! If you weren't known as the hero of the Navy,</font>

252
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would have made you take full responsibility for your family, Garp!</font>

253
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can take this old man's life but the situation is far more serious than that!</font>

254
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not funny!</font>

255
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This has all been the Navy's blundering!</font>

256
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you realize how much Tsuru and I worked to deal with the aftermath?!</font>

257
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that's mine! Give it back!</font>

258
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

259
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

260
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow ow ow...</font>

261
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow ow ow! This floor is like a frying pan!</font>

262
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we in the desert?! It's so hot!</font>

263
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is it so quiet?</font>

264
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level 3! Oh I never wanted to come here!</font>

265
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! I'm doomed along with you again!</font>

266
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Looks like the lion's taking a cat nap!</font>

267
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is especially difficult for me and my wax powers.</font>

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's just go.</font>

269
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! Grilled chicken is served!</font>

270
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

271
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a hummingbird that fluttered down from upstairs and got grilled in the air.</font>

272
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How hot is it in here?!</font>

273
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, can we just get in...</font>

274
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it a miserable sight?</font>

275
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prisoners on this floor were once all tough criminals with over 50,000,000 belly bounties.</font>

276
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heat from the Burning Heat Hell underneath...</font>

277
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">along with depriving them of food and water has made them half dead.</font>

278
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Level 3 - the Starvation Hell!</font>

279
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you know why this floor is covered with sand.</font>

280
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Odds are the sand beneath us
are remains of a prisoner who dried up.</font>

281
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay here too long, we will become like them before we know it.</font>

282
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to get away from here while we still have sweat to spare.</font>

283
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's hurry down to Level 4!</font>

284
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

285
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, not that way! We gotta take the stairs on the left.</font>

286
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah?</font>

287
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, we should take the pass on the right.</font>

288
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one is it?!</font>

289
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why...</font>

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...are we back where we started from?!</font>

291
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope we make it to Level 4 soon.</font>

292
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We told you, we're not going!</font>

293
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to guide me!</font>

294
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said that we were gonna save Ace together!</font>

295
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We never said that!</font>

296
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop imagining things as you want them to be!</font>

297
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you say you would?</font>

298
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are in!</font>

299
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, draw the net!</font>

300
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir!</font>

301
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going on my own, then!</font>

302
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

303
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

304
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! It's a trap! They got us already!</font>

305
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's made of iron!</font>

306
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't use my Bara Bara Fruit power!</font>

307
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it contains Sea Prism Stone!</font>

308
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gonna torture us for attempting to break out.</font>

309
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're goners.</font>

310
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The invader Straw Hat Luffy has been captured, along with two others!</font>

311
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean "two others?!"</font>

312
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't antagonize them Buggy-kun!</font>

313
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over.</font>

314
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! I gotta rip this net!</font>

315
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are guards and Blugoris here!</font>

316
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put the Sea Prism Stone handcuffs on them!</font>

317
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger!</font>

318
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Damn! Damn!</font>

319
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

320
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Saru-desu: I'm a monkey.</i></font>

321
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Saldeath.</font>

322
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, really? But you don't look like one.</font>

323
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

324
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not listening.</font>

325
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Saldeath.</font>

326
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huuh, really?</font>

327
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Get it right! It's my name!</font>

328
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give up.</font>

329
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,660
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Chief Guard
Saldeath</font>

330
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,660
<font face="Roboto" size="39">(Blugori Commander)</font>

331
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It's no use holding out.</font>

332
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}There's no place to get away in this isolated underwater prison!</font>

333
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's lucky you were caught by me.</font>

334
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because there are four demon guards prowling around on the floors beyond this.</font>

335
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

336
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right! I don't wanna face them and the warden!</font>

337
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vongole bianco!</font>

338
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Chief!</font>

339
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soup spaghetti!</font>

340
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's onto pasta now!</font>

341
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna get squashed!</font>

342
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spaghetti!</font>

343
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sphinx is awake!</font>

344
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, he's gonna break the net!</font>

345
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let those three, especially Straw Hat, get away!</font>

346
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deep-fried noodles!</font>

347
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's back on noodles again!</font>

348
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must've been going through a phase!</font>

349
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay!</font>

350
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great! Now we can run!</font>

351
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them!</font>

352
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

353
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

354
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Where did those two go?</font>

355
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, Mr. 3!</font>

356
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't move quickly due to this heat...</font>

357
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! They climbed up the net!</font>

358
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

359
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you see Ace tell him that I said "Hello" and
"Let's have a drink if I ever see you again alive!"</font>

360
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be a good little live bait for us, stupid!</font>

361
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was happy to see you were alright but... Alright! See ya!</font>

362
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for helping me!</font>

363
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ugh! How sweet!</font>

364
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch! It's heartbreaking!</font>

365
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay sharp! He is a pirate with a 300,000,000 belly bounty!</font>

366
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now is our chance to run!</font>

367
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

368
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time to fight you all!</font>

369
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buckwheat noodles!</font>

370
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! He's still around!</font>

371
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

372
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gonna run! Chase him!</font>

373
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are the stairs to go down?!</font>

374
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hot...</font>

375
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be safe here! They're after Straw Hat as we wished.</font>

376
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They closed up the staircase going up.</font>

377
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's already too much for me to stay here.</font>

378
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Un deux faint!</font>

379
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,960

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Un deux faint!</font>

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Who's singing?</font>

382
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Un deux come on!</font>

383
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Un deux faint!</font>

384
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Un deux come on!</font>

385
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know this world is about a man and a woman!</font>

386
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when you're an okama you're a little of both!</font>

387
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why we're the greatest!</font>

388
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The greatest!</font>

389
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The greatest!</font>

390
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The greatest!</font>

391
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The okama way is the greatest!</font>

392
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The greatest!</font>

397
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are doing great!</font>

398
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I spin and spin like I'm caught up in the tide of the times!</font>

399
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way!</font>

400
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Listen to me! That's...</font>

401
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys! You can't be that tired!</font>

402
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This stifling heat is nothing!</font>

403
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can be even more stifling!</font>

404
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! If it isn't Mr. 3!</font>

405
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as I thought. It's you...</font>

406
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Mr. 3?!</font>

407
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey wait a minute! Why're you here?!</font>

408
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're behind bars so you've been caught?!</font>

409
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No no. The one who has been caught is me!</font>

410
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so surprised I had to do a double take with an "Okama Way" Kenpo called...</font>

411
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looking Back on that Autumn Night's Dream!</font>

412
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What kind of creature is this?!</font>

413
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's be sure not to let him out.</font>

414
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?! Let me out!</font>

415
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did he slip through our tight security?!</font>

416
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's just one invader.</font>

417
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if Ace were to be rescued, Impel Down, as well as
the World Government, would be humiliated!</font>

418
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna get into that prison,</font>

419
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and in the name of Navy Headquarters, we must catch Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

420
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

421
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Who are you?!</font>

422
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Sadie-chan who loves torturing people!</font>

423
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,850
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down
Security Chief</font>

424
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:33,850
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Sadie-chan</font>

425
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}After being breached by an intruder taking Navy help,</font>

426
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}would only further disgrace Impel Down's name!</font>

427
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She can't be serious, using "chan" to refer to herself...</font>

428
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

429
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better call me "Sadie-chan!"</font>

430
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't resist those screams!</font>

431
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you!</font>

432
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it! Are you saying that you don't need our help?</font>

433
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. This prison is a labyrinthine hell.</font>

434
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't know it well, you can't help us!</font>

435
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd appreciate your help if you just guard the outside.</font>

436
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll raise this drawbridge which is the only entrance to the prison...</font>

437
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...and seal off Impel Down completely!</font>

438
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. There is no way out...</font>

439
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...of this underwater prison!</font>

440
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, then we'll guard the outside.</font>

441
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that's a good boy.</font>

442
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A koala?</font>

443
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding me!</font>

444
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A koala.</font>

445
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A koala?</font>

446
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A koala.</font>

447
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impel Down is now completely sealed off!</font>

448
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal?!</font>

449
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan's here too. What's going on?</font>

450
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have a special visitor, Ace!</font>

451
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess who's here!</font>

452
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe! Even you have never met her before,</font>

453
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so there's no way that Ace can guess who it is.</font>

454
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's well-known but never shows herself! She leads the Kuja - the tribe of warriors!</font>

455
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's one of the Royal Shichibukai!</font>

456
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong, noble, and the most beautiful woman in the world!</font>

457
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She is the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!</font>

458
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah yeah, Hancock! Hancock-sama!</font>

459
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yo, goddess! When I become warden, will you marry me?!</font>

460
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!</font>

461
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch! I really wanna become the warden!</font>

462
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I got it wrong. I mean it really hurts to be hit by the warden!</font>

463
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

464
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! For real?! She is so beautiful!</font>

465
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So she's the Snake Princess of the Kuja? Hey, turn around!</font>

466
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Hancock-chan!</font>

467
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Look how sexy she is!</font>

468
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Young lady! Come to our cell!</font>

469
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">We will love you tenderly!</font>

470
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">What a good smell! I wanna visit the Maiden Island!</font>

471
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">There's only women and everybody's naked there right?</font>

472
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want from me?</font>

473
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing. I just wanted to take a look at you.</font>

474
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because you will become the cause of the war that I will take part in.</font>

475
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm worth a look then?</font>

476
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Boa Hancock! Are you ignoring us?!</font>

477
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Come here!</font>

478
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've always been an empress with a strong will who never obeyed any summonses...</font>

479
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're taking part in this war?</font>

480
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Suddenly you value your title of Shichibukai?!</font>

481
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're Jinbe. Don't snarl at me.</font>

482
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yo yo, young lady! Young lady!</font>

483
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're talking! Shut your mouths!</font>

484
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up Magellan, you round-the-clock diarrhea man!</font>

485
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's right!</font>

486
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Snake Princess!</font>

487
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet the girls on the Maiden Island are hungry for us guys!</font>

488
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you! Give me your post as warden!</font>

489
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice Warden.</font>

490
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

491
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She turned!</font>

492
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You keep taunting me with those coarse voices...</font>

493
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared!</font>

494
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh god! I can't resist!</font>

495
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How cute she is! Let us have her, Diarrhea Man!</font>

496
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the vilest place in the world! It makes me sick!</font>

497
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners call you "Diarrhea Man."
How can you stand it, Warden?</font>

498
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must've crushed any pride you take in your job...</font>

499
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! She's irresistible!</font>

500
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shame on you, Diarrhea Man!</font>

501
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

502
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me have her, Diarrhea Man!</font>

503
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diarrhea Man! Let me have Hancock!</font>

504
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm infuriated at their rudeness!</font>

505
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-! Warden, w-w-wait!</font>

506
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's gonna harm us too! No!</font>

507
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gotten carried away!</font>

508
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ugh! Oh man!</font>

509
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to show you...</font>

510
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who is boss in this prison!</font>

511
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!</font>

512
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop, Magellan!</font>

513
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool! We were just joking! Don't!</font>

514
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard... He seriously did it!</font>

515
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That's it! You're gonna die!</font>

516
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need... I need an antidote! Shit!</font>

517
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never forget that I have the authority and the ability to execute each and every one of you at my whim!</font>

518
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:30,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right, Hancock-dono. You can talk freely now.</font>

519
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm done.</font>

520
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is what you just told me true?!</font>

521
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would I lie to you?</font>

522
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah.</font>

523
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was worried that you might get mad.</font>

524
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you done already?</font>

525
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What were they talking about?</font>

526
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beats me. I was trying really hard to get away from you.</font>

527
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-san.</font>

528
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did she just tell you?</font>

529
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She said that my brother's here!</font>

530
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! The one with a straw hat that you always talk about?!</font>

531
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's insane!</font>

532
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah? I didn't notice, but I'm climbing now! I wanna go down!</font>

533
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,840
