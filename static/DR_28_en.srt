101
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo won't let any information out of the country.</font>

102
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why he enclosed the island in the Birdcage.</font>

103
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means right now Dressrosa is...</font>

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only way to get out of this island alive is to move forward and kill Doflamingo.</font>

107
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are a variety of troubles in this country...</font>

108
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So many unexpected things are happening around him</font>

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it seems Doflamingo is enjoying it.</font>

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know anyone who's more cunning than Doflamingo.</font>

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo is a notch above all the others on all fronts but he made just one mistake!</font>

112
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He brought in all those odd, tough warriors from all over the world for the event at the Colosseum.</font>

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not gonna be defeated!</font>

114
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because, after all, I will take down Doflamingo!</font>

115
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?!
I said I'm gonna kick Mingo's ass!</font>

116
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said it would be me, Straw Hat-ya!</font>

117
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm very impressed, but I'm gonna do it!</font>

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier! You said you wanna kill one of the Executives!</font>

119
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a personal thing!
Taking back King Riku's country is my inevitable duty!</font>

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to put an end to the tragedy that started 10 years ago!</font>

121
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you talk about time, I have a grudge from 13 years ago!</font>

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, mine's from 30 years ago!</font>

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lie! There's no way that you're older than me!</font>

124
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, get off!</font>

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get off!</font>

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The road's ending!</font>

127
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost there! The third level!</font>

128
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!
Go straight to the fourth level like this!</font>

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Horse!</font>

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those giant dolls?!</font>

219
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you stop me?!</font>

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that sign!</font>

221
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It says "Keep out"! We can't go in!</font>

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! You should've told me earlier!</font>

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't slow down now!</font>

226
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It means you're not allowed to go in without permission!</font>

227
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry...</font>

228
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one's in here! Is it just storage?</font>

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our savior, a Big Human - Fraland!</font>

268
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Big Human?!</font>

269
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of person is Princess Mansherry?</font>

270
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Mansherry is...</font>

271
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fools!</font>

272
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you pay no notice to me for such a long time!</font>

273
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The factory</font>

274
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is</font>

275
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">my life!</font>

276
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the factory manager.
I'm the most powerful figure in this factory!</font>

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Cyborg Franky of the Straw Hats, aren't you?</font>

278
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a One-star criminal.
How did you make it this far alive?</font>

279
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do to Pink-sama?</font>

280
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That fool?</font>

281
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I won't let you do as you like in this factory!</font>

282
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna take your life!</font>

283
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out! Run, Fraland!</font>

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fraland hugged the factory manager!</font>

285
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, what's going on?!
What are you doing?! Let go of me!</font>

286
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Fraland fall in love with her?!</font>

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That cyborg idiot, how dare he fool me!</font>

288
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no troubled old granny anywhere.</font>

289
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'm relieved to know that.</font>

290
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! So hard-boiled!</font>

291
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor Pink! I'm ready! Bring it on anytime!</font>

292
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop messing with
the morals in the factory!</font>

293
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard has been throwing me around with suplexes!</font>

294
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was he trying to dig up a hot spring or something
with the back of my head?!</font>

295
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?!</font>

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Drop dead!</font>

297
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cat-Ear Punch!</font>

298
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky Southland Suplex!</font>

299
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! The manager is...</font>

300
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurt, you jerk!
How could you use my head like a hammer?!</font>

301
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you treat me so cruelly!</font>

302
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the factory manager!
I'm the most powerful figure here!</font>

303
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once she gets mad, nobody can stop her!</font>

304
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please run, Fraland!</font>

305
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cut up your body and suck your guts up with my vacuum then pound them into pieces!</font>

306
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you cry like a baby, you...</font>

307
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fraland kissed the factory manager!</font>

308
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He kissed...</font>

309
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy just stole a kiss from me...</font>

310
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, get up, you swimming idiot!</font>

311
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey!</font>

312
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute! What are you thinking?!</font>

313
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you do that?!</font>

314
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Be a man about it and become my boyfriend!</font>

315
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool!</font>

316
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The manager just became a bit more feminine...</font>

317
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't blame him, factory manager.</font>

318
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

319
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got involved. It's your fault.</font>

320
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pink-sama! But...</font>

321
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You cut in to a fight between grown men.</font>

322
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When a woman does that, how else can we seal her mouth?</font>

323
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Getting upset over a kiss or two makes you just an immature little tramp.</font>

324
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So don't talk about love or relationships or that sort of stuff!</font>

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

326
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Love with a little chick like that...</font>

327
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Would drive me nuts!</font>

328
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So hard-boiled!</font>

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor! Franky!</font>

330
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How hard-boiled you two are!</font>

331
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you destroy the factory!</font>

332
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prove it with your fists! If you're a man!</font>

333
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna start! The men's fight!</font>

334
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diaper Bombs!</font>

335
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nipple Light Special!</font>

336
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:56,900
<font face="impress bt" size="45">In front of the royal palace plateau
Pica statue</font>

337
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you giving up on hiding in the stone?</font>

338
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you let Rebecca and the others get away!</font>

339
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!
I couldn't have done it without you.</font>

340
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think shitheads like you guys can escape this country!</font>

341
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're almost there at the second level!
Be careful where you land!</font>

342
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring... Clank.</font>

343
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, this is Leo.</font>

344
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Mouji!</font>

345
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mouji! I'm glad to hear from you!</font>

346
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means our friends have been released!</font>

347
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Leo, we have a big problem...</font>

348
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

349
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The princess is...
Princess Mansherry is...</font>

350
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...nowhere to be found in the factory!</font>

351
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

352
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poor dear...</font>

353
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must be locked up somewhere and crying "Mouji! Mouji!"</font>

354
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

355
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get to the old King's Plateau!</font>

356
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!!</font>

357
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Catch King Riku and God Usopp!</font>

358
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,290

359
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No need to be afraid.
They can't climb up here that easily...</font>

360
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill God Usopp!</font>

361
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father-sama, I just got a call from the Tontattas in the factory!</font>

362
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, are they alright?!</font>

363
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

364
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they told me they can't find Princess Mansherry anywhere.</font>

365
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

366
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you guys talking about?!</font>

367
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone in this country is looking for us!</font>

368
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run now!</font>

369
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you gonna go when everyone in this country is looking for you?</font>

370
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be fine.</font>

371
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They know the truth about the past.</font>

372
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not gonna harm Father-sama.</font>

373
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about me?</font>

374
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they're hiding Princess Mansherry elsewhere, it must be in the Palace.</font>

375
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must be somewhere.
Search every nook and cranny.</font>

376
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think Doflamingo has killed Mansherry.</font>

377
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know he needs her ability.</font>

378
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though we need that ability more than him now...</font>
