80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now I've got someone

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next to reach Laugh Tale... will be us!</font>

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my dear Pudding!
I was just talking about you.</font>

84
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up?
Has your third eye finally revealed its power?</font>

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, Mama!
You ask me that every time you see me!</font>

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a half-blood, remember?</font>

87
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no guarantee
that I'll ever be able to use that ability.</font>

88
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

89
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you do have the blood

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't awaken
your latent ability as a three-eye,</font>

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you'll be nothing but a creepy girl.</font>

94
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

95
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that we know each other...</font>

96
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">must be kept secret!</font>

97
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's that skeleton man.</font>

98
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't expect to see him here.
Well, at least they caught him.</font>

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, Mama? I don't feel comfortable talking
to you in here. Can we go to your room?</font>

100
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, of course! Anything for you.</font>

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cock-a-doodle-doo!</font>

102
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,120

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's about to evolve into his third form!</font>

104
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's turning into Count Niwatori!</font>

105
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,380

106
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll finish him off now.</font>

107
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,500

and now it's Count Niwatori!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Note:

110

111
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ate the Egg-Egg Fruit!</font>

112
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Count Niwatori is a true knight!
You should be terrified!</font>

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once he transforms fully,
he'll have power that you'll be no match for!</font>

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop him from disrupting the transformation!</font>

115
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not going to just sit around and watch.</font>

116
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,950

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine, I'll stop.</font>

118
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,580

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that was close!
You could've been killed, Pedro!</font>

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so reckless!</font>

130
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pedro, you really startled me there.</font>

131
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You startled me more.</font>

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, Pedro!</i></font>

133
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Imagine if you were in my position, and a mirror spoke to you.</font>

134
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you managed to come up with a plan
without a second thought!</font>

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just what I expected from you, Pedro!</font>

136
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, we're inside of the mirrors?</font>

137
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is pretty outlandish.</font>

138
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one can come in or get out of here
without Brûlée. We'll be safe here!</font>

139
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we find Sanji,
we can escape through here with him!</font>

140
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell us what you've learned!</font>

141
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

142
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy and Nami got caught?!</font>

143
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's what I heard.</font>

144
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried about Brook too.</font>

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hope he managed to get a copy of that poneglyph.</font>

146
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all in danger! Let's hurry up!</font>

147
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carrot! Did you finish drawing everyone's portrait?</font>

148
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes I did, Chobro!</font>

149
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did?! Good job!</font>

150
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, let's show the portraits to the mirrors in order to get their locations.</font>

151
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

152
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mirror, mirror!
Tell us where these people are!</font>

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They look nothing like them!</font>

154
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That girl with the long hair just ran past me!</font>

155
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mirror talked!</font>

156
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? So, did Nami break out? 
Is she with Luffy?</font>

157
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was with Boss Jinbe!</font>

158
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">J... Jinbe?</font>

159
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-What?!</font>

160
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

161
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,670
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45"><font color="#000000">Third Floor

163
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me if you're here!</font>

164
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop, Straw Hat!</font>

165
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

166
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

167
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got something to tell you!
Where are you?!</font>

168
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta hear me out!</font>

169
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow...</font>

170
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did Straw Hat go?</font>

171
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's too fast! Which way did he go?</font>

172
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he go in here?</font>

173
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The door won't open!</font>

174
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go that way!</font>

175
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Yeah!</font>

176
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're... Sanji's sister!</font>

177
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's correct.</font>

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want? I'm in a hurry here!</font>

179
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're looking for Sanji, aren't you?
You just missed him.</font>

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Really?!
Where'd he go?!</font>

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding lied to us!</font>

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding—who Sanji thinks he's marrying—
told me that she's gonna kill him!</font>

183
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay? Did you get hurt?</font>

184
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for asking. I'm fine.</font>

185
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, my brother
already knows about Pudding.</font>

186
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Has he known the whole time?!</font>

187
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just found out about her.</font>

188
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I tried to convince him to escape from this island,</font>

189
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he was worried about the hostages in the East Blue...</font>

190
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and your crew as well.</font>

191
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hostages? Do you mean the people at the Baratie?</font>

192
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know them too. If they're really in any danger,
I'll go back to the East Blue and fight to protect them!</font>

193
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you want to eat something?</font>

194
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, I'll be fine!</font>

195
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll be here waiting!</i></font>

196
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you don't come back, I'll be here...</i></font>

197
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>starving to death!</i></font>

198
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're the cook of my ship!</i></font>

199
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I won't eat anything other than what you cook!</i></font>

200
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... this is good.</font>

201
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji knows about Pudding.</font>

202
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as he's not being tricked, I'm happy.</font>

203
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've done everything else I can!</font>

204
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, thank you, Sanji's sister!</font>

205
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Why are you going that way?!</font>

206
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't where I promised to meet him!</font>

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

208
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>...want us to chop his head off.</i></font>

209
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You are a sacrifice, Sanji.</i></font>

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As long as you don't try to run away,
everything will work out just fine, Sanji.</i></font>

211
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>At the wedding tomorrow...</i></font>

212
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>the entire Vinsmoke family...</i></font>

213
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>will be executed!</i></font>

214
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Begone from my sight, 
you miserable, lowlife pirate!</i></font>

215
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too late for me to turn back, Luffy.</font>

216
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Something hit my house!</font>

217
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My house!</font>

218
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on? It's so late.</font>

219
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that a person?</font>

220
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! Are you okay?</font>

221
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We found you.</font>

222
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gotta get there as soon as possible.</font>

223
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll be here waiting!</i></font>

224
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've gotta be waiting...</font>

225
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">at that spot!</font>

226
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Block off the exits!</font>

227
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no! We're about to be surrounded.</font>

228
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Isn't there a way out?</font>

229
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you handle the rear, Nami?</font>

230
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can count on me!
I'm getting tired of this.</font>

231
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There they are!</font>

232
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

233
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

234
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are annoying!</font>

235
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thundercloud Rod!</font>

236
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Chopper!</font>

237
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

238
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper! Why are you here?!</font>

239
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Chobro!</font>

240
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carrot!</font>

241
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami! We're here to save you!</font>

242
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see! I'm so sorry!</font>

243
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no!
There are more enemies up ahead.</font>

244
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami! Get in the mirror now!</font>

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

246
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, ow, ow!</font>

247
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter, Prometheus?</font>

248
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,950
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="40"><font color="#000000">Queen's Chamber

250
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wound I got from Soul King is deeper than I thought,</font>

251
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and now it's starting to hurt again!</font>

252
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How pathetic!</font>

253
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, we should give him some credit.</font>

254
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because no one's ever been able to hurt you guys before.</font>

255
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama, are you really going to keep holding onto that skeleton?</font>

256
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? "That skeleton"?
Pudding-<i>san</i>, how could you refer to me like that?</font>

257
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, of course!</font>

258
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Too close!</font>

259
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no other creature like this!
It's a work of soul art!</font>

260
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather carry him around for a while
instead of putting him in a book.</font>

261
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

262
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job on tricking the Straw Hats.</font>

263
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never expected them to get
through the Seducing Woods.</font>

264
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now they're trapped
in a book in the Prisoner Library.</font>

265
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I went to see them, too.
It serves them right.</font>

266
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"It serves them right"?</font>

267
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you gonna kill them?</font>

268
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, after the wedding ceremony.</font>

269
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sent barmaids over to Germa.</font>

270
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're probably in a drunken stupor right now
and won't be expecting anything!</font>

271
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good... But Reiju was investigating me.</font>

272
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's a pretty sharp person.
It's a good thing I took care of her.</font>

273
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? You didn't kill her, right?!</font>

274
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, Mama! Don't you trust me?!
I just shot her leg!</font>

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shot her once, and then erased her memories.</font>

276
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe this.</font>

277
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding-<i>san<font size="12"> </font></i></font>?
Aren't you a sweet girl?

278
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to be careful.
You're my precious bride.</font>

279
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be a major problem
if she tried to get revenge.</font>

280
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for your concern, Mama.
But...</font>

281
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">thanks to her,
I got to test out this gun.</font>

282
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this gun, even Germa's modified bodies
won't stand a chance.</font>

283
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great, very great.</font>

284
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a smart girl.</font>

285
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you open fire tomorrow,
that'll be the signal for our plan to begin.</font>

286
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait.</font>

287
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone will be watching
when it's time for the wedding kiss.</font>

288
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That dopey-faced Sanji will lift
your veil and try to kiss you.</font>

289
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's when...</font>

290
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he'll see your third eye for the first time!</font>

291
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that moment, he'll see his beautiful bride's creepy face,</font>

292
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he'll be distracted for a moment!</font>

293
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'll be your cue, okay?
You'll have to finish him off with one shot.</font>

294
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aim right between his eyes!
Right here.</font>

295
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding-<i>san</i> is going to kill Sanji-<i>san<font size="12"> </font></i></font>?!

296
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone will be in shock, unable to move.</font>

297
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people of Germa will realize
they're in danger and try to run,</font>

298
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it'll already be too late at that point!</font>

299
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As the unarmed Vinsmokes turn around to run,
they'll notice a wall of guns pointing at them!</font>

300
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They won't even have time
to show fear before their blood spills.</font>

301
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunshots will be going off like fireworks!</font>

302
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rain of bullets will continue to pierce their bodies,
even long after they die!</font>

303
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There'll be a giant pool of blood
spreading on the ground!</font>

304
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The six Vinsmokes will be nothing
but mutiliated corpses!</font>

305
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gunshots will be shots of joy!</font>

306
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that's when the real party begins!</font>

307
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll celebrate with the cake.
We'll toast with tea!</font>

308
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once they lose their useless leader,</font>

309
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all of Germa will belong to me!</font>

310
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,800
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45"><font color="#000000">Mirro-world</font></font></font>

311
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,800
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45">Mirro-world</font></font>

312
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay, Chobro?</font>

313
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it!
We're inside the mirror?!</font>

314
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe! Why are you with these rats?!</font>

315
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brûlée.</font>

316
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is obviously treason.</font>

317
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard you tried to leave our crew,
but when faced with the roulette, you cowered in fear!</font>

318
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to repay Mama for protecting
Fishman Island after Whitebeard's death.</font>

319
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since I wanted to leave,
I wanted to do so honorably for her sake.</font>

320
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I could only sense
death and malice from that roulette.</font>

321
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A roulette?</font>

322
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You made the correct choice
not to spin it, Jinbe, Knight of the Sea.</font>

323
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:22,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five years ago, my partner turned that roulette wheel
and asked Big Mom for mercy,</font>

324
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he lost his life instead.</font>

325
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those that spin that thing are guaranteed to die.
It was made that way.</font>

326
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's rigged?!</font>

327
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it is, you fools!
Mama would never let anyone leave alive!</font>

328
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether it's a minor intruder</font>

329
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or an affiliated pirate
who was once loyal!</font>

330
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She welcomes all who come to this land</font>

331
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and kills those who leave!</font>

332
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Mama's–</font>

333
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time for this!</font>

334
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's keep moving!
We need to find Brook, Luffy, and Sanji!</font>

335
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not moving again!
There's too many of you!</font>

336
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,200
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Sanji's Room</font></font></font>

337
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,200
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Sanji's Room</font></font>

338
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. Prince Sanji, the groom,
is fast asleep in his room.</font>

339
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't let him out or let anyone in until morning.
Keep a close eye on that door.</i></font>

340
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, ma'am!</font>

341
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no! I fell asleep-<i>nasu<font size="12"> </font></i></font>!
In Prince Sanji's bed!

342
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he not back yet-<i>nasu<font size="14"> </font></i></font>?

343
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess he won't come back
any time soon-<i>nasu</i>.</font>

344
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I might as well sleep a little more-<i>nasu</i>.</font>

345
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words,</font>

346
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:01,850
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Meeting Room</font></font></font>

347
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:01,850
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Meeting Room</font></font>

348
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms was with them up until Choclat Town.</font>

349
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're trying to get Sanji back.</font>

350
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There were six of them when Pudding
lured them to the main island.</font>

351
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama has Soul King now.</font>

352
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch this!</font>

353
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Pedro was in the courtyard on the third floor
when he blew himself up, right?</font>

354
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed-<i>cock-a-doo</i>.</font>

355
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's two taken care of.</font>

356
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And of the four who entered the Seducing Woods...
the rabbit and raccoon dog...</font>

357
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were caught by Big Sis Brûlée.
She informed us of this earlier today.</font>

358
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means we've taken care of four of the six.
That leaves...</font>

359
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the two who defeated Big Brother Cracker
and escaped from the Seducing Woods.</font>

360
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were definitely imprisoned
in the underground Prisoner Library.</font>

361
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So why are we getting reports
that they escaped?</font>

362
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only one of us was there
in the Prisoner Library.</font>

363
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened, Big Brother Opera?
What's this about Jinbe showing up?</font>

364
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a lie!
Don't make me repeat myself!</font>

365
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In fact, where is he now?</font>

366
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody has reported a thing!
Nobody came down to the basement!</font>

367
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As Mama ordered, I was trying to get
Lola's whereabouts out of them!</font>

368
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They didn't know anything,
so I burned them alive!</font>

369
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know I went a little overboard.</font>

370
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Don't you trust your older brother, Mont d'Or?!</font>

371
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I do.</font>

372
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way I can admit
that I let them get away! Never ever!</font>

373
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama will take away my lifespan
if she finds out!</font>

374
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about Sanji and the Vinsmokes?</font>

375
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're in their rooms.</font>

376
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, then everything is fine!</font>

377
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the intruders have been caught!</font>

378
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, in the great kitchen,
they're preparing the feast for tomorrow!</font>

379
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's make tomorrow the greatest wedding ever
for our precious little sister, Pudding!</font>

380
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

381
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cover more ground and continue
