before he lands a single hit?</font>

140
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's like a fishman!  Amazing!</font>

this thing barely even qualifies as a monster.</font>

159
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  There's something there!</font>

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shark?</font>

162
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shark?</font>

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that shark wearing clothes?</font>

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a pretty big shark.</font>

165
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

166
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've been sucked into the downflow!</font>

167
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap, after them!</font>

168
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to stay together!</font>

169
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I don't wanna die here!</i></font>

170
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,190

171
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?  That guy's still here?</font>

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why are you so calm?!</i></font>

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My eyes are spinning!  Though I have no eyes.</font>

174
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep the yard level!  Steer the ship to the left!</font>

175
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to crash into the continental shelf!</font>

176
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

177
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're not careful, the ship will be destroyed!</font>

178
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaat?!</i></font>

179
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get thrown off!</font>

180
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring the ship to the center of the current!</font>

181
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going so fast!</font>

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp.</font>

183
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, that hurts.</font>

184
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm still alive?</font>

185
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?  Why the long faces?</font>

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I swear, you really are helpless without me.</font>

187
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so cold here!</font>

188
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't find Luffy and the others.  It looks like we got separated.</font>

189
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

190
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just hope they haven't been
torn to pieces by a sea monster.</font>

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your imagination is too scary.</font>

192
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, we won't find them in this darkness,
no matter how hard we look.</font>

193
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not like the darkness...
Do any of you feel like we're being watched?</font>

194
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're probably at least
7 kilometers down by now.</font>

195
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this depth, the pressure would even flatten the Shark Submerge like a pancake.</font>

196
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we near Fishman Island?</font>

197
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe they're already there?</font>

198
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think Caimie-chan said
it's 10 kilometers beneath the surface.</font>

199
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still have to dive another 3 kilometers?!</font>

200
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're only protected by those small soap bubbles.</font>

201
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if they're still alive, they'll run out of air soon!</font>

202
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is why I told them to keep the lifelines attached!</font>

203
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crying about it won't get us anywhere.</font>

204
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's look for them.  I have a light function installed.</font>

205
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

206
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you mean your eyes?!</font>

207
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky...</font>

208
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nipple Light!</font>

209
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you install lights there?!</font>

210
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,600
<font face="impress bt" size="45">These are the deepwater levels. Where the light cannot reach, and ordinary creatures cannot hope to survive.</font>

211
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,420
<font face="impress bt" size="45">A true ocean "Underworld".</font>

212
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out of here!</font>

213
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  Zoro!  Sanji!</font>

214
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you go?</font>

215
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

216
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The range of the Sunny Eyes
isn't all that long to begin with.</font>

217
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How disheartening.</font>

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This darkness makes it even more depressing.</font>

219
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't getting us anywhere.</font>

220
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do?</font>

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't slow the ship down,
so make sure you don't miss anything.</font>

222
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A jellyfish!  There's a huge jellyfish above us!</font>

223
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's huge!</font>

224
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really is massive!</font>

225
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's sparkling!  It looks like a starry night sky!</font>

226
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its hand entered!</font>

227
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Does it want to be friends with me?</font>

228
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't touch it, Chopper!</font>

229
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's probably poisonous!</font>

230
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

231
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not good!</font>

232
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Small Coup De Burst!</font>

233
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!</i></font>

234
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The jellyfish was eaten!</font>

235
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship seems to have lost some air.</font>

236
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's better than being eaten, isn't it?</font>

237
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Coup de Burst is a weapon that uses large amounts of air.</font>

238
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, we're underwater.  Our air is limited!</font>

239
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we shoot air out, the soap bubble shrinks!</font>

240
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The fish that attacked the jellyfish went belly up!</i></font>

241
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neurotoxin, as I suspected.</font>

242
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The deep sea is so scary!  And dark.</font>

243
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there are so many fish
with white eyes.  They're creepy!</font>

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The deep sea is a world of darkness.  Thus,
the eyes of many creatures here have degenerated.</font>

245
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so they can't see very well?</font>

246
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid!  Try to come over here!</font>

247
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  How can I see with no eyes, you ask?</font>

248
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the other hand,
some creatures will have highly evolved eyes.</font>

249
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The answer is...</font>

250
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a secret!</font>

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing over there, all by yourself?</font>

252
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No need to worry.  I am quite used to solitude.</font>

253
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, Zoro, Sanji!</font>

254
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you go?</font>

255
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

256
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These ropes...</font>

257
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone?</font>

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

259
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know what happened to that pirate fellow?</font>

260
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, he was here too.</font>

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd completely forgotten.</font>

262
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did he go?</font>

263
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't seen him since we reached the deep sea.</font>

264
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he got thrown off in the downflow?</font>

265
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That could be.
His hands and legs were bound, after all.</font>

266
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He couldn't hold on to anything.</font>

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you see...</font>

268
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems his ropes came off.  Look.</font>

269
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Then he's still onboard?</font>

270
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where could he be?!</font>

271
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could be lurking inside the ship somewhere.</font>

272
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want me to lurk around then maybe I should.</font>

273
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like in the ladies' quarters?</font>

274
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn... So we can't even
drop our guard on our ship?</font>

275
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.  He's not all that strong, anyway.</font>

276
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great!</font>

277
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The monster trio who fought the Kraken
have gone missing!</font>

278
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're dead for sure after getting lost down here in such small bubbles!</font>

279
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame I couldn't take Straw Hat's head, but...</font>

280
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as long as I collect
the heads of everyone on this ship,</font>

281
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that should be more than enough proof
that Straw Hat is dead!</font>

282
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, don't be hasty, Caribou!</font>

283
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't act too quickly!</font>

284
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you kill them now there will be nobody to sail the ship.</font>

285
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys are skilled at navigating the sea.</font>

286
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the moment when we reach Fishman Island...</font>

287
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will be their last!</font>

288
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he is!</font>

289
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

290
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we'll be safe.</font>

291
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I screwed up!</font>

292
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did he get inside this small barrel?</font>

293
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were careless.  We might have been in trouble
if this guy wasn't such an idiot.</font>

294
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His body lost its form and became a muddy substance.</font>

295
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a devil fruit user, no doubt about it.</font>

296
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's more, he's a Logia.</font>

297
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took our attacks on purpose earlier, and pretended he'd been captured.</font>

298
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  Please let me out, master!</i></font>

299
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Master with the speedo!  I'll be your servant!</i></font>

300
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Chopper?</font>

301
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know, it got really hot all of a sudden.</font>

302
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't handle heat.</font>

303
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So hot!  What's going on?!</font>

304
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, what's this?  Smoke?</font>

305
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's blocking our view!</font>

306
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoke from the ocean floor?  How?</font>

307
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

308
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be?!</font>

309
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydrothermal deposits!</font>

310
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

311
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a field of underwater volcanoes!</font>

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  You can see that they were recently active.</font>

313
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to get out of here!</font>

314
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If one of them erupts, we'll die instantly!</font>

315
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot... so hot!</font>

316
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's coming after us!</font>

317
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A carnivorous tube worm!</font>

318
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Faceless crabs!</font>

319
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea what that is!</font>

320
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Small...</font>

321
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Burst!</font>

322
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The deep sea is scary!</font>

323
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way Luffy and the others could survive down here.</font>

324
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sad.  We finally met after two years,
and now...</font>

325
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!  They won't die that easily!</font>

326
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We used one Coup de Burst after another... There isn't much air left.</font>

327
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  It's so bright!</font>

328
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe it's Fishman Island!
Maybe Luffy and the others are there!</font>

329
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We haven't dived down 3 kilometers yet.</font>

330
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-h-o a-r-e y-o-u?</font>

331
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  What are you sending those signals with?!</i></font>

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you see anything?</font>

333
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still too bright.</font>

334
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!</font>

335
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an angler!  It tricked us!</font>

336
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been caught by a deep sea hunter!
This is not good!</font>

337
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

338
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It lured us right into its trap!  Can we get away?</font>

339
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What is it now?!</i></font>

340
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A human?!</font>

341
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What is that?!</i></font>

342
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A sea monster with the shape of a human!</i></font>

343
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A Sea Bonze!</i></font>

344
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's gonna capsize the ship!</i></font>

345
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The fish?!</i></font>

346
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Angler!  You can't do that!</font>

347
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No eating ships!</font>

348
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times do I hafta tell ya?</font>

349
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Vander Decken's gonna yell at ya!</font>

350
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Did he just save us?</font>

351
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Let's get out of here!  Who cares what happened?</font>

352
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both of them are monsters!</font>

353
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dead men tell no tales and know no greed. </font>

354
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Is that...</font>

355
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this country so black that even crows don't fly,</font>

356
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">...me?</font>

357
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What is that?!</i></font>

358
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the dead need no jewels upon their fingers.</font>

359
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can't even see their own regrets in the darkness.</font>

360
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Search for it!  Search for it!
All sunken treasure belongs to me! </font>

361
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the world's richest man, Captain Vander Decken!</font>

362
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It can't be...</i></font>

363
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even at the bottom of the sea?!</i></font>

364
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nooooooooooo!</i></font>

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's a ghost ship!</i></font>

366
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are <i>you</i> getting scared?!</font>

367
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That is a real one!  Look at the sail!</font>

368
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the legendary Flying Dutchman!
It's a ship that shouldn't exist in this world!</font>

369
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a tale from many centuries ago.</font>

370
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One day, during a storm,</font>

371
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the captain of a ship suddenly went insane.</font>

372
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He started throwing his crewmates
into the stormy sea, killing them one after another.</font>

373
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He even spat in the face of God!</font>

374
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of that captain was Vander Decken!
And the name of the ship was The Flying Dutchman!</font>

375
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He incurred the wrath of God,</font>

376
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and now he's cursed to drift through the seas,
tortured for all eternity!</font>

377
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship we see before us is the very same cursed ship of Captain Vander Decken!</font>

378
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Angler!  Wadatsumi!  If you eat the ship, I won't be able to take their treasure!</font>

379
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smash it!</font>

380
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gotcha!</font>

381
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wah! The Sea Bonze...</font>

382
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's an enemy after all!</font>

383
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!  Use the Coup de Burst!</font>

384
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't!  We're all out of fuel!</font>

385
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to refill the cola in the energy room!</font>

386
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kraken?! </font>

387
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The beast of the North Pole, the Kraken.</font>

388
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ya bastard! </font>

389
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that's enough!</font>

390
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out!</font>

391
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did great!</font>

392
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Heeeey!</i></font>

393
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  Zoro, Sanji!</font>

394
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad you're alive!</font>

395
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-swan!  Robin-chwan!</font>

396
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been looking for you guys!</font>

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They sure caused us a lot of trouble...</font>

398
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Getting separated from us...</font>

399
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Wake up, Wadatsumi!</font>

400
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time for a rematch!  Get them!</font>

401
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me and Sanji's bubbles burst, so we got into Zoro's.  </font>

402
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We almost died!</font>

403
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make us worry so much!</font>

404
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally some space!  Being at home really is the best!</font>

405
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  I was so worried!</font>

406
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm impressed by your vitality!</font>

407
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!  You actually tamed it?!</font>

408
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That monstrous octopus?!</font>

409
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  I'm using him to travel like a pro!</font>

410
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that right, Surume?</font>

411
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you give him a squid name?!</font>

412
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't exactly "pulling" the ship though.</font>

413
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just hope he's careful that he doesn't crush us.</font>

414
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

415
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

416
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad, Captain Vander Decken!</font>

417
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not good!  The underwater volcanoes...</font>

418
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are erupting!</font>
