66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An island's been visible for a while.</font>

been waiting to see an island?!</font>

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey is anyone else curious
about that ship from earlier?</font>

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They said they had no captain or navigator</font>

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and they didn't even have flags
sails motivation or organization...</font>

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of pirates
would go around like that?!</font>

82
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably got into a battle and lost.</font>

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And their captain died
and they got plundered...</font>

84
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No that can't be it!
I got a good look at their ship!</font>

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There weren't any signs of a battle at all!</font>

86
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yet the ship was completely bare of
all the essentials that pirates need!</font>

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they weren't pirates then.
Don't worry about it.</font>

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they sure seemed like pirates to me...</font>

89
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I somehow get a bad feeling about this...</font>

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You always do.</font>

91
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! I wonder if there's a town!
I hope they have a shipyard!</font>

92
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Don't go jumping off right away!</font>

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope we'll get a good shipwright to join us!</font>

94
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're near the shore! Get the anchor ready!</font>

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon guys... Listen to me...</font>

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,630

101
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,370

125
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what kind of island is this?</font>

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hi! We're coming in!</font>

127
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,040

where the boss of the island lives!</font>

129
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,470

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Luffy! Usopp! I found a giraffe!</font>

132
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

133
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That ain't a giraffe...</font>

134
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's got a long neck
but it's a horse. A long-horse...</font>

135
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a horse?</font>

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a pretty horse!</font>

137
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's a girl! She says her name is Shelly!</font>

138
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This saddle must mean
someone's here after all...</font>

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up Luffy?</font>

140
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp.</font>

141
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See those two bamboo trees?
Yeah.</font>

142
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! I can't see their tops! Talk about long!</font>

143
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a closer look...</font>

144
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay...</font>

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're running away!</font>

146
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha...?! This must be another long animal!</font>

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bamboo tree's attacking Luffy!</font>

148
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! You all right?!</font>

149
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let you beat me bamboo!</font>

150
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Careful Luffy!</font>

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber Whip!</font>

152
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! You beat it!</font>

153
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! I cut it!</font>

154
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's your owner?</font>

155
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't know? That sounds lonely...</font>

156
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It could be bad guys! Stay there and hide!</font>

157
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

158
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually...</font>

159
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...I cut a bamboo tree and a spirit appeared!</font>

160
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our ship's... been blocked from leaving?</font>

161
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they planning?!</font>

162
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the ship I saw earlier...</font>

163
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you guys?!</font>

164
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's a fight you want get down here!</font>

165
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are the Foxy Pirates!</font>

166
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be hasty! All we want... is a showdown!</font>

167
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A spirit?</font>

168
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. He appeared after I cut the bamboo tree.</font>

169
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey. Say something you.</font>

170
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I remember you.</font>

171
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been a long time. How are you guys?</font>

172
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of you knows him?</font>

173
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nope.
Me neither...</font>

174
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah no wonder I didn't recognize you.</font>

175
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa what a flake! Who are you old guy?!</font>

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,330
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Nomad
Tonjit</font>

177
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Tonjit. You have my thanks.</font>

178
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I assume you're the ones
who knocked me off my stilts?</font>

179
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stilts?</font>

180
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! They are!</font>

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they were so long
we couldn't see the top at all!</font>

182
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed. I was at the very top!</font>

183
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh so you're not a spirit that came
out because I cut a bamboo tree</font>

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're an old guy who fell
'cause his stilts broke?</font>

185
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why were you on such long stilts anyway?</font>

186
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've always been fond of stilts</font>

187
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I tried to make the world's longest
stilts using this island's bamboo!</font>

188
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I managed to get on them but then
I was too scared to come back down!</font>

189
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're crazy old guy!</font>

190
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was up there... for ten years!</font>

191
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really crazy!</font>

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were on stilts for ten whole years?!</font>

193
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. The bamboo continued
to grow the entire time too...</font>

194
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Making it even harder
for me to come back down...</font>

195
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So scary...</font>

196
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's your only comment after ten years?!</font>

197
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are many trees on this island
just as tall as the stilts though.</font>

198
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was able to survive on fruit I could find.</font>

199
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He talks about it so casually.
Especially after being up there for so long...</font>

200
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speaking of long...</font>

201
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is everything on this
island so long old guy?</font>

202
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might seem that way to an outsider
but there is a reason.</font>

203
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you can see a giant
grassy plain covers this island.</font>

204
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In short everything here is long
due to a longing for excitement.</font>

205
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa. He went and said it.</font>

206
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there for example...</font>

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">..is a plaaatypus.
You just said it longer!</font>

208
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a Daaachshund.</font>

209
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful. There are ferocious animals too.</font>

210
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? That's a snow leooopard.
Don't let it bite you!</font>

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leopard?!</font>

212
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is it only long sideways?!</font>

213
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to my house! I'm in your debt!
Let me offer you some hospitality!</font>

214
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Food!
Yeah!</font>

215
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's custom in this village to treat
visitors to milk from our farm animals.</font>

216
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Village? Where's the village?</font>

217
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And your farm animals...</font>

218
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The village is gone! And the farm animals!</font>

219
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get real. Villages don't just
disappear in ten years you know.</font>

220
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh actually...</font>

221
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well I can explain it later.
For now, let me treat you.</font>

222
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe I had some milk stored away...</font>

223
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stored away? You realize you were
on those stilts for ten years right?</font>

224
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hopefully this cheese is to your liking...</font>

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't look away! That's obviously
your ten-year-old milk!</font>

226
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. That's a shame.</font>

227
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please make yourselves at home then.</font>

228
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? This cheese is edible old guy?</font>

229
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't even try!</font>

230
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay! It's only ten-year-old cheese!</font>

231
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unlike you folks I live a
laid-back life on this island.</font>

232
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's made my stomach different from yours.</font>

233
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Honestly now. Whippersnappers
these days are so frail...</font>

234
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Call... a doctor...</font>

235
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you so you idiot!</font>

236
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor! Doctor!</font>

237
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-That's me!</font>

238
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's food poisoning.</font>

239
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Obviously!</font>

240
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're funny old guy!</font>

241
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're nomads?</font>

242
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. We're carefree nomads
 that're always on the move.</font>

243
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how your village
disappeared after only ten years...</font>

244
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the island of
Long Ring Long Land. Welcome.</font>

245
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's technically a single ring-shaped island</font>

246
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but because of the sea it's usually
divided into ten separate islands.</font>

247
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But on one day a year
the tide gets especially low,</font>

248
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and for those few hours the island
regains its true singular form.</font>

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We use this fact to migrate from one
island to the next every three years.</font>

250
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you got left behind
after the village moved?</font>

251
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like you old guy! You're a big dummy!</font>

252
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they stay on each island for three years,</font>

253
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then it'd take 'em thirty years
to come all the way back here.</font>

254
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Taking away the time you
were stuck on those stilts</font>

255
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you won't see them again
for about twenty more years...</font>

256
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pretty much.</font>

257
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I only I had a hooorse.</font>

258
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I could catch up to the others in five years...</font>

259
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By crossing to a new
island once every year...</font>

260
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Hooorse"?</font>

261
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. The most beautiful
animals on these islands.</font>

262
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They gallop through the
grassy plains so gracefully...</font>

263
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're absolutely necessary
to migrate from island to island.</font>

264
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're strong and can carry large loads.</font>

265
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't migrate on foot either.</font>

266
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tide would come back in before
I even got across to the next island.</font>

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you just take a ship?</font>

268
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know how to sail.</font>

269
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides even if we charged a Log Pose here,</font>

270
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it wouldn't point to the
next island in the ring.</font>

271
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All ten islands are actually
one big island after all.</font>

272
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll just wait here for twenty years.</font>

273
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure? It'll be lonely...</font>

274
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh wait!</font>

275
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is a "hooorse" a "horse"?</font>

276
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh right! A horse! We saw one!</font>

277
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Shelly! You waited for me?!</font>

278
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh Shelly! You're so adorable!
This sure brings back memories!</font>

279
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've grown so long since I last saw you!</font>

280
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a good girl!</font>

281
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must've been so lonely
all by yourself all those years!</font>

282
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you! Thank you!</font>

283
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never leave you again!</font>

284
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah so that horse was waiting
for him the entire time...</font>

285
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's great!</font>

286
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must really like him a lot!</font>

287
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man that horse sure is
fast! I wanna ride too!</font>

288
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She really is graceful!</font>

289
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shelly. Let's cross the sea
together on the next low tide day!</font>

290
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All those days with rain...</font>

291
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All those days with snow...</font>

292
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for waiting through it all!</font>

293
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shelly... Do you really insist
on waiting for Tonjit-san?</i></font>

294
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're going to take all
your friends with us...</i></font>

295
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Are you sure?</i></font>

296
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We won't be back here for 27 years,</i></font>

297
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and we have no idea where Tonjit-san even is.</i></font>

298
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You'll be all by yourself!</i></font>

299
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Take my advice and come with us!</i></font>

300
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Live well Shelly!</i></font>

301
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa there Shelly!</font>

302
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know I'm afraid of heights!</font>

303
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Horse!</font>

304
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old guy!</font>

305
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shelly!</font>

306
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You okay?!
We heard a gunshot!</font>

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this net?!</font>

308
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old guy!</font>

309
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The horse is mine now!</font>

310
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Yeah! That horse is our boss'!</font>

311
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you guys?!</font>

312
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who am I you ask?</font>

313
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're so rude!</font>

314
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't pretend you don't know this face!</font>

315
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know your face! I'm gonna beat it up!</font>

316
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-They don't know me...</font>

317
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Boss! Don't get depressed!</font>

318
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's lying! I bet he's just saying that!</font>

319
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't possibly know him.</font>

320
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop laughing Hamburg!</font>

321
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Foxy! I take whatever I want!</font>

322
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let this be a lesson you fools!</font>

323
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you so worked up
about a single horse?!</font>

324
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hunting is nothing more than entertainment!</font>

325
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...!</font>

326
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...!</font>

327
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

328
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you know my name?!</font>

329
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we know who you are!
We've done our homework!</font>

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Luffy with a
100 million-Belly bounty.</font>

331
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roronoa Zoro with a 60 million-Belly bounty.</font>

332
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A total bounty of 160 million
with only seven people...</font>

333
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's really something.</font>

334
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We Foxy Pirates challenge you
Straw Hats to a Davy Back Fight!</font>

335
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop talking crazy! Just bring it on!
If you wanna fight let's fight!</font>

336
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait Luffy... A Davy Back fight is...</font>

337
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! That explains the ship
we encountered near here!</font>

338
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which way do we turn?!
How should I know?!</font>

339
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone give orders! Navigator!
Don't got one!</font>

340
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!
Don't got one!</font>

341
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on Luffy! That game...!</font>

342
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it! We'll lose crew members!</font>

343
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the deal Usopp?!</font>

344
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you don't agree to his game!</font>

345
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool! I heard you say it Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

346
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You clearly agreed to my challenge just now!</font>

347
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Foxy Pirate
Foxy The Silver Fox
Bounty: 24 Million Belly</font>

348
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't he Porche-chan?!</font>

349
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes Boss! I heard him too!</font>

350
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,360
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Foxy Pirate
Fighter
Porche</font>

351
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you honestly think you can back out now?</font>

352
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well you can't.</font>

353
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,570
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Foxy Pirate
Fighter
Hamburg</font>

354
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or what? You're not man
enough to keep your word?</font>

355
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am too!</font>

356
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get talked into it!
But... the horse!</font>

357
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shelly... Oww!</font>

358
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't push yourself! You hit your back hard!</font>

359
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two! Step aside!
Old guy!</font>

360
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shelly faithfully waited ten
years for me! How dare you!</font>

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait old guy! They're pirates!</font>

362
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Davy Back Fight?</font>

363
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! The fight begins the
moment two captains are in agreement!</font>

364
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>"Unruly"</i></font>

365
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As we speak our captain
is challenging your captain</font>

366
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Luffy to battle!</font>

367
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Challenging? Why bother?</font>

368
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want a fight just start one!</font>

369
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you've never heard of a Davy Back Fight?</font>

370
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not a fight. It's a pirate game.</font>

371
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. A game that supposedly arose
long ago on Pirate Island.</font>

372
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which is said to be a pirate
paradise somewhere in the sea.</font>

373
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In it pirates plunder each other
for top-notch crew members.</font>

374
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates plunder each other?!
Yes.</font>

375
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm amazed you've survived this
long without even knowing that!</font>

376
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Davy Back Fight is about
swiping crew members!</font>

377
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After each match the winner can take...</font>

378
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">any crew member they want
from the opposing team!</font>

379
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoever's chosen must immediately
swear loyalty to their new captain!</font>

380
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the name of Davy Jones,
the pirate of the deep!</font>

381
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if you lose... you lose a crew member?!</font>

382
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

383
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In addition... if the enemy ship
has no one of interest...</font>

384
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can instead be stripped of their
Jolly Roger, the life of their ship!</font>

385
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So crewmates and pride are on the line.</font>

386
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Winning will make you stronger,
while losing will mean a serious loss.</font>

387
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a vicious game.</font>

388
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait... does that mean
that ship we ran across earlier</font>

389
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">without an organized crew
sails or even a captain was...?</font>

390
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Did you run into the
Fang-Frog Pirates' ship?!</font>

391
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fell prey to our game earlier!</font>

392
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say hello to our new crewmates!</font>

393
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Long live the Foxy Pirates!</font>

394
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the former captain of that ship!</font>

395
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Former ship doctor!
Former navigator!</font>

396
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Former shipwright!</font>

397
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We tried five three-coin
games but lost 'em all!</font>

398
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fourteen men and our flag
taken just like that!</font>

399
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With so many people jumping ship like this,</font>

400
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it was more like a merger than anything!</font>

401
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

402
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no talking reason with you!</font>

403
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we'd never agree to such a
ridiculous game in a million years!</font>

404
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool! A regular crew member
can't make that decision!</font>

405
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This game only begins when
two captains reach an agreement!</font>

406
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:57,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like it or not you're all in this game
if your captain nods his head!</font>

407
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're right Nami-san.</font>

408
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an unwritten rule
in the pirate world.</font>

409
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run and we'll be completely humiliated.</font>

410
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if we're humiliated?!</font>

411
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather die than live in shame.</font>

412
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What he said.</font>

413
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you two crazy?!</font>

414
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget about it. This is how men are.</font>

415
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Urgh! I gotta stop Luffy then!</font>

416
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't bother. It's no use.</font>

417
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The captains will signal
the start of the fight</font>

418
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by firing shots at the same time!</font>

419
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just sit here and...!</font>

420
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please no...!</font>

421
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He agreed to it...</font>

422
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine by me.</font>

423
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This should be interesting.</font>

424
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's agreed to the game!</font>

425
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot! You idiot! You idiot!</font>

426
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you agree to it?!</font>

427
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have no idea how horrific this game is!</font>

428
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we just won't lose!</font>

429
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our challenge is now officially accepted!</font>

430
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! I'm gonna kick your butt!</font>

431
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'll be the day!</font>

432
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will too Split-Head!</font>

433
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Split-Head...?
Boss!</font>

434
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you?! Our boss is a sensitive man!</font>

435
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has a heart of glass.
Doesn't suit him though.</font>

436
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! I told you not to laugh!</font>

437
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look Luffy!</font>

438
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thinking about the horse and the
old guy makes me mad too but...!</font>

439
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use that anger to thrash 'em!</font>

440
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got back up way too fast!</font>

441
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!</font>

442
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to teach you a thing or two!</font>

443
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Frankfurters! Get your frankfurters!</font>

444
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rum and cheese! Crackers and salted meat!</font>

445
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got fried buckwheat noodles too!</font>

446
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for the opening ceremony!</font>

447
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please quiet down! Please quiet down!
Shut up! You be quiet!</font>

448
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon! Let's hear the odds!
All participants get ready!</font>

449
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is looking fun!</font>

450
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are all Split-Head's crew members?</font>

451
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! There's so many!</font>

452
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hi. Five jumbo fried buckweats please.</font>

453
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,600
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Cotton Candy</font>

454
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,060
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Fried Buckwheat Noodles</font>

455
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that old guy!</font>

456
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay men! Simmer down!</font>

457
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Porche-chan!
Sexy!</font>

458
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for the pledge to follow
these three rules about losing!</font>

459
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First the only way to take back crewmates
Jolly Rogers or anything else</font>

460
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is through another Davy Back Fight!</font>

461
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Second anyone taken by the winner...</font>

462
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">must swear loyalty to that
ship's captain immediately!</font>

463
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Third if your Jolly Roger is taken
you can't ever display it again!</font>

464
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san! I bought some cotton candy!</font>

465
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you guys be so calm about this?</font>

466
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still moping about that?</font>

467
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should you break these rules
you'll be considered dishonorable pirates</font>

468
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and sent to Davy Jones' Locker!</font>

469
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you swear to uphold them?</font>

470
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I swear!
I swear!</font>

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hereby announce this three-coin
orthodox-rules game...</font>

472
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to Davy Jones!</font>

473
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's Davy Jones?</font>

474
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An old pirate cursed by the devil...</font>

475
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who's said to live in the depths
of the sea to this very day.</font>

476
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He lives at the bottom of the sea?!</font>

477
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what the legend says.</font>

478
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the ships and treasures
that sink into the sea</font>

479
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are said to go to his ship's hull--
his "locker" in other words.</font>

480
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bottom of the sea is scary...</font>

481
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sweet!</font>

482
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates call this a Davy Back</font>

483
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">because you steal whatever
you want from the enemy</font>

484
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just as Davy takes everything
that comes sinking his way.</font>

485
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A captain, a swordsman,
a navigator, a sniper,</font>

486
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a cook, a doctor, and an archaeologist, huh?</font>

487
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then. Who shall I take first?</font>

488
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess it'd have to be that one!</font>

489
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh!</font>

490
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gotten us into a real mess Luffy!</font>

491
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we gotta do is win!</font>

492
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! You forgot somethin'!</font>

493
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Write down your rosters and
give them to our party organizer!</font>

494
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you've chosen
your roster it's set in stone!</font>

495
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey what if we lose?</font>

496
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet they'll want Captain Usopp...</font>

497
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No I bet it'll be me. Because I'm cute...</font>

498
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll now announce the rosters
submitted by both teams!</font>

499
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually my "Can't Be in a Race"
disease is kicking in...</font>

500

you know! Just accept it!</font>

503
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,400

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That orange-haired chick is hot!</font>

523
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want that dark-haired girl on our crew!</font>

524
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't need that other guy!
Yeah. Never mind him.</font>

525
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! The final odds are in!</font>

526
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The top spot obviously goes to our idol,</font>

527
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the member of the powerful
Team Foxy: Porche-chan!</font>

528
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,390

Capote and the star shark Monda!</font>

530
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're riding in the Cutie Wagon!</font>

531
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This'll be a cinch! You can do it!</font>

532
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! You're using a fish!</font>

533
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no rule against fish you know!</font>

534
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be providing commentary during the race</font>

535
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">from atop Chirp-Chirp a rare
South Blue Super Sparrow!</font>

536
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure this won't sink?!
I already told you...</font>

537
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a shipwright!</font>

538
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! On your marks!</font>
