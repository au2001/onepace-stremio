266
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what is it?  What's going on?!</font>

267
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it right there, damn fish!</font>

268
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't eat him, shark!</font>

269
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It hurts not!  It merely itches!</font>

270
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?</font>

271
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's obviously in pain.</font>

272
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts... not!</font>

273
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if something has happened to Sanji-san?!</font>

274
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of him, damn you!</font>

275
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now!</font>

276
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joue Shot!</font>

278
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  The final piece is safe!</font>

279
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this, the samurai puzzle is completed!</font>

280
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've gotta hurry and get back...</font>

281
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">before the path is gone!</font>

282
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

283
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has the poison spread this much?!</font>

284
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!  I've been cut off without realizing it!</font>

285
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can Nami-san's muscles do what I need them to?</font>

286
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will cause her trouble later, but...</font>

287
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

288
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison has
almost completely spread through the lake!</font>

289
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san, hurry!</font>

290
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,630

291
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,240

292
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san!</font>

293
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that, he got him!</font>

294
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He really did!</font>

295
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What can I say?</font>

296
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never before have I been so happy
just to have the body I was born with!</font>

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I don't.</font>

348
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we try igniting them?</font>

349

352
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scorches its enemies?  That sounds like magic!</font>

353
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He... cut the flames!</font>

354
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way is open.</font>

355
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am coming for you now, Momonosuke!</font>

356
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the?!  We're unharmed!</font>

357
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that we were
just engulfed by the flames of that explosion!</font>

358
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">K-K-Kin'emon-san... What just happened?</font>

359
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I merely cut the explosion in pieces.</font>

360
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You <i>cut</i> it?!</font>

361
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My Foxfire Style scorches enemies with flames,</font>

362

one of its special techniques is to cut flames apart.</font>

363

364
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, I shall head for the laboratory to rescue Momonosuke.</font>

365
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please excuse me!</font>

366
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it!</font>

367
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your samurai fighting style has caught my interest.</font>
