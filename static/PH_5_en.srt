<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Hey!</font>

7
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Imagine meeting you!  It's me!</font>

during the Whitebeard war.</font>

15
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he even treated my injuries!</font>

16
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did?</font>

17

20
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought I'd meet you here!</font>

21
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, thanks a lot for before!</font>

23
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,850

35
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,030

36
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there is no need to feel indebted to me

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,300

128
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,240

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If this is just some silly superstition to make the cold go away,</font>

134
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna flatten you!</font>

135
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

136
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doron!</font>

137
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!</i></font>

138
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's going on?!</i></font>

139
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got coats!  And shoes too!</font>

140
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How?!  What did he do?!</font>

141
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gloves!</font>

142
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's warm!</font>

143
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so warm!</font>

144
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, I consumed a rare kind of fruit,</font>

145
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and ever since, I have been able to use magic...</font>

146
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to change any object into a disguise!</font>

147
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am not familiar with clothing from foreign lands, but will these do?</font>

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though I must warn you that it's magic,
so the clothes will vanish if you remove them.</font>

149
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yay, thank you!</i></font>

150
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmph, don't go overboard!</font>

151
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got Devil Fruit powers?</font>

152
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you know...</font>

153
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you could do this...</font>

154
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>why didn't you do it right away?!</i></font>

155
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... it's such a waste to conceal those breasts.</font>

156
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

157
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That itches...</font>

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That itches, it does!</font>

159
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just can't bring yourself
to say that you're hurt or that it's cold, huh.</font>

160
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because I'm a warrior.</font>

161
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There they are!  Hey guys!</font>

162
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Heeeey!</i></font>

163
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heeey!  Heeey!</font>

164
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they doing here?</font>

165
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, are you alright?</font>

166
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's them!</font>

167
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Luffy's group!  Zoro!  Usopp!</font>

168
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!  Brook!</font>

169
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad you're here!</font>

170
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is that idiot cook so enthusiastic?</font>

171
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he trying to stay warm?</font>

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  It looks like a bunch of giant kids, but...</font>

173
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  Hey!</font>

174
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!  Cut it out, Franky!</font>

175
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,890
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>The Straw Hats' Shelter</b></font>

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here!  This place will do.</font>

177
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This equipment looks like the stuff in the laboratory.</font>

178
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's all in pieces.
Maybe there was some kind of big explosion.</font>

179
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, as long as they shields us from the blizzard,
it doesn't matter.</font>

180
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, where do we start?</font>

181
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's gonna leave a scar on my fragile body!</font>

182
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take care of you right away!</font>

183
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Sanji-kun!  What are you doing with my body?!</font>

184
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Chopper!</font>

185
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My lower half has returned to me, it has!</font>

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Legson... My hind-legs...</font>

187
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you, there's no such creature!</font>

188
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is quite surreal.</font>

189
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an odd fellow.</font>

190
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The skeleton...</font>

191
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is talking!</font>

192
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, do the tank thing!</font>

193
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you shoot another beam?</font>

194
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon!</font>

195
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

196
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is he on the inside again?</font>

197
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Are you sure?</font>

198
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're having a hard time dealing with this, right?</font>

199
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just calm down and talk this over, everyone.</font>

200
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  So, who turned into who?</font>

201
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First off, I'm Franky!</font>

202
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come to me if you get hurt!</font>

203
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Chopper!</font>

204
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get hurt, I'll treat your wounds!</font>

205
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Nami.</font>

206
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather die than fire a beam!</font>

207
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And... We...</font>

208
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>are Nami-san!</i></font>

209
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've been waiting for this!</i></font>

210
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think Nami is being too crude.</font>

211
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't do it again!
Please, don't hurt Nami-san any more!</font>

212
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it, Nami!  You'll kill yourself!</font>

213
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you touch my body,
it'll cost you 200 thousand beli!</font>

214
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Peeping will cost you 100 thousand!</font>

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How will I survive?!</font>

216
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long are you gonna keep laughing?!  Stop acting like this doesn't concern you!</font>

217
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, to start at the beginning...</font>

218
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this is the samurai from the Wano Kingdom
that we've heard about.</font>

219
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The distress call that we received
was meant for the Crocotaur they called Boss.</font>

220
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It came from one of his subordinates.</font>

221
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is because the samurai
was relentlessly attacking the centaurs.</font>

222
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I was only attempting to find and rescue
my missing son, Momonosuke.</font>

223
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I merely cut down those who stood in my way.</font>

224
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And behold!</font>

225
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All these children were imprisoned in that facility.</font>

226
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Momonosuke must be in there somewhere as well!</font>

227
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we weren't the only children.</font>

228
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We hadn't even learned all of the new kids' names yet.</font>

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the question now is,
what happened after they sent the distress call?</font>

230
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the man from earlier.</font>

231
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They referred to him
as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>

232
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

233
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Traf... is one of the Seven Warlords now?!</font>

234
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.
He joined their ranks during the past two years.</font>

235
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before I knew it, I had been cut into three parts...</font>

236
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My head was thrown inside the facility.</font>

237
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My torso was simply abandoned.</font>

238
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My legs seem to have been used as monster bait.</font>

239
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was running around, relying on my senses,
when I must have become stuck to something.</font>

240
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the back of the dragon's head.</font>

241
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, you were talking about that "Damn Warlord" earlier, right?</font>

242
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  It was just a pair of legs, right?  How could he have talked?</font>

243
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a good question.</font>

244
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that...</font>

245
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was me farting.</font>

246
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is a talent I have possessed for a long time, it is.</font>

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were <i>farting?</i>  That's disgusting!</font>

248
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed it...</font>

249
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  The place is starting to stink!</font>

250
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, it is quite comical
how you're just legs and a head!</font>

251
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I, on the other hand,
encountered someone who was just a torso!</font>

252
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That obviously must be this guy's torso!</font>

253
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're right!</font>

254
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see it?!  Where?!</font>

255
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you encounter my torso?!</font>

256
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ummm, are you alright...
without a heart... Tashigi-chan?</font>

257
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, strangely enough.</font>

258
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's acting really shy.</font>

259
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ships that were hidden near the laboratory...</font>

260
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">had "CC" written on them.</font>

261
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Really, Vice-Admiral Smoker?</font>

262
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  Had they been the same ships that were used here in the past,</font>

263
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they should have said "PH" for Punk Hazard.</font>

264
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we assume that someone above Law
is pulling his strings, and that "CC" is their initials...</font>

265
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I have a hunch who it might be.</font>

266
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If <i>he</i> is on this island...</font>

267
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then it would explain quite a lot.</font>

268
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor Vegapunk's former associate...</font>

269
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the scientist...</font>

270
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar Clown.</font>

271
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think you were doing, Law?!</font>

272
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should be the one to complain...</font>

273
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar!</font>

274
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something has been bothering me.</font>

275
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

276
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If my memory serves me correctly...</font>

277
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a lot of children have been abducted in this region
over the last few years.</font>

278
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Abductions?</font>

279
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

280
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But more importantly,
I can't get used to this new Captain-chan!</font>

281
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't help it.  Please try to deal with it!</font>

282
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tashigi!  What are you talking about?</font>

283
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't heard a damn thing about kids being snatched.</font>

284
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please button your shirt, Smoker-san!</font>

285
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This "open" Captain-chan looks great, but she's horrifying on the inside!</font>

286
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cram it!</font>

287
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There haven't been any reports from this region,
except for the occasional shipwreck.</font>

288
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now that you mention it,
it does seem like a lot of kids die in this sea.</font>

289
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right.  Right?</font>

290
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

291
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to the communications division...</font>

292
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I don't have my glasses.</font>

293
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...many reports of kidnapped children have been made to G-5.</font>

294
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in the newspaper, they're all announced as shipwrecks, piracy, or missing persons.</font>

295
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, it's possible that
the reports were originally wrong and then corrected.</font>

296
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... But it is also possible that...</font>

297
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like you're hesitating, Tashigi.</font>

298
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have an opinion, then state it plainly!</font>

299
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Based on the number of children that we just saw...</font>

300
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you think that the reports of abduction were correct...</font>

301
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the kidnapper could be on this island, right?</font>

302
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in order for that to be true...</font>

303
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:13,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a member of G-5 would have to be
covering up the kidnappings by lying to the media.</font>

304
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that means that
someone inside G-5 is helping the culprit?</font>

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Smo-san!  I can't believe you're doubting us!</font>

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We may be the outcasts of the Navy,</font>

307
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we still have our pride as Marines!</font>

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shut the hell up!</i></font>

309
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She {/i1}is{/i0} scary!</font>

310
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiots like you aren't even worth suspecting!</font>

311
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

312
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't let yourselves
have the wrong idea about the Navy, either.</font>

313
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All organizations contain multiple people,</font>

314
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so none of them can ever be perfect!</font>

315
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll overlook enemies if you let yourself think that the Navy's perfect!  Don't be deceived by appearances!</font>

316
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes Ma'am, Captain-chan!</font>

317
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys... Whatever.</font>

318
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm the captain!</font>

319
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  That's right!  We were deceived by appearances!</font>

320
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Smoker-san, I'm still not entirely convinced.</font>

321
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.
It's just a theory that we should keep in mind.</font>

322
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case,
my body and heart has been taken by Law.</font>

323
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't leave the island.</font>

324
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A third of you guys will go to the ship and report this.</font>

325
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about, Vice-Admiral?</font>

326
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship's been sliced to pieces.</font>

327
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said there were other ships, didn't I?</font>

328
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go steal one.</font>

329
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  That was your plan!  You're a villain!</font>

330
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful.</font>

331
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before this situation gets any worse,
I'm gonna get my heart and body back...</font>

332
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and then I'll expose
the one who's pulling the strings on this island!</font>

333
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,310
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Former Vegapunk Lab</b></font>

334
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,310
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Laboratory #3</b></font>

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally got through to him.</font>

336
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have permission to kill them all.</font>

337
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates, G-5, and Foxfire Kinemon.</font>

338
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter who dies on this island,
Joker can make it look like an accident at sea.</font>

339
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capture as many of them as you can!</font>

340
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The more test subjects we have the better.</font>

341
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Master.</font>

342
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if they make trouble for you,
then feel free to kill them with gas.</font>

343
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Law?</font>

344
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He left the room a while ago.</font>

345
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter.</font>

346
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that
one of them has a bounty of 400 million.</font>

347
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't push yourselves too hard.</font>

348
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In addition, the crew has bounties from 120 million down to fifty.</font>

349
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The total bounty for the Straw Hat Crew
is 800 million and fifty beli.</font>

350
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But for two years,
they've vanished off of the face of the planet.</font>

351
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their bounties haven't changed in all that time.</font>

352
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their actual strength might be higher than the numbers indicate.</font>

353
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're always thorough with your research, Monet.</font>

354
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

355
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?
Were you in the freezing cold without a coat?</font>

356
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was stolen by pirates.</font>

357
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But more importantly,
they took Boss Brownbeard!</font>

358
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, save him!</font>

359
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, what a pity.</font>

360
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about Brownbeard.  I'll definitely get him back.</font>

361
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry now and go to the inner chamber.</font>

362
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're very lucky.  I just finished a new medicine.</font>

363
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something that will warm your body
and heal your wounds.</font>

364
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  You've saved me.  Please help the others too!</font>

365
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.  But first, you need to save yourself.</font>

366
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you so much!  Thank you so much!</font>

367
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  What is this, Usopp?!</font>

368
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is pretty super!</font>

369
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I give up.</font>

370
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, Usopp!</font>

371
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It detracts from Nami's beauty!</font>

372
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop complaining!
Without these, we'll get totally confused!</font>

373
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard?</font>

374
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  Surely you've heard the name?</font>

375
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole world used to know me by that name!</font>

376
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never heard of ya.</font>

377
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?!</font>

378
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happened?  Until recently,
you weren't willing to open your mouth...</font>

379
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but now we can't get you to shut up.</font>

380
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because you're going to be dead soon.</font>

381
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law is going to come and save me.</font>

382
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate all the pirates from your generation, but Law is different.</font>

383
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean by "our generation"?</font>

384
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you know?  Fool.</font>

385
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The eleven rookies worth over 100 million beli...</font>

386
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who met at the Sabaody Archipelago two years ago, and Blackbeard.</font>

387
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People are calling you "The Worst Generation".</font>

388
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're problem children born into the gap between
two eras, forced to live in the chaos that entails.</font>

389
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After the death of Whitebeard, you stormed
into the New World and caused havoc on the seas.</font>

390
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every time there's a major incident,
it's always someone from your generation.</font>

391
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard, Kid, Law, Drake, Hawkins.</font>

392
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My very own Brownbeard Pirate Crew
was broken by Basil Hawkins!</font>

393
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of him, I lost my legs
and had to give up being a pirate.</font>

394
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just barely managed
to escape with our lives and crawl to Punk Hazard.</font>

395
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you know what this place is?</font>

396
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

397
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place... This island...</font>

398
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It used to be filled with verdant forests,
overflowing with life.</font>

399
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place?</font>

400
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't even imagine it.</font>

401
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The government scientist, Vegapunk,
used to conduct his experiments here.</font>

402
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He performed many experiments with weapons and medicine here.</font>

403
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say that there were prisoners who never went to jail.</font>

404
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead, they were brought to this island
and used as human guinea pigs.</font>

405
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, four years ago, one of Vegapunk's
chemical weapon experiments went horribly wrong.</font>

406
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two of the three labs were destroyed.</font>

407
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are the ruins of one of those labs.</font>

408
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, the explosion must have been huge.</font>

409
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder it's all torn up.</font>

410
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The explosion created a wave of burning heat that spread poison across the entire island.</font>

411
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wiped out all natural life.</font>

412
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that happened, the Government just abandoned the prisoners who were used as test subjects.</font>

413
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleeing the island, they sealed it off behind them!</font>

414
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The abandoned prisoners shut themselves
into the only lab that remained intact, Lab Three.</font>

415
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the only way that they could escape the poison gas that enveloped the island.</font>

416
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:54,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Due to the nerve gas, those who didn't die
almost always lost the ability to move their legs.</font>

417
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They had given up all hope.</font>

418
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But after a year,
our generous Master descended upon this island!</font>

419
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With his special power,
he cleansed the gas from the island.</font>

420
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he used science to help the prisoners who couldn't walk and took them in as his subordinates!</font>

421
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  Master!</font>

422
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

423
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master-san!</font>

424
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I arrived on the island a year after he did,
two years ago now.</font>

425
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was still some remnants of the poison gas left.</font>

426
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Breathing it made you nauseous.</font>

427
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't have the strength to live.</font>

428
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had given up, thinking I was surely at my end.</font>

429
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was when I saw them, the former prisoners who had lost their legs like me, and Master.</font>

430
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And just like them,
my life was also saved by Master's kindness.</font>

431
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Vegapunk, who stole my comrades' legs, is a devil,</font>

432
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then Master is the kind-hearted god of salvation.</font>

433
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then a few months ago,</font>

434
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">another god of salvation, Trafalgar Law, a new member of the Seven Warlords, came to this island.</font>

435
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With his ability,
he gave legs to those of us who couldn't walk.</font>

436
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legs of animals!</font>

437
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We, who thought we'd never walk again,
cried tears of joy.</font>

438
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a great story!</font>

439
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew Traf was a great guy!</font>

440
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He saved me, too!</font>

441
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know Vegapunk was such a cruel man.</font>

442
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the sheep-people we saw in the lab
were created by Law's powers.</font>

443
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that explains the centaurs and the bird-lady too.</font>

444
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But wait, what about the dragon?</font>

445
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you saw the dragon?</font>

446
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's an artificial creature that Vegapunk created to protect the island.</font>

447
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can adapt to any environment.</font>

448
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Celestial Dragons
took a liking to it and gave it a name,</font>

449
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I forgot it.</font>

450
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you see it again, just run away.  It's very violent.</font>

451
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it.</font>

452
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I already ate it.</font>

453
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway,
do you understand who's in charge of the island?</font>

454
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't allow anyone else to invade.</font>

455
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island, Punk Hazard, belongs to our Master.</font>

456
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rejoice!</font>

457
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even now, Master is continuing his research for the benefit of the future of mankind.</font>

458
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He needs but a few human test subjects, and you get to become those subjects!</font>

459
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't escape!</font>

460
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?  What's happening?</font>

461
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

462
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

463
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pain...</font>

464
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What...</font>

465
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of medicine is this?</font>

466
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

467
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

468
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out of here!</font>

469
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try to endure it for a little while longer.</font>

470
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you feel now?</font>

471
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nausea?  A cough?  That's fine.  Do you have a headache?</font>

472
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My head!  It's gonna split in two!</font>

473
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I see.</font>

474
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  It wasn't Vegapunk?</font>

475
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, who was it, Smo-san?</font>

476
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was actually behind the giant explosion?</font>

477
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who made the weapon, and the one who blew it up,</font>

478
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was Caesar Clown.</font>

479
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the time,
he was the number two of the science division,</font>

480
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but his methods were inhumane
and he was always challenging Vegapunk.</font>

481
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Master!</font>

482
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Save me!</font>

483
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you see?</font>

484
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are there any hallucinations?</font>

485
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-There's a giant snake in here!</font>

486
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course there isn't!</font>

487
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's enough.  Time to end your pain.</font>

488
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vegapunk took the blame for the accident, but that's just because he was in charge.</font>

489
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, it's a crime to develop a weapon of
mass destruction that covers an island in poison gas.</font>

490
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once we figured out
the cause of the accident, we captured Caesar.</font>

491
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But his power proved to be too strong
and he escaped from the prisoner transport ship.</font>

492
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been in hiding ever since.</font>

493
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he really is continuing his research on this island,
we've got to stop it quickly.</font>

494
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before he commits another heinous crime!</font>

495
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to try again.</font>

496
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another failure?</font>

497
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Failure?!  Watch your mouth!</font>

498
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Former Government Scientist</b></font>

499
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Bounty: 300 million beli</b></font>

500
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:04,020
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Master Caesar Clown</b></font>

501
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My experiments never fail.</font>

502
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one four years ago wasn't a failure, either.</font>

503
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Government spouted such nonsense!</font>

504
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A failed experiment?</font>

505
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I showed how my weapon could kill an entire island!</font>

506
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the failure in that?!</font>

507
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When it comes to killing enemies, I'm the best in the world.</font>

508
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I've also tracked the progress
of every single one of the survivors, without fail!</font>

509
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you watch!  I'll show them
who the number one scientist in the world is!</font>
