00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy!</font>

128
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a relief!</font>

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What're you doing here?</font>

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">N-Nami?</font>

131
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nami! Nami! Nami! Nami!</font>

132
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is bad.</font>

133
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy!</font>

134
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy!</font>

135
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!</font>

136
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy!</font>

137
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ow-ow-ow...</font>

138
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's horrible! A dinosaur ate Nami!</font>

139
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wait! What?!</font>

140
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">One moment we were running 
through the jungle to escape it,</font>

141
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and the next she was gone!</font>

142
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What have I done?!
I let my crewmate get killed!</font>

143
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">H-Hold on! Calm down, you two!</font>

144
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You said she suddenly disappeared,
but did you check and make sure?</font>

145
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Are you crazy?! I was too terrified
to check and make sure!</font>

146
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If not a dinosaur,
then it was a wild beast!</font>

147
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What else could it have been?!</font>

148
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't know.</font>

149
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But if someone from Baroque Works
followed us onto this island,</font>

150
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">then it would make sense if 
Nami-<i>san</i> was taken instead of you.</font>

151
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?! Baroque Works 
might be on the island?!</font>

152
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wait... why <i>wouldn't</i> 
they go after me?</font>

153
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Because there's only a slim chance
you're on their hit list.</font>

154
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah! That makes sense!</font>

155
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Plus, that alcohol 
might've been meant for us, too!</font>

156
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That alcohol?! What do you mean?!</font>

157
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy brought your alcohol to Dorry.</font>

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And when Dorry drank it,
it exploded inside his stomach.</font>

159
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?! Our alcohol exploded inside his stomach?!</font>

160
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're saying he continued
the duel all busted up like that?!</font>

161
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just see what happened to me 
when I tried to stop him!</font>

162
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can't be serious!</font>

163
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Those two've fought on equal ground 
at full strength for 100 years!</font>

164
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's probably the most
honorable battle ever fought!</font>

165
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah.</font>

166
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They can't settle the fight 
like this now!</font>

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's wrong?!</font>

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He's still fighting.</font>

169
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes. Dorry the Blue Ogre
is quite stubborn indeed.</font>

170
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Perhaps I should assist one of them.</font>

171
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">One century.</font>

172
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It was a long battle!</font>

173
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Elbaf, the god of war,
has passed his judgment.</i></font>

174
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>He has decided that this is my fate.</i></font>

175
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>I didn't have his divine protection.
That's all.</i></font>

176
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">â€“ Luffy!
â€“ Luffy-<i>san<font size="10"> </font></i></font>?!

177
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Who was it?!</font>

178
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Show yourself!</font>

179
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 3. I think I heard something.</font>

180
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How amusing! An underdog loser,
yelping out here in the jungle!</font>

181
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Seventy-three thousand...</font>

182
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">four hundred sixty-seven duels.</font>

183
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Seventy-three thousand 
four hundred sixty-six draws...</font>

184
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and one win!</font>

185
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Tears of joy over your victory?
Simpletons have it so easy.</font>

186
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Though, perhaps I'll
congratulate you for now.</font>

187
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Tears of joy?!</font>

188
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What would you know?!
Just who are you?!</font>

189
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 3. Please excuse the code name.
I'm a mere wax sculptor.</font>

190
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And this is my assistant and 
realist painter, Miss Golden Week.</font>

191
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's more,
I've already captured you.</font>

192
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wh-What <i>is</i> this?!</font>

193
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All right, Luffy!</font>

194
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I dunno who we're dealing with,
but I'll go take care of them myself!</font>

195
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll come with you!</font>

196
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes! Please come with me!
I'll need the moral support!</font>

197
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's no need for that!</font>

198
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's you guys!</font>

199
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can have him back.
We don't need him.</font>

200
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo!</font>

201
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why, you!</font>

202
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, who are they?</font>

203
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They're from that last town!</font>

204
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What are you doing here?!
Karoo has nothing to do with this!</font>

205
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's right. This bird has
absolutely nothing to do with this.</font>

206
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The only one we considered
a threat was that straw hat guy.</font>

207
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The plan was to make the bird 
call you away from that guy,</font>

208
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but the duck was just too obstinate.</font>

209
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Now! Call for your owner!</i></font>

210
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Quack especially loud,
and we'll let you go free!</i></font>

211
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Fine! Want us to make you quack?!</i></font>

212
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Call for the princess!</i></font>

213
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Call for help this instant!</i></font>

214
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Open your mouth, you damn bird!</i></font>

215
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But it looks like Straw Hat's 
already out of the picture.</font>

216
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So the duck's no use to us now.</font>

217
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo!</font>

218
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a stupid bird!</font>

219
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why, you!</font>

220
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Are you the ones
who made the alcohol explode?!</font>

221
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes, that was us. Who's this guy?</font>

222
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Is he on the list?</font>

223
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No. Perhaps he's a shipmate.
Let's make him disappear too!</font>

224
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, you interfered
with the giants' duel!</font>

225
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It was them?! I'll kick their asses!</font>

226
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>You're</i> the ones who'll disappear!</font>

227
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh? You're gonna start something, Miss Wednesday?</font>

228
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What makes you think 
you're a match for officer agents?</font>

229
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Peacock Slasher!</font>

230
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Take this!</font>

231
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lethal Exploding Star!</font>

232
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes!</font>

233
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Thanks for the updraft!</font>

234
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nose Fancy Cannon!</font>

235
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Pitiful man!</font>

236
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Usopp!</font>

237
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ten Thousand Kilo Press!</font>

238
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Give it a rest.</font>

239
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why so agitated?
We're not going to kill you just yet.</font>

240
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We only came to capture you.
All per Mr. 3's orders.</font>

241
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 3?! The Wax-Wax Fruit man?!
Does that mean he's here?!</font>

242
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's right.</font>

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He's a candle man who controls
wax secreted from his body.</font>

244
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A candle man?!</font>

245
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You guys are gonna pay for this!</font>

246
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You wretch! What <i>is</i> all this?!</font>

247
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Isn't it obvious?</font>

248
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm creating a work of art.</font>

249
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just be a good little girl.</font>

250
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Did you honestly think you could 
escape from Baroque Works?</font>

251
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Even that guy with the bounty
of 30 million was no match for us.</font>

252
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I can finally say thanks for 
what happened at Whisky Peak.</font>

253
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You wannabe pirates had it coming</font>

254
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">for sticking your noses
in such a sensitive operation.</font>

255
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We've already captured your
swordsman friend and the other girl.</font>

256
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You caught Zoro?</font>

257
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then you guys're dead meat!</font>

258
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh?</font>

259
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You talk awfully big</font>

260
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">for a guy who received one of my 
Kicky Bombs to the face.</font>

261
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Those don't hurt one bit!</font>

262
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm gonna kick all your asses!</font>

263
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Pitiful.</font>

264
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

265
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Die!</font>

266
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Chump!</font>

267

<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i>!

269
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's go, Miss Valentine.</font>

270
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

271
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Usopp-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Karoo!

272
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Damn you!</font>

273
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Give it up! Give it up!</font>

274
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Once solidified, my candle jacket 
is as hard as steel!</font>

275
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You giants may have brutish strength,</font>

276
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but you're weak when 
compared to these bonds.</font>

277
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brainpower wins out in the end.</font>

278
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I won't stoop
to needlessly face you head on.</font>

279
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Upon tasting of victory, 
you lowered your guard,</font>

280
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy the Red Ogre.</font>

281
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't glare at me like that.
You're so <i>terrifying<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

282
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You should be thrilled!</font>

283
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The duel has finally arrived at its long-awaited end.</font>

284
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Didn't you fight for a whole century 
with your so-called pride on the line?</font>

285
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Shouldn't the taste of victory
be especially sweet, then?</font>

286
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Even if the fruit is borne 
of another's assistance?</font>

287
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Am I wrong?</font>

288
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Filthy sneak! You didn't!</font>

289
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But indeed!
The final victory belongs to me!</font>

290
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Were you aware that your massive, long-standing bounties</font>

291
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">amounted to 200 million belly?</font>

292
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Today, that is still the case.</font>

293
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You scum!</font>

294
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I feel as if I've stumbled upon
a long-lost treasure!</font>

295
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So that's what you're after, huh?!</font>

296
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 3!</font>

297
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Here she is.</font>

298
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Our company's little traitor.</font>

299
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What took so long?
I was getting sick of waiting.</font>

300
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Your underhanded scheme went too far, Mr. 3!</font>

301
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You arranged for Dorry-<i>san</i>'s
alcohol to explode!</font>

302
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?!</font>

303
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Alcohol?</font>

304
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You mean the drink I gave him?!</font>

305
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Dorry! How was your drink?!
Hit the spot, didn't it?!</i></font>

306
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Yeah. Truly the nectar of the gods.</i></font>

307
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, that's what you meant?! Dorry!</font>

308
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You wretched girl! Who said you 
could give away company secrets?</font>

309
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, no matter. Not that it 
will do you any good now.</font>

310
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Candle...</font>

311
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lock!</font>

312
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 5!</font>

313
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Bring the swordsman and the girl!</font>

314
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We're about to begin!</font>

315
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Extra-Large Candle Set!</font>

316
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Th-This is Mr. 3's ability?!</font>

317
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's going on?!</font>

318
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Here they are.</font>

319
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Disgraceful.</font>

320
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Getting bested by these lowlifes 
was beyond embarrassing.</font>

321
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm disgusted with myself.</font>

322
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can't help that you're weak.</font>

323
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh? What was that?</font>

324
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">None of your concern! 
Just set up my candles already!</font>

325
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Set up?</font>

326
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What is that?!</font>

327
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nami-<i>san</i>... Mr. Bushido...</font>

328
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Vivi! What happened?!
Weren't you with Luffy?!</font>

329
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes, I was, butâ€“</font>

330
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If you mean Straw Hat,
I took him out myself!</font>

331
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And I didn't even break a sweat.</font>

332
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Is that right?</font>

333
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Welcome, one and all, 
to my service set!</font>

334
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Is this how it feels 
to be a candle stuck in a cake?</font>

335
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's that spinning thing up there?</font>

336
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And I can't move my legs.</font>

337
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Makes sense for them
to keep us immobilized.</font>

338
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They're the enemy.</font>

339
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Damn. Too hard.</font>

340
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And I can't get a solid hit on it 
from this stance.</font>

341
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Something's raining down!</font>

342
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I hope you enjoy my candle service!</font>

343
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The wax particles 
settling down on you</font>

344
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">will soon transform you 
into wax sculptures!</font>

345
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You'll become perfect 
models of humankind,</font>

346
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">such that I never could have 
achieved with my skill alone!</font>

347
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:19,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Behold the birth of wax statues
that literally have souls!</font>

348
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now die, in the name of art.</font>

349
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Screw that!</font>

350
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why do <i>we</i> have
to become your works of art?!</font>

351
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Get back up 
and crush these maniacs!

352
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You'll turn into
a wax statue too, you know!</font>

353
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Man, that's a huge person.</font>

354
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nothing you say 
will move him to action!</font>

355
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Despite a proud victory, he's realized
the absurdity of his tears of joy.</font>

356
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He slew his friend Dorry, 
with whom he fought for 100 years,</font>

357
00:27:53,310 --> 00:28:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but he utterly failed to notice the 
injuries Dorry had already sustained!</font>

358
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Or, perhaps, were you actually 
crying for your dear friend?</font>

359
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whatever the case, there's no turning
back the hands of time, you fool!</font>

360
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I knew.</font>

361
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I knew about it.</font>

362
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">From the moment 
we resumed our duel,</font>

363
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I knew Dorry was hiding something.</font>

364
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You knew, huh?</font>

365
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A likely story!</font>

366
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If so, then why didn't you 
call off the duel?</font>

367
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Anyone could see there was 
no restraint in your killing blow!</font>

368
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A coward who knows 
nothing of valor in battle</font>

369
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">would never understand 
the truth behind my tears!</font>

370
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And how <i>could</i> you know?!</font>

371
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Should I dishonor a warrior</font>

372
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">who hides his injuries 
and does battle anyway?!</font>

373
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A wounded warrior who chooses 
to keep fighting asks not for mercy!</font>

374
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And now, I know 
the reason behind it.</font>

375
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now that I know, I'm going to 
settle this with my own two hands!</font>

376
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's the very least I can do
to honor my dear friend Dorry!</font>

377
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What an annoying, talkative monster.</font>

380
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,130

381
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,800

382
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You gonna let them 
get away with this?</font>

383
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No. No way.</font>

384
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Are you... angry too?</font>

385
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Okay then! Let's all three of us 
go kick their asses!</font>

386
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Brogy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

387
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a halfwit!</font>

388
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I underestimated just how brutishly
strong these giants can be!</font>

389
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's clear now that simply 
restraining you won't be enough!</font>

390
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wax Wax Arts: Handcuffs!</font>

391
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm just getting started!</font>

392
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And now, for the finishing touch!</font>

393
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Take this!</font>

394
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just try to move now, will you?!</font>

395
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is deranged...</font>

396
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And now, accelerate, candle service!</font>

397
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Turn these people into wax figures!</font>

398
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">M-My chest is starting to burn.</font>

399
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The wax mist is 
getting into our lungs!</font>

400
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">At this rate, we'll turn into 
wax statues from the inside out!</font>

401
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes! Yes! The more you appear to be in pain, the better!</font>

402
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Expressions of pain and agony 
are the very things I seek in art!</font>

403
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">May you solidify 
while filled with terror!</font>

404
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You call this art,
you creepy topknot freak?!</font>

405
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And how dare you 
do that to Brogy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

406
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This'll come back to bite you 
in the ass! You hear?!</font>

407
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Scream and holler all you want!</font>

408
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">For 100 years,</font>

409
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">day in and day out,
we fought and fought.</font>

410
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We dueled to maintain our pride 
as warriors of Elbaf!</font>

411
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So then, how is this what 
you promised, Oh Elbaf, god of war?!</font>

412
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If this is how we are
to meet our end, Oh Elbaf,</font>

413
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">do we not deserve better?!</font>

414
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Should we not die in battle?!</font>

415
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a great look!</font>

416
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes! That sorrow!
That grief! That struggle!</font>

417
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What a marvelous work of art!</font>

418
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh Elbaf!</font>

419
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh, no! My hands won't move!</font>

420
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't wanna die this way!
Can't we do something?!</font>

421
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My body's already becoming stiff!</font>

422
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What do we do?!</font>

423
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Zoro! Do something!</font>

424
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, old man.</font>

425
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can still move, can't you?</font>

426
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So can I.</font>

427
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whaddya say we crush these guys... together?</font>

428
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hold on, Zoro! What are you doing?!
You're not seriouslyâ€“</font>

429
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah.</font>

430
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't joke about 
cutting off your legs!</font>

431
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's not a joke.
It's the only way outta here.</font>

432
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And you two?</font>

433
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What <i>about</i> us?! 
It's futile!</font>

434
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Even if you escape,
they'll just catch you again!</font>

435
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's no way to know that 
unless we try!</font>

436
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After all, we're gonna 
kick the bucket if we stay here.</font>

437
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Instead, let's put up 
one hell of a struggle!</font>

438
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm not gonna lie down 
and die for this scum!</font>

439
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Right?!</font>

440
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What the hell? Is he crazy?</font>

441
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A mere bluff! What he's 
threatening to do is ludicrous!</font>

442
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's all an act!</font>

443
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're pretty cocky, kiddo.</font>

444
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How embarrassing. I had just about 
lost the will to fight.</font>

445
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But your fiery spirit 
has me raring to go!</font>

446
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can't be serious! Right?!</font>

447
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And how will you fight once you're free?!</font>

448
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Who knows?</font>

449
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But... I plan to win.</font>

450
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's with these guys?!
They're off their rockers!</font>

451
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What kind of man is he?!</font>

452
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Still, I've seen this look 
somewhere before.</font>

453
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Princess Vivi!</i></font>

454
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Are you resolved to stay alive?</i></font>

455
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">W-Wait! I'll fight, too!</font>

456
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">â€“ Vivi!
â€“ Good to hear.</font>

457
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's do it, kiddo!</font>

458
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ridiculous! Do you even 
have a plan of attack?!</font>

459
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, you guys!</font>

460
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm gonna kick your asses,
just you wait!</font>

461
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?</font>

462
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's do it, Usopp!</font>

463
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Yeah!</font>

464
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Bird!</font>

465
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Usopp!</font>

466
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo!</font>

467
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Master Brogy!
We'll avenge you!</font>

468
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Usopp!</font>

469
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Beat those guys beyond recognition!</font>

470
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Send them flying far away from here!</font>

471
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah! I will!</font>

472
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They spoiled the old giant guys' duel!</font>

473
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Do you really have 
the highest bounty in the East Blue?</font>

474
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My, how Navy Headquarters'
standards have fallen!</font>

475
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whoa! That hair is weird!</font>

476
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Shut your mouth!</font>

477
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's a burning number three!</font>

478
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Shut it!</font>

479
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Break this pillar first, Luffy!</font>

480
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We're about to turn into wax figures!</font>

481
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh? You're in trouble?</font>

482
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nope. No trouble here.</font>

483
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! Your leg!</font>

484
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah. I got about 
halfway through it, I'd say.</font>

485
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How can you calmly say that's "no trouble"?!</font>

486
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Like she said, could you 
bust this pillar for us, Luffy?</font>

487
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After that, go wild.</font>

488
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah, sure thing!</font>

489
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I wouldn't be so sure.</font>

490
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dunno what it is,
but we're gonna break it!</font>

491
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh, yeah! Got it!</font>

492
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm not the same man as before!</font>

493
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hurry before we turn solid!</font>
