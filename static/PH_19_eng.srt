your captain run away from Caesar?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serves you right!
He's abandoned you to go hide somewhere!</font>

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did I hear you right?</font>

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you just insult my captain to my face?</font>

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he was just the kind of man who'd betray his crew...</font>

183
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that might honestly be easier for us.</font>

184

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end, we always have to let him have his way!</font>

188
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we have to keep on living up to his expectations,
no matter what the cost!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More than anything, Luffy hates people like Caesar.</font>

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh? Smokey?</font>

266
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's really him.</font>

267
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank god you're okay.</font>

268
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smokey!</font>

269
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have so much to talk about.</font>

270
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop fussing!</font>

271
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hatter, where is Caesar?</font>

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sent him flying down that way, along with the door.</font>

273
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder how far he flew.</font>

274
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You promised that you'd kidnap him!</font>

275
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't want to catch that guy anymore.</font>

276
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you don't want to, that was the plan.</font>

277
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you going to do if he gets away?</font>

278
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares about that guy anyway?</font>

279
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go changing our plans on your whims.</font>

280
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shouldn't have trusted you with this.</font>

281
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going after him!</font>

282
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We turn back time a little.</i></font>

283
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>In the sky near Punk Hazard...</i></font>

284
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When this mission is finished, so is he.</font>

285
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,360
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Donquixote Pirates
Servant/Assassin, Baby 5</font>

286
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll finish him off when I get back.</font>

287
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,360
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Weapon Fruit,
weaponized-body human</font>

288
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard, Joker!</font>

289
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He killed my precious fiancé, along with an entire town!</font>

290
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let him live!</font>

291
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the eighth time that he's killed the man
that I've promised to marry, along with eight towns!</font>

292
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does he always have to destroy my happiness?</font>

293
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how the young master shows his love.</font>

294
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:25,160
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Donquixote Pirates
Combatant, Buffalo</font>

295
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The young master thinks of you like a little sister.</font>

296
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,160
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Spin Fruit, rotating human</font>

297
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why he destroys those towns.</font>

298
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should learn how to refuse proposals.</font>

299
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would I do that?  He needed me!</font>

300
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've fallen in love with you at first sight.
Please marry me.</i></font>

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to do something
about your habit of never turning anyone down.</font>

302
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's weird that you're subscribed to fifty newspapers.</font>

303
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lend people too much money, 
and you're talked into buying too many things.</font>

304
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much money do you owe people, now?</font>

305
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!  I owe 98 million belly.</font>

306
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my life.  Let me do what I want.</font>

307
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, okay.  Lend me two million!</font>

308
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He needs me!</font>

309
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um... When do you need it?</font>

310
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to go to the casino when we get back.</font>

311
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll get you the money
as soon as we finish this mission.</font>

312
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll complete my assigned mission, but I will definitely kill that Joker.</font>

313
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see it.</font>

314
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Punk Hazard!</font>

315
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The island is completely covered with Caesar's gas.</font>

316
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if I can blow up the gas.</font>

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!  Jump up above me, Baby 5.</font>

318
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold!  My power is like a typhoon.</font>

319
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gust: Matasaburo!</font>

320
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we wait there,
then Caesar, Monet and Vergo should come to us.</font>

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I want to hurry home
so I can play roulette at the casino.</font>

322
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did the tanker explode?</font>

323
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, something ran into it.</font>

324
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a person down there.</font>

325
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar Clown?!</font>

326
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,800
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa</font>

327
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker, this is Buffalo calling from Punk Hazard.</font>

328
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just arrived at Punk Hazard.</font>

329
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And a beaten up Master Caesar
came flying out of the island for some reason.</font>

330
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

331
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Recover Caesar's body immediately and return to Dressrosa.</font>

332
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, what about Monet and Vergo?</font>

333
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must be a reason.  Just do what he says.</font>

334
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood, Joker.</font>

335
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a fool.</font>

336
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you brats, heaven is my ally.</font>

337
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as I have Caesar, I can easily make more SAD.</font>

338
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see something move on the deck of the tanker?</font>

339
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, there's no way anyone could survive in that gas.</font>

340
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A robot?!</font>

341
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of bird is that?</font>
