00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The snow...</font>

258
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so cold, I can't move!</font>

259
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She went after them again!</font>

260
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out, Chopper!</font>

261
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cuatro Manos!</font>

262
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Four Flowers</i></font>

263
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spank!</font>

264
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami! {This line is super short but it goes from the end of a scene to the start of the next D: -Fadeout4}</font>

265
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was scary.</font>

266
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How troublesome.</font>

267
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those children are Master's precious guinea pigs,</font>

268
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and my mission is to protect Caesar and his experiment.{ Btwb: Just one of his experiments? }</font>

269
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was the one who made Mocha rebel against us?</font>

270
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?</font>

271
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those children asked us to save them!</font>

272
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of the way, you guys!</font>

273
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get going.</font>

274
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry.</font>

275
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

276
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha, just hold on a bit longer!</font>

277
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such uncivilized people.</font>

278
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Day after day, we treated them kindly,</font>

279
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and gave them a life with no problems.</font>

280
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And here you are, trying to rob us, their guardians, of the very thing that matters the most to us.{Starfish: She literally refers to them as "treasures".}</font>

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You people are just like pirates.</font>

282
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like we're on the same page.</font>

283
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you it's uncivilized.</font>

284
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop interfering with my mission.</font>

285
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sword Snow!</font>

286
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skin Sword!</font>

287
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've only been blocking my attacks.</font>

288
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why won't you attack me?</font>

289
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be honest, I didn't think I could win against you.</font>

290
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that might not be the case.</font>

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another room in the back!</font>

292
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's find the kids and get out of here!</font>

293
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it kinda cold in here?!</font>

294
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy?</font>

295
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go through that door back there!{ Btwb: Sounds like Sanji, so I changed the actor. }</font>

296
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's trying to steal the children.</font>

297
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let anyone take them.</font>

298
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charge!</font>

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why the hell are you leading them?!</font>

300
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey bro, the kids aren't here, but Pirate Hunter Zoro is.</font>

301
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's one arrogant bastard.</font>

302
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, guys.</font>

303
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull down your lower lip and make fun of him!</font>

304
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They should all slip on the snow, hit their heads and die.{ Btwb: Not a technically correct sentence, but I'll let it slide since it sounds like something Zoro would say. }</font>

305
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami and Robin are through that door.</font>

306
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in the way, so hurry up and get going.</font>

307
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, you may be an idiot, but that was some good information.</font>

308
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's go, you g...{ Btwb: Added the ellipsis since it sounds like he started trailing off. }</font>

309
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is what I want to say, but there's a beauty right here!</font>

310
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?!{These 2 sentences are said by two different people at the same time.}</font>

311
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">She's so cute! {These 2 sentences are said by two different people at the same time.}</font>

312
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are annoying! Hurry up and go on ahead!</font>

313
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But take a closer look. She doesn't look human.</font>

314
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human-faced bird?</font>

315
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a Harpy!{ Btwb: Not sure if should be capitalized... }</font>

316
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But...</font>

317
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">besides that, she's damn cute!</font>

318
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In fact, it makes her even cuter.</font>

319
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, she's sexy!</font>

320
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you weak to compliments?!{Starfish: Despite being the one who wrote this, I do not like this phrasing. Plz do something about it.}</font>

321
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, why is it snowing in here?</font>

322
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter who they are, I won't let anyone take the children away.</font>

323
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happened to my shoulder?!</font>

324
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bitch!</font>

325
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-She's a Logia!</font>

326
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn that woman.</font>

327
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A swordswoman that uses Haki?!</font>

328
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain-chan!</font>

329
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I temporarily stopped the gas from entering this room.</font>

330
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, it might leak in from somewhere else.</font>

331
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have much time.
Everyone go after the children!</font>

332
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you going to do?</font>

333
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to stay here.</font>

334
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I figured I'm needed here!</font>

335
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>
