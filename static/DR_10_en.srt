00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

134
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some legendary heroes have appeared at Tontatta!</font>

135
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their names are Usoland and Robiland!</font>

136
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say they're on their way here!</font>

137
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On top of that, they have some friends with them.</font>

138
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their names are:</font>

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffyland, Zoroland, Namiland, Sanland...</font>

140
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopperland, Fraland, and Boneland!</font>

141
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Must be Usopp!</font>

142
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did he tell such a lie?</font>

143
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, looks like I'm Zoroland.</font>

144
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Fraland! Nice to meet you!</font>

145
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! That's awesome!</font>

146
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I don't have time for this!</font>

147
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gotta get back to the Sunny!
Nami and the others are in danger!</font>

148
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think I've been telling you?!</font>

149
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Coastal waters off Dressrosa</font>

150
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

151
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Art is unstoppable!</font>

152
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blow Kung-Fu...</font>

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Art!</font>

154
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just smoke!</font>

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here I go! Weather Egg!</font>

156
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on out, Snow Clouds!</font>

157
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ew! Disgusting!</font>

158
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You turned my Clima Tact into a toy!</font>

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an insult!</font>

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did you call a super model?!</font>

161
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't say that!</font>

162
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Turned it into a toy"? Don't confuse it with a toy!</font>

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have no taste!</font>

164
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A devil fruit user that turns people into toys is within our family, but...</font>

165
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm an art-human who ate the Art Fruit!</font>

166
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You people have been turned into art!</font>

167
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Nami got defeated, too!</font>

168
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My antlers and hooves are useless!</font>

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Bone-kichi, she's trying to kidnap me!</font>

170
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know! I'm not going to let her do it!</font>

171
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But look at this.</font>

172
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My Soul Solid looks like this!</font>

173
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you whining like you're a victim?!</font>

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be happy that I made you artistic!</font>

175
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, look what you did to my submarine!</font>

176
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And to my men!</font>

177
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To avenge them,</font>

178
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what kind of artistic death should I bring to you?!</font>

179
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello? It's me! Who is this?!</font>

180
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in big trouble right now! Help us!</font>

181
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who said you could pick that up?!</font>

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this Tony-ya?!</font>

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care what's going on over there!
Listen carefully!</font>

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Is this Tra-guy?!</font>

185
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that Law?</font>

186
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, Tra-guy?! Come to the ship right now!</font>

187
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got turned into art! Help us!</font>

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm just fine!</font>

189
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, I need you to...</font>

190
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">sail the ship to Green Bit now!</font>

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to leave Caesar with you guys!</font>

192
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaat?! He asked us the impossible and hung up!</font>

193
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought he already handed Caesar-san over!</font>

194
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with him?!</font>

195
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just talked without hearing what we had to say!</font>

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he Luffy?!</font>

197
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,220
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Green Bit</font>

198
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use, Law!</font>

199
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did you call just now?</font>

200
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me back Caesar's heart already.</font>

201
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so meaningless for you to keep hanging on here.</font>

202
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your partner, Straw Hat, has already walked into the trap that I set up.</font>

203
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's now fighting in the gladiatorial contest at the Colosseum.</font>

204
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tough contenders from all over the world
come to fight in that outlaws-only, deadly competition.</font>

205
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When someone loses, it's a one-way ticket to hell.</font>

206
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll never make it out of the Colosseum alive.</font>

207
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your alliance is over.</font>

208
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law...</font>

209
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">give up!</font>

210
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,580
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa
Sanji and Kin'emon</font>

211
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go! Luffy-dono!</font>

212
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you cheering with the others?!</font>

213
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, Sanji-dono, when a man fights, he has to win!</font>

214
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burgess!</font>

215
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that it's getting interesting!</font>

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's the shrimp?</font>

217
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hawk Rifle!</font>

219
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy's going for it!</font>

220
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're quite a fighter.</font>

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't get beaten by you here!</font>

222
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a joke! You have no chance!</font>

223
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They lionized you squirts by calling you all "The Worst Generation", and it looks like it emboldened you.</font>

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you guys aren't strong enough to go across the sea that we fought on.</font>

225
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without Whitebeard, we can't expect too much from the next generation.</font>

226
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only guy who looks good is Blackbeard Teach!</font>

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?</font>

228
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I had to pick one, it's him. But anyway,</font>

229
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if you're only good enough to compete against me in my present condition, your hopeless!</font>

230
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give up being a pirate!</font>

231
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not half bad, but if Rayleigh chose a brat
of this level as the flag-bearer for the new generation,</font>

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he's not as bright as he used to be!</font>

233
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Marines showed some good insight when they squelched the most evil of the lot,</font>

234
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean Ace, of course, in the war two years ago.</font>

235
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That fool had the demon's blood in his veins!</font>

236
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think you can beat the Marine admirals and the Four Emperors, <i>and</i> surpass Roger?!</font>

237
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's absolutely impossible!</font>

238
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

239
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rocket!</font>

240
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy is flying?!</font>

241
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's an incredibly high jump!</font>

242
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on! I'm going to teach you a lesson!</font>

243
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With 30 years worth of focused anger, I'm going all out, Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

244
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is with this ice?!</font>

245
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't break it with fire or an axe!</font>

246
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But under the ice you can see all this pirate treasure!</font>

247
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This continent is made of what they call "Crystal Ice Sheet", and to break it,</font>

248
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you have to put tremendous amount of pressure on one spot!</font>

249
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Drilling Dragon Auger Spike!</font>

250
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open, Chinjao!</font>

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you fellows like that?</font>

252
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, tie those treasure thieves up and dump them into the sea!</font>

253
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, Boss!</font>

254
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True happiness!</font>

255
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:16,820
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Happo Pirate Navy's 12th Leader

256

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This room of ice contains everything of my life.</font>

257
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joys and sorrows from the past.</font>

258

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Several decades worth of my family's treasures!</font>

260
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My drill head is the only key to the room.</font>

261
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can invade this place! Not even the Marines!</font>

262
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chinjao! I'm going to break that head of yours today.</font>

263
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,850
