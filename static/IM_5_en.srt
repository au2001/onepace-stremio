1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad. It's too dangerous here!</font>

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Inferno Floor sure is hot.</font>

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden! Please, wait a second!</font>

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't fight him just yet!</font>

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from here!</font>

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be affected by the Warden's poison!</font>

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?</font>

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I'd almost gotten to where that nice smell was coming from, too!</font>

9
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Straw-chan! You can't fight him!</font>

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Magellan, the Warden of Impel Down!</font>

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's got the power of the Doku Doku Fruit!</font>

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Doku: Poison</i></font>

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run away! This guy's too much for you to handle!</font>

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doku Doku? So he's a poison man.</font>

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rookie I hear has caused trouble wherever he's gone,</font>

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has opposed both Navy HQ and the World Government, and has a 300 million beli bounty.</font>

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never dreamed that man would break into the legendary, impenetrable prison.</font>

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As the Warden, this is very disgraceful for me.</font>

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know what you've come here for.</font>

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to free your brother, the commander of Whitebeard's Second Division, Portgas D. Ace!</font>

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After capturing you, I'll take my time with you to learn just how you managed to break in here.</font>

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I had hoped I could be of more help to you...</i></font>

25
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd die before telling you that!</font>

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan! Magellan's entire body is poisonous!</font>

27
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll be in huge trouble if you so much as touch him!</font>

28
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think you stand a chance against a man like him?!</font>

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back to the Cauldron of Blood where we were before, and turn right!</font>

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan, just give up on the food, and let's make a run towards Level Five!</font>

31
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That won't work!</font>

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stairway leading to Level Five is guarded by a Head Jailer and three Demon Guards!</font>

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already sealed off all escape routes from this floor!</font>

34
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter where you try to run...</font>

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you can't escape!</font>

36
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! No way!</font>

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydra!</font>

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is all of that poison?!</font>

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A huge cluster of poison?!</font>

41
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Warden Magellan! We're still here!</font>

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he doing to his own allies?!</font>

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Hydra's made of a paralyzing nerve-poison!</font>

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excruciating pain spreads through your entire body, and eventually kills you!</font>

45
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts...! Hurry, give me the antidote!</font>

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away from me!</font>

47
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get in the way of my attack, you fools!</font>

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please forgive me!</font>

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm so hungry!</font>

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've still got your appetite, even now?!</font>

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're definitely not normal, Straw-chan!</font>

52
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, it might be impossible to run away from Magellan!</font>

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try following me now!</font>

55
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm on fire! {oo-oo-oh, I'm on fire~~}</font>

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I beat one of its heads!</font>

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is as far as you'll go!</font>

58
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chloroball!</font>

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put on your gas masks!</font>

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep out of the center!</font>

62
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Warden is fighting!</font>

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tear-and-sneezing gas?</font>

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, it's Magellan's poison gas!</font>

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he fighting down here?!</font>

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's his opponent?</font>

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe that intruder they were talking about?</font>

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Releasing poison gas in the depths of Hell? This is serious!</font>

69
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? My eyes are itchy, and I can't stop crying!</font>

70
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whad da hell? I cad't...</font>

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I cad't figdt lige dith!</font>

72
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whad?!</font>

73
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The dragon stopped!</font>

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Venom Road!</font>

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I touch him, I'm done for...</font>

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He melted the stone wall!</font>

77
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're next!</font>

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must save Ace...!</font>

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end, you and your brother Ace...</font>

80
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...will suffer the same fate!</font>

81
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There'll never be a better chance than now, when Magellan is fighting Straw Hat!</font>

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're insane, you flashy bastard!</font>

83
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you see how many enemies there are?!</font>

84
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not about how many there are! Listen closely!</font>

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They want to prevent Straw Hat from going to the lower levels,</font>

86
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so they've got the Demon Guards guarding the entrance to Level Five!</font>

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the easiest escape-route!</font>

88
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we let this chance go, the net will only close in on us!</font>

89
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the best way out!</font>

90
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat is bound to lose eventually!</font>

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to get back up to Level Three before that happens!</font>

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may be right...</font>

93
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I haven't heard anything about Assistant Warden Hannyabal having any Devil Fruit-powers...</font>

94
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I blow the rest of 'em away with the Muggy-Ball,</font>

95
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we might be able to handle him!</font>

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

97
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get ready!</font>

98
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough of this infernal floor!</font>

99
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go.</font>

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've just gotta force our way through!</font>

101
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!</font>

102
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal-sama! It's Buggy the Clown and Mister Three!</font>

103
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're trying to get back to Level Three!</font>

104
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them get away!</font>

105
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Muggy...</font>

106
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle...</font>

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

108
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, pull back!</font>

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

110
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stamp!</font>

111
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan is capable of silencing the prisoners in the world's greatest prison...</font>

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the ruler of Hell...</font>

113
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see some determination, Bon Kurei!</font>

114
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry!</font>

115
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what I do, I can't win!</font>

116
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't stand a chance at winning!</font>

117
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm running away! Sorry!</font>

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, Straw-chan!</font>

119
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still have no intention of giving up?</font>

121
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll break Ace free and get out of here!</font>

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way I'm gonna die before I get to him!</font>

123
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let Ace be executed!</font>

124
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that steam?</font>

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm doomed to lose because you're poisonous and I can't touch you,</font>

126
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I'd rather touch you and...</font>

127
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">give up my arms to beat you!</font>

128
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't want those arms,</font>

129
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I'll grant your wish and take them!</font>

130
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

131
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Bazooka!</font>

132
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh, what a pain.</font>

133
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you'd just passed through and caused a ruckus up above, I could've blamed the Warden!</font>

134
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporting in from Level Three Archway.</font>

135
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've suffered some casualties from the escapees' bomb attack.</font>

136
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, we've captured Buggy the Clown and Mister Three.</font>

137
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told them they could go through, yet they still attacked me!</font>

138
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Freaking morons!</font>

139
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So strong! I never expected him to be that strong!</font>

140
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Hannyabal...</font>

141
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to be tortured...</font>

142
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm to be tortured, I'd rather bite off my tongue right now...</font>

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'n godda bide id!</font>

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll bide id!</font>

145
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll weally bide id!</font>

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really impossible to stand up to him?</font>

147
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't dream of such reckless things.</font>

148
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I go over there, the odds of getting killed are 200%...</font>

149
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm running away!</font>

150
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No looking back!</font>

151
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no option... But to run!</font>

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think you could bring me to my knees...</font>

153
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A cornered mouse is a frightful thing.</font>

154
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter, the poison covering your arms will be more than enough!</font>

155
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're suffering, aren't you? How shameful.</font>

156
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

157

159
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet...</font>

161
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,480

162
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

163
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mist...?</font>

164
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison Cloud!</font>

165
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is your eyesight growing blurry?</font>

166
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are your ears ringing?</font>

167
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both your hands must be useless by now.</font>

168
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison will take everything away from you before long!</font>

169
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, guards!</font>

170
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me the truth!</font>

171
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's going above us isn't it?</font>

172
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No. Nothing at all.</font>

173
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stamp!</font>

174
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's quite enough, isn't it?</font>

175
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second!</font>

176
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydra!</font>

177
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give Ace...</font>

178
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">back!</font>

179
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your punishment.</font>

180
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After exposure to this much poison, no antidote will save you.</font>

181
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will agonize for 24 hours...</font>

182
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and then you will descend to the <i>real</i> Hell!</font>

183
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace...!</font>

184
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, Warden Magellan.</font>

185
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the fallen Straw Hat Luffy?</font>

186
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll die soon enough.</font>

187
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you leave him there, he'll just be in our way.</font>

188
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw him into the central chamber of Level Five.</font>

189
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

190
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden Magellan!</font>

191
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got trouble outside the stairway to Level Three!</font>

192
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

193
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have the details yet...</font>

194
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

195
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

196
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy's done for.</font>

197
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's either dead, or he's preserved for the future.</font>

198
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-My fingers...</font>

200
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My fingers won't move...</font>

201
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't feel anything in 'em, either...</font>

202
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got frostbite, huh? Then you won't last much longer either.</font>

203
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, they're just mocking us.</font>

204
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't even eat the bread they feed us.</font>

205
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Hey, check this out!</font>

206
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A new one got thrown down here.</font>

207
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's your name?</font>

208
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How big's your bounty, new guy?</font>

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too late for this one.</font>

210
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's received the poison punishment.</font>

211
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is the meaning of this?!</font>

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal! How could you let all your troops fall as you stood by?!</font>

213
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up, Hannyabal!</font>

214
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened here?!</font>

215
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden! Please let me go!</font>

216
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm so sorry! I let my guard down!</font>

217
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to be tortured!</font>

218
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Goumon: Torture</i></font>

219
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Asses stink!</font>

220
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Koumon: Anus</i></font>

221
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn that Okama bastard!</font>

222
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He abandoned us!</font>

223
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The culprit was an Okama using Kenpo.</font>

224
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess you could say he caught us by surprise...</font>

225
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spare me the excuses!</font>

226
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's climbed the stairs and escaped to the upper levels, I presume?</font>

227
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoner was a member of Crocodile's organization, Baroque Works.</font>

228
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man who calls himself Mister Two...</font>

229
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I mean, an Okama.</font>

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What difference does it make?</font>

231
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was imprisoned on Level Three.</font>

232
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It should only be a matter of time before they catch him.</font>

233
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the commotion on Level Two?</font>

234
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems to have finally calmed down.</font>

235
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send all the soldiers gathered here up to Level Three!</font>

236
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have Sadi-chan take command and release the Demon Guards!</font>

237
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll take care of the rest.</font>

238
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well. What about these two prisoners?</font>

239
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do whatever you want.</font>

240
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hurry and clean up this mess. Get Impel Down back to normal!</font>

241
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will now seclude myself again.</font>

242
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diarrhea, huh?</font>

243
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! You guys, get up, and look for the last escapee!</font>

244
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir. Right away!</font>

245
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Umm... What do we do with these two?</font>

246
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I've got something I wanna ask them.</font>

247
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send them to the interrogation room.</font>

248
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll handle them myself.</font>

249
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

250
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll leave you alone then, Assistant Warden.</font>

251
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saved us!</font>

252
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We managed to avoid torture!</font>

253
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well, what do we do now?</font>

254
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ain't it obvious?</font>

255
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to hurry and...</font>

256
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">save Straw-chan before it's too late!</font>

257
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Save him?</font>

258
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you hear the soldiers? He was poisoned by Magellan and thrown down to Level Five!</font>

259
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no hope for Straw Hat now!</font>

260
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd just die like dogs!</font>

261
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care if I die like a dog, an Okama or whatever!</font>

262
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The second I turned my back on Straw-chan and Magellan, I forfeited my own life!</font>

263
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I ran away, I made a pledge; "Rather than dying in vain here and now, I'll run away,</font>

264
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:44,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and as long as you survive, I'll come back and save you even if it kills me!"</font>

265
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't mind you making a pledge or whatever,</font>

266
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:54,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but why would you go and risk your life again now that you've finally escaped?</font>

267
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because he's my friend!</font>

268
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's all the reason I need!</font>

269
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your... friend?</font>

270
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're gonna save Straw-chan, we've gotta do something about the poison first!</font>

271
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it! We need an antidote!</font>

272
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be easy to get something so valuable.</font>

273
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it's probably too late already...</font>

274
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

275
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is something I have to do!</font>

276
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me! Please don't die, Straw-chan!</font>

277
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

278
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I mean... What do you mean, you can't make an antidote?</font>

279
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one who's fought Warden Magellan and been exposed to his multi-layered poison has survived.</font>

280
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We might be able to counteract one of them, but there's no way to cure someone of <i>all</i> of his poisons!</font>

281
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you dare to call yourselves medical specialists?!</font>

282
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you kidding me?!</font>

283
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is, don't try to fool me!</font>

284
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just do something!</font>

285
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been decided that we're to hand
Straw Hat Luffy over to the Navy alive!</font>

286
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But injecting him with random antidotes might just hasten his death.</font>

287
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm afraid he's beyond saving...</font>

288
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I said we couldn't save Straw Hat!</font>

289
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no antidote for him.</font>

290
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all out of options!</font>

291
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd take a miracle to go up against that guy and live to tell the tale.</font>

292
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A miracle?</font>

293
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it! Just the person we need is here in Impel Down!</font>

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Okama Queen, Iva-san!</font>

295
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's saved people whom doctors deemed incurable...</font>

296
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and rescued all the inhabitants of a country on the verge of death!</font>

297
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary, ultimate Okama star, Iva-san!</font>

298
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to go and find him quickly!</font>

299
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-san... Who's that?</font>

300
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,500
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Staff Stairway</font>

301
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're going to Level Five?</font>

302
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

303
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've sentenced these two to freeze down there.</font>

304
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep moving!</font>

305
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, we've got no choice but to go!</font>

306
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me, Straw-chan!</font>

307
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this list of prisoners bothers me...</font>

308
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

309
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Ivankov...</font>

310
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of the great Okama Queen, Iva-san, has been crossed out.</font>

311
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could he have been released already?</font>

312
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or was he sentenced to death?</font>

313
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was this prisoner released?</font>

314
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Oh, Ivankov...</font>

315
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A few years ago, he was, you know...</font>

316
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

317
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten, Assistant Warden?</font>

318
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right. That. That thing.</font>

319
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I take it you know what he means? Let's hear it.</font>

320
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With the prisoners here...?</font>

321
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just say it!</font>

322
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The disappearances that sometimes happen within Impel Down.</font>

323
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nothing like an escape.</font>

324
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prisoners who can't even move suddenly vanish, without leaving a single trace.</font>

325
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Demon's Tug.</font>

326
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone is afraid of these unnatural disappearances,</font>

327
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and because some think they might've been dragged into the world of demons,</font>

328
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it has earned the name Demon's Tug.</font>

329
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People just...</font>

330
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vanish?</font>

331
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I hadn't heard that story.</font>

332
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can say that again.</font>

333
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so cold!</font>

334
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And they haven't even opened the doors yet!</font>

335
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even through all these clothes we're wearing!</font>

336
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here.</font>

337
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful of the cold and the Army Wolves.</font>

338
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, as usual, I'll take your things.</font>

339
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What things?</font>

340
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your weapons and your coat.</font>

341
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

342
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, we really can't compare to you.</font>

343
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You keep saying "I'm gonna show the prisoners how tough an Assistant Warden I am",</font>

344
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so you go through the Frozen Hell half-naked and unarmed!</font>

345
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of us guards really admire you!</font>

346
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-?!</font>

347
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And of course, we can't have the prisoners walking around in warm clothes...</font>

348
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They took his coat-</font><font size="20"></font>

349
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

350
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care, now!</font>

351
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep in mind, Snail Phones don't work out in that cold!</font>

352
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful!</font>

353
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

354
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... can't control my hands properly in this cold...</font>

355
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's cold! It's so cold, it hurts!</font>

356
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">J-Just a little more...!</font>

357
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got them off!</font>

358
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did it!</font>

359
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">1, 2, 3, 4...</font>

360
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you d-don't think those're the Army Wolves, do you?</font>

361
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you k-know why these things aren't up on the Accursed Beasts Floor?</font>

362
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, why?</font>

363
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I k-k-k-know...</font>

364
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's b-b-because if they were let loose on Level Two, they'd eat the Basilisk, the Sphinx and all the other beasts!</font>

365
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're that strong?!</font>

366
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they're a whole new level of savagery?!</font>

367
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First they take our coats and force us to suffer the cold, and now we've gotta face the Army Wolves?!</font>

368
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I'm quivering even more than before...</font>

369
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then let's get ready to fight 'em off!</font>

370
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna save Straw-chan!</font>

371
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna get eaten, dammit!</font>

372
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're running away already?!</font>

373
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got one unusual fellow here...</font>

374
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They need us to get his time of death or something?</font>

375
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts...</font>

376
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I wanna go save Ace!</i></font>

377
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It is as futile as a single ant jumping into a storm. {need to check this! I thought I used hurricane here. I am almost certain, unless it was changed post-edit. I will check within a day. skip this line, please. -kae}</i></font>

378
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You might get cast aside without even a chance of doing anything.</i></font>

379
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit wasting your breath.</font>

380
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After being poisoned that badly, there's no way you'll survive.</font>

381
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like you can't see. Can you even hear me?</font>

382
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just accept your death.</font>

383
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! I won't die!</font>

384
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... refuse to die...</font>

385
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until I've saved Ace...!</font>

386
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna save someone else?</font>

387
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't even save yourself, ya know.</font>

388
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They got a friend of yours locked up in here or somethin'?</font>

389
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ridiculous. In prison, you only look out for yourself.</font>

390
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nobody gonna save ya...</font>

391
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody'll ever come to save ya...</font>

392
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all on our own here.</font>

393
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get thrown into the sea of fire, and you gotta step on other prisoners to get back up.</font>

394
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you meet the beasts, you grab whoever's nearby and use them as bait to protect yourself.</font>

395
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try to help someone else, and you'll end up dead yourself!</font>

396
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So stop raving about wanting to rescue anyone!</font>

397
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're makin' me sick!</font>

398
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey look, someone's coming.</font>

399
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't look like surveillance or staff...</font>

400
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that guy?</font>

401
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's naked...</font>

402
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan... I'm here to save you...!</font>

403
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the name of our friendship...!</font>

404
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this guy?</font>

405
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's covered in blood.</font>

406
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back there, I...</font>

407
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry I ran away!</font>

408
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you know this guy?</font>

409
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm his friend!</font>

410
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan, I won't let you die!</font>

411
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He left the keys...</font>

412
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Breaking out, huh? I'd never even considered it...</font>

413
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to hurry and find Iva-san!</font>

414
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-san?</font>

415
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I know where that damn Okama went?</font>

416
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you, anyway?</font>

417
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Ivankov...</font>

418
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he was here a while back.</font>

419
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't he dead now?</font>

420
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that look?</font>

421
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the point of searching for someone who's not here?</font>

422
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nevermind that, how'd you get out of the cage?</font>

423
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me out too, okay?</font>

424
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm looking for someone named Iva-san.</font>

425
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, you listening?</font>

426
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, can you hear me?!</font>

427
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use.</font>

428
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guys in that cell have all frozen to death.</font>

429
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh...</font>

430
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard you.</font>

431
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to know about that damn Okama, Ivankov, right?</font>

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know something?</font>

433
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look over there.</font>

434
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can see the forest, right?</font>

435
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

436
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a jailer's room over there that no one uses anymore.</font>

437
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen a weird guy coming out of there a few times.</font>

438
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

439
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you think I'm lying, go see for yourself.</font>

440
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mention it.</font>

442
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, isn't the wolves' den out in that forest?</font>

443
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, really?</font>

444
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A gate to the underworld?</font>

445
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Demon's Tug? What the hell is that supposed to mean?!</font>

446
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't accept such a stupid reason for Iva-san's disappearance!</font>

447
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never met him, but people say he's performed countless miracles.</font>

448
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I believe he's still working miracles here!</font>

449
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-san is the God of the Okama world!</font>

450
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you! Save Straw-chan's life!</font>

451
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there's no antidote to this poison,</font>

452
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then you're the only one who can save him!</font>

453
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can only have faith and keep searching!</font>

454
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, crap!</font>

455
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan?!</font>

456
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you...</font>

457
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">doing...</font>

458
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to Bon-chan...?!</font>

459
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away...</font>

460
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">from Bon-chan!</font>

461
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Straw-chan!</font>

462
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What...</font>

463
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was...</font>

464
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that...?</font>

465
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Time left until Ace's execution...</i></font>

466
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>26 hours.</i></font>
