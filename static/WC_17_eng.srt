00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And some seaweed from the kitchen
is a substitute for his afro.</font>

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, it's done.</font>

133
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! It looks just like Brook!</font>

134
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely!</font>

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can switch him out with this thing...</font>

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she won't realize that we've taken Brook away!</font>

137
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, if we place Brûlée
 right on the mirror,</font>

138
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we can come and go through it freely.</font>

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I'll make them pay for this!</font>

140
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it's all set now. Let's begin.</font>

141
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Brook Rescue Mission!</font>

142
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'm gonna try!</font>

143
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful, Chobro!</font>

144
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know! You can just count on me!</font>

145
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot!</font>

146
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was scary! <i>Really</i> scary!</font>

147
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay, Chobro?</font>

148
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody else should try.</font>

149
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'll try next.</font>

150
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it!</font>

151
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook... Brook, wake up.</font>

152
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook, wake up now.</font>

153
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no! The snot bubble's coming!</font>

154
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

155
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did she notice...</font>

156
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Staaare...</font>

157
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's staring right at me...</font>

158
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that...</font>

159
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...a stuffed bunny?!</font>

160
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not gonna work!</font>

161
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's just a stuffed bunny.</font>

162
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? That worked?</font>

163
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now's your chance, Carrot!</font>

164
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do it this time...</font>

165
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that fly still here?</font>

166
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an annoying fly!</font>

167
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was scary! <i>Really</i> scary!</font>

168
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh.</font>

169
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we need someone else to try.</font>

170
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How disappointing.
I guess when it comes to things like this,</font>

171
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I</i> must be the one to do it!</font>

172
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

173
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wake up!</font>

174
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

175
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's rolling over!</font>

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's good for us.</font>

177
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom isn't holding him anymore.</font>

178
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'll try!</font>

179
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook, wake up!</font>

180
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

181
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, Brook!</font>

182
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ghost!</font>

183
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still here?</font>

185
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no!</font>

186
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You annoying fly!</font>

187
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heavenly...</font>

188
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feuer!</font>

189
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

190
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">We did it!</font>

191
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That... That was close.</font>

192
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Jinbe!</font>

193
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mission: Successful!</font>

194
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yahoo!</font>

195
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">– This is great!
– I'm so relieved!</font>

196
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

197
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,800
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="50"><font color="#000000">Outside

Sweet City</font></font>

199
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like he created quite a ruckus.</font>

200
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is it for him!</i></font>

201
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're currently holding Straw Hat Luffy
and the Cat Burglar captive-nasu.</i></font>

202
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He fought against one of their
top officers all night to get this far!</i></font>

203
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So his body is–</i></font>

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

205
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you said you'd be waiting for me right here!</font>

206
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you, Luffy?!</font>

207
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

208
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y...</font>

209
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y...</font>

210
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y...</font>

211
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You startled me!</font>

212
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A...</font>

213
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A...</font>

214
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A...</font>

215
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And all of this happened!</font>

216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, <i>you're</i> the one who startled <i>me<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

217
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A ghost!</i></font>

218
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You screamed at a very bad time!</font>

219
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much.</font>

220
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, you're alive.
That's all that matters.</font>

221
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I thought I was going to die!</font>

222
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I <i>am</i> dead...</font>

223
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should've realized
when I saw their heavy security...</font>

224
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just how impossible it would be for us
to get a copy of the lode poneglyph.</font>

225
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I pushed it,
and put your life in danger.</font>

226
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

227
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying?
Everything you did was for us!</font>

228
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like you said before,</font>

229
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since we were infiltrating them as a two-man team,
it was a golden opportunity.</font>

230
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we had attempted to steal Big Mom's lode poneglyph at any other time,</font>

231
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there would've been no way
to avoid an all-out pirate war!</font>

232
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why we had to <i>try</i>,
even if the odds were stacked against us.</font>

233
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here are the rubbings.</font>

234
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, anyway, Pedro-<i>san</i>,
I can't believe you got away safely too.</font>

235
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubbing...?</font>

236
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

237
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so desperate for ideas that I couldn't
come up with anything but that decoy plan...</font>

238
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, Brook! Don't tell me this is...</font>

239
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are the poneglyph rubbings.</font>

240
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was such a close call!</font>

241
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when I'd finished with the third sheet,</font>

242
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom herself burst into the room!</font>

243
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You actually got it?!</font>

244
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were against all those guards,
and there was even a sweet commander there...</font>

245
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and yet, you came out with Big Mom's poneglyph,</font>

246
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">something that any of the other emperors
would kill to have?!</font>

247
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really...</font>

248
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, yes.</font>

249
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– What?!
– What?!</font>

250
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He stole our poneglyph?!</font>

251
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

252
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is amazing!</font>

253
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a miracle!</font>

254
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Big Mom's family members are not easily
permitted access to the treasure repository.</font>

255
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really something!</font>

256
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, if I could just see your panties–</font>

257
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit it!</font>

258
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His bones got broken again!</font>

259
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's one of our goals out of the way!</font>

260
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we have to do now is take Sanji and run!</font>

261
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

262
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither of them are there?!</font>

263
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

264

267
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not here anymore.</font>

268
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not even in Sanji's room?!</font>

269
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Correct, there's some weird guy sleeping in there.</font>

270
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah. I think I might know where they are.</font>

271
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's outside, and there are no mirrors there.</font>

272
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This morning, Luffy and Sanji-<i>kun</i>...</font>

273
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">fought at this place.</font>

274
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

275
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy and Sanji had a fight?!</font>

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, why?!</font>

277
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji has his position in the Vinsmoke family.</font>

278
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

279
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must have had a very good reason to come here.</font>

280
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think it'll be so easy to take him back!</font>

281
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, if we want to retrieve him,
we had better do it soon.</font>

282
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was going to tell you once the whole group
was together, but I might as well tell you now.</font>

283
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that ceremony begins tomorrow,</font>

284
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it will be anything but ordinary!</font>

285
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

286
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys came here with Pekoms, didn't you?</font>

287
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Pekoms!</font>

288
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he all right?
We got separated from him on our way here!</font>

290
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's fine.
But there was a conspiratorial plot</font>

291
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that nearly succeeded in having him fed to some sharks.</font>

292
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A plot?</font>

293
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we hadn't spotted him,</font>

294
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he would be dead now.</font>

301
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How pathetic.
Barmaids shouldn't pass out from drinking.</font>

302
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish they would've sent us
that girl from Sanji's crew.</font>

303
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah! That girl named Nami, right?! I would've
loved to have a nice, headstrong girl like her here.</font>

304
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that Big Mom has taken her prisoner.</font>

305
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe we can negotiate a trade tomorrow.</font>

306
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, that's enough drinking for tonight.
We can have our real party tomorrow night!</font>

307
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With the backing Emperor Big Mom,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will soon get our revenge</font>

310
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">on the hateful countries of the North Blue
who have insulted and scorned us.</font>

311
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tomorrow will be the celebration!</font>

312
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:48,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose that failure and shame of the Vinsmokes
turned out to have his uses after all.</font>

313
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true! Sanji was our bait,
and we were able to catch a big fish using him!</font>

314
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When our enemies see Big Mom's flag
on Germa's fleet, they'll lose all desire to fight.</font>

315
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can conquer the seas
with greater power than ever before.</font>

316
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We ought to thank Sanji.</font>

317
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank Sanji?</font>

318
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,730

355
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all:</font>

356
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I insulted the captain of my own ship,
who came all the way here to help me.</font>

357
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then I did my best to hurt him,
even though he didn't fight back at all.</font>

358
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means...
I cannot go back to the ship now.</font>

359
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Second:</font>

360
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damn geezer who saved my life,
along with the home where I grew up,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I cannot escape from this wedding.</font>

365
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Third:</font>

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My evil biological family

376

377
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can't...</font>

378
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,150

379
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:16,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For those three reasons,
I can't go back with you guys!</font>

380
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you understand, get lost.</font>

381
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,190
