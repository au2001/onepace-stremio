00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, while we thought you were responsible for Iceburg's assassination,</font>

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Thank goodness!</font>

136
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your stuff crossed our minds, so we seized it all.</font>

137
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry about that.</font>

138
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright! Thank you!</font>

139
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's good.</font>

140
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, we're coming in.</font>

141
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're back.</font>

142
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Chopper.</font>

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Robin-chwan~!</font>

144
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was heavy wasn't it? Now please, right this way...</font>

145
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

146
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I went and checked on the Franky Family's wounds,</font>

147
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I didn't let Robin out of my sight!</font>

148
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good work!</font>

149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already told you I'm not going anywhere.</font>

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You promise?</font>

151
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promise.</font>

152
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look you two, my orange trees were okay.</font>

153
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All our money and stuff is back!</font>

154
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

155
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we can continue our voyage!</font>

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay! That's great!</font>

157
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feeling super you guys?! Everybody...</font>

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not everybody is around... Well, whatever...</font>

159
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, what are you up to all of a sudden?</font>

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen!</font>

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have something important to tell you.</font>

162
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's an island, constantly at war...</font>

163
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this out of nowhere?</font>

164
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just come in and start talking, if it's not an apology then we're not listening.</font>

165
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Be quiet and listen.</font>

166
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since the war started, if a person were to try living on that island under that rain of shells.</font>

167
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people would die, the town would die. They'd be cremated with their ruins.</font>

168
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was something still standing, a sturdy tree.</font>

169
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what happened, it wouldn't fall.</font>

170
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People gathered near the tree and built a city... and a country.</font>

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are only a few in the world.</font>

172
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of that strongest tree is...</font>

173
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Treasure Wood Adam.</font>

174
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A tree?</font>

175
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A tree? What about it?</font>

176
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In our routes, having even a piece of that tree show up is extremely rare.</font>

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted it but...</font>

178
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an item that costs 200 million.</font>

179
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't get my hands on it.</font>

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what appeared before me but a group of pirates carrying a ton of money, you guys.</font>

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you! You used our money to buy something like that, didn't you?!</font>

182
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just let me finish!</font>

183
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A long time ago, I decided I would never build a ship again.</font>

184
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But before long, to catch up to a man I admired, and to reach my own goal,</font>

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I drew up the blueprints for a ship...</font>

186
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dream is to use that treasure wood and just one last time...</font>

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make a ship, able to sail any sea. I'm going to make a Dream Ship.</font>

188
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already have the wood, and the blueprints. With this I can make it.</font>

189
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, when it's done...</font>

190
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you all sail in the ship I created?!</font>

191
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then...?</font>

192
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you mean you'll give us that ship!?</font>

193
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

194
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If people who I like are sailing it.</font>

195
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what will make me happiest.</font>

196
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's something I was only able to make because of your "investment" after all.</font>

197
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only ship that ever sailed around the world,
Gold Roger's Oro Jackson, was made from this wood.</font>

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll definitely...</font>

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show you an amazing ship.</font>

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't be helped, you and Tom-san are the same after all.</font>

201
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like a carpenter...</font>

202
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true, now...</font>

203
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I can understand how Tom-san felt when he died with his pride.</font>

204
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really a good guy! We'll take it! Thank you Franky!</font>

205
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Onto the next island!</font>

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great! Luffy! We've got a ship!</font>

207
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad, we were found out this quickly, and Luffy's still sleeping!</font>

208
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to let them know fast!</font>

209
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

210
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's them... they're here to capture the pirates.</font>

211
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though they're the heroes who saved Iceburg's life.</font>

212
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look over there!</font>

213
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Vice-Admiral Garp's warship from Headquarters.</font>

214
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you say Garp?</font>

215
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't he the legendary marine who cornered Gold Roger countless times?</font>

216
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is such an amazing marine...</font>

217
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad for the pirates.</font>

218
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The... sea?</font>

219
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap, was it the other direction?</font>

220
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait a second officers. There's no one but our president back-</font>

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop blathering! There should be pirates back here.</font>

222
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We said there aren't!</font>

223
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait you can't!</font>

224
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, over there the Straw Ha-</font>

225
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

226
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two, wait here.</font>

227
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yessir!</font>

228
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?</font>

229
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?</font>

230
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you the Straw Hat Pirates?</font>

231
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There're some men here who want to meet Monkey D. Luffy.</font>

232
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy?!</font>

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up!</font>

234
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

235
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts! It hurts!</font>

236
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"It hurts"? What are you saying? That was a punch. For it to hurt a rubber man-</font>

237
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no defense against a fist of love.</font>

238
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard you've been acting pretty recklessly...</font>

239
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy.</font>

240
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G- G- G-</font>

241
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa?!</font>

242
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now Luffy,</font>

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you think you owe me an apology?</font>

244
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,730
<font face="impress bt" size="39"><b>Marine HQ Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
"Garp The Fist"</b></font>

245
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Garp... isn't that the name of that marine hero!?</font>

246
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, is your grandpa really...?</font>

247
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is, don't try fighting him.</font>

248
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was almost killed by grandpa tons of times in the past.</font>

249
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on now, don't start speaking ill of me.</font>

250
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I tossed you into that bottomless ravine,</font>

251
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And left you alone in the jungle at night,</font>

252
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And tied you to balloons and sent you flying into the sky,</font>

253
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of it was to make you into a strong man!</font>

254
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I've just seen part of what gave Luffy his endless will to live...</font>

255
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end I left you with a close friend to continue your training with Ace.</font>

256
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And while you were out of my sight this has happened...</font>

257
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did all that to forge you into a strong marine!!!</font>

258
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always told you that I wanted to be a pirate didn't I!?</font>

259
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were corrupted by that "Red Hair"!</font>

260
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nonsense!</font>

261
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I- I owe my life to Shanks!</font>

262
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't insult him!</font>

263
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you mean to tell your own Grandpa what to do?!</font>

264
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

265
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emergency! Luffy was caught by the Navy!</font>

266
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

267
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad, if we try to fight they'll jump right on top of us!</font>

268
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fell asleep?!</font>

269
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what do we do now?</font>

270
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never been in a situation like this!</font>

271
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh oh, I fell asleep...</font>

272
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up Luffy!</font>

273
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that how you act towards someone scolding you?!</font>

274
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all, where do you get off speaking like that to your grandpa?!</font>

275
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh whatever, just do what you want...</font>

276
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Luffy's Grandpa is a Headquarters Marine?!</font>

277
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is getting crazy.</font>

278
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I-It huuuuurts...</font>

279
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you even know what level of Pirate that "Red Hair" you keep going on about is!?</font>

280
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shanks? And the guys?</font>

281
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are Shanks and everybody doing alright? Where are they!?</font>

282
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether they're fine or not...</font>

283
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With as many pirates out there now as there are stars,</font>

284
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like Whitebeard, he is one of the four great pirates!</font>

285
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who rule over the latter half of the Grand Line as if they were emperors.</font>

286
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We call them the Four Emperors!</font>

287
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to reign in these four men, Marine HQ and the Seven Warlords of the Sea were assembled.</font>

288
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These three great powers form a delicate balance that keeps peace around the world from crumbling.</font>

289
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really get it, but if he's fine then okay.</font>

290
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, this brings back memories...</font>

291
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is his connection with Red Hair?</font>

292
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy said that he asked him to take care of that straw hat for him.</font>

293
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know he was such an amazing person.</font>

294
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over here, Zoro-san!</font>

295
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, the marines are already here!</font>

296
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please go on ahead.</font>

297
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really...</font>

298
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really sorry we tried to mug you!</font>

299
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it. Thanks for showing me the way.</font>

300
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Later.</font>

301
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? What is going on?</font>

302
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the bounty head, the pirate hunter Zoro.</font>

303
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Luffy's crewmate right?</font>

304
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He seems to be pretty tough.</font>

305
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heh, you two, try and stop him!</font>

306
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yessir!</font>

307
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kukuri knives huh? You're using something pretty unusual.</font>

308
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Zoro wait! There's no reason to fi-</font>

309
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...! Why you!</font>

310
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shave!</font>

311
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That technique...</font>

312
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sergeant Major!</font>

313
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sergeant!</font>

314
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, you're no match at all.</font>

315
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're as strong as I thought. Just what I'd expect.</font>

316
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lost.</font>

317
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san, Zoro-san.</font>

318
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been a while.</font>

319
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know who I am?</font>

320
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who?</font>

321
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, Coby!</font>

322
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you remember?</font>

323
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coby?</font>

324
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coby?!</font>

325
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coby is my friend but... but the Coby I knew was a lot smaller.</font>

326
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm that Coby!</font>

327
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That same cry-baby good-for-nothing Coby.</font>

328
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?!</font>

329
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Coby... why is he on the Grand Line?</font>

330
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still not used to being a commissioned officer but,</font>

331
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I heard the two of you were nearby, I couldn't resist coming to see you.</font>

332
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It's because of you two that we've become who we are!</font>

333
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,470
<font face="impress bt" size="39"><b>Marine HQ Sergeant Major
Coby</b></font>

334
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,510
<font face="impress bt" size="39"><b>Marine HQ Sergeant
Helmeppo</b></font>

335
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'll give you that much.</font>

336
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A lot has happened... right now we're being trained by Vice Admiral Garp at headquarters.</font>

337
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what happened?</font>

338
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But man, there's a limit to how fast you should grow up, you surprised me.</font>

339
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were a bit rounder back then too.</font>

340
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be pretty tired after the incident, sorry to disturb you.</font>

341
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine. It's been a while, so let's make it a party!</font>

342
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second! You guys!</font>

343
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't recognize me at all did you?!</font>

344
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

345
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me! M-E!</font>

346
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No idea, who are you?</font>

347
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The answer is...</font>

348
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Helmeppo.</font>

349
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Morgan's son, Helmeppo.</font>

350
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the man who almost drove you to the death penalty, Roronoa Zoro!</font>

351
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really now, stop joking around.</font>

352
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't have you bullying people now.</font>

353
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem cheerful for a corpse, Roronoa Zoro.</font>

354
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

355
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm that idiot who rode on his father's fame!</font>

356
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? That was you?</font>

357
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

358
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, there was a guy like that... that was you?</font>

359
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it... I still can't forgive these guys, Coby!</font>

360
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be avoided Helmeppo-san, you can't dodge your past.</font>

361
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was it?</font>

362
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was it.</font>

363
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, you guys.</font>

364
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir!</font>

365
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fix this wall.</font>

366
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you did that yourself...</font>

367
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want us to fix it, then why did you even break it?</font>

368
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Entering that way is cooler.</font>

369
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't break things for a reason like that!</font>

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine, if you want us to fix it, then you need to help too.</font>

371
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright.</font>

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your grandpa is pretty famous isn't he?</font>

373
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess, I don't know much about what he does though.</font>

374
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way Luffy, I heard you met your old man.</font>

375
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Dad?</font>

376
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean by dad?</font>

377
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do I have a dad?</font>

378
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that? So he didn't introduce himself then?</font>

379
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard he saw you off at Loguetown!</font>

380
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's father was in that town?</font>

381
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is my dad like?</font>

382
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what Luffy's father is like...</font>

383
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of your father is...</font>

384
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Dragon.</font>

385
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a revolutionary.</font>

386
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dragon?</font>

387
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The revolutionary Dragon had a son!?</font>

388
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san is that Dragon's kid...</font>

389
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means... that Dragon is Vice-Admiral Garp's kid...</font>

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is up with this family?</font>

391
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've heard Dragon's full name!</font>

392
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey guys, why is everyone so...</font>

393
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! You don't know who Dragon is!?</font>

394
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your father is a completely outrageous man!</font>

395
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Robin...</font>

396
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I explain this...</font>

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates wouldn't usually try by themselves to disrupt the government or marines...</font>

398
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there is currently a power that is trying to directly oppose the World Government.</font>

399
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would be the Revolutionary Army. And the man at it's center would be Dragon.</font>

400
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now throughout the world this ideology is being spread.</font>

401
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Encouraging countries to overthrow their monarchies.</font>

402
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Countless countries have already fallen.</font>

403
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected, the World Government was upset,</font>

404
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And has labeled the puppet master Dragon the most dangerous criminal in the world,</font>

405
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have been constantly pursuing him but...</font>

406
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They couldn't find even a trace of where he had come from.</font>

407
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was a mysterious man...</font>

408
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet...</font>

409
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet...?</font>

410
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I probably shouldn't have said all that.</font>

411
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So...</font>

412
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget all that!</font>
