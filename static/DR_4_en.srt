142
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, who should I start with?</font>

143
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell? It's like an army!</font>

144
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not fair! They're teaming up!</font>

145
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't call something like that a battle royal!</font>

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to see you try to call us cowards after you die!</font>

147
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There will be only one winner! All we need is the result!</font>

148
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like we have some competitors who have teamed up and are fighting together!</font>

149
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that allowed?</font>

150
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not very sportsmanlike, but I don't remember it being against the rules.</font>

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man behind such a trick must be...</font>

152
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Dagama, a tactician of the Prodence Kingdom.</font>

153
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We the Prodence Kingdom will take home the Flame Fruit.</font>

154
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our king - Elizabello II was born to be a weapon of destruction!</font>

155
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A punch that is thrown from his naturally gifted physique is terribly powerful.</font>

156
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He blew a hole in an enemy country's fort with a single blow, shaking the earth!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="45" color="#000000">King of Prodence
The Fighting King
Elizabello II</font>

158
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, his power has one drawback.</font>

159
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It takes an hour to increase his concentration and warm up to throw a punch.</font>

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can only use it once per battle!</font>

161
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say his "King Punch" could even take out one of the Four Emperors if it hit them.</font>

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His victory depends on his timing!</font>

163
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King-sama, how is the preparation going?</font>

164
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna take a while. Guard me.</font>

165
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you wish!</font>

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need you guys to earn your salt!</font>

167
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protect the king and cut down the number of the competitors in the ring!</font>

168
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

169
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it okay, Lepanto?</font>

170
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the captain of Dressrosa's army to help a tactician from another country?</font>

174
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,830

175
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That makes my ears burn.</font>

176
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh shit! I'm gonna fall!</font>

177
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three competitors were eliminated by being thrown out of the ring!</font>

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And of course, in the water outside of the ring...</font>

179
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Colosseum's famous creature!</font>

180
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them!</font>

181
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A school of Little Fighting Fish!</font>

182
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't matter if you're in or out of the ring! It's Hell!</font>

183
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one can survive uninjured!</font>

184
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Corrida Colosseum!</font>

185
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't hit me like that!</font>

186
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,070

190
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're showing your back to me!</font>

191
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You cowards!</font>

192
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="45" color="#000000">Abdullah & Jeet</font>

193
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Cowards"?</font>

194
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like the sound of that!</font>

195
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you stupid Fish-Man!</font>

196
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you participating in a human competition, monster?!</font>

197
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, fish!</font>

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poor man.</font>

199
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

200
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are a puppet who can't speak with words of its own.</font>

201
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us converse with our fists!</font>

202
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a good idea!</font>

203
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? It's not moving!</font>

214
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come closer. It's boring when you're so far away.</font>

215
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,860

216
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you try attacking his legs, then?!</font>

217
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible! We can't get close to him!</font>

218
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,730

224
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's pretty strong. Do you know him?</font>

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's test his skill!</font>

230
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

231
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,830

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at him!</font>

241
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,680

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

255
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll kill them!</font>

256

262
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,420
