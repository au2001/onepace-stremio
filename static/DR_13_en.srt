<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go look for Luffy-senpai, so please give me your autograph!</font>

259
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll look for him?</font>

260
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks.</font>

261
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

265
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just wait for a bit.</font>

266
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it costs me my life, I'll find him!</font>

267
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna risk your life?</font>

268
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn...</font>

269
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

270
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She just won't go down!</font>

271
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Rebecca's specialty, the Backwater Sword Dance!</font>

272
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Become strong, Rebecca!</font>

273
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Using her opponents momentum, she brings them close to the edge of the ring.</font>

274
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With her back to the Fighting-Fish infested water,</font>

275
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and her amazing speed, she uses her opponent's strength to push them in the water!</font>

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is it!</font>

277
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Backwater Sword Dance!</font>

278
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, in all her previous matches,
she has never directly harmed a single person!{"Attacked" is the wrong word to use here. Sure, her attacks merely consist of pushing people into water, but she's still ATTACKING. -Starfish}</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's never taken an attack from anyone either!{Isis: she's receiving a lot of attacks, maybe it was meant a " hit" :)}</font>

283
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's dropped every opponent out of the ring!</font>

284
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's the undefeated woman!</font>

285
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's really good!</font>

287
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her fighting style is not unbeautiful,</font>

288
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and to be honest, I don't dislike it! {Xemnas: He's struggling with himself cause he likes her fighting style but hates her, so I used double negatives to show this. Did steal the double negative idea off CR though.}{Cecil: It fits really well :D}{I'm just annoyed that they left out the "translation" the manga did, where the lines were written out as like "Her fighting style is not unbeautiful! (It's beautiful.) I don't dislike it! (I like it.)" I totally expected them to add subtitles for that just to maintain the joke. Preferrably with a little "DING"-sound. Because I find it funny when some random silly caption appears with a little "DING"-sound. But they did not. Truly this is the worst anime ever. -Starfish}</font>

289
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But how will she go with this competition!?</font>

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With powerhouses gathered from all over the world and their varied fighting styles, {Fragment. Removed the '!' and added the ',' -Swashy-B}</font>

294
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Next!
Is Contestant Sai from the Flower Country here?</font>

297
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just carried our Grandpa in there,
and he hasn't come out yet!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you mean Contestant Chinjao?</font>

299
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Grandpa die?</font>

300
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What's going on?</font>

301
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut it, you damn martial artist!</font>

302
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our Grandpa is practically indestructible, but he's getting pretty old.</font>

303
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he's lying dead in there,
then just tell me that he's dead!</font>

304
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so noisy.</font>

305
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're being too dramatic.</font>

306

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has already left the treatment area.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is an exit at the back of the hospital room...</font>

308
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so after he was treated,
he wouldn't come back this way.</font>

309
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I see. Sorry for the disturbance.</font>

310
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you understand? Well then, come on in.</font>

311
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry I misunderstood. I was wrong.</font>

312
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can I ever make up for this?</font>

313
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See, I'm on my knees! Please forgive me!</font>

314
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mind him.
His feelings tend to get the better of him.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... I see.</font>

316
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Contestant Sai from the Flower Country, yes?</font>

317
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

318
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us begin the operation.</font>

319
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

320
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next.</font>

321
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this? A toy?</font>

322
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mountain of toys?</font>

323
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Toys and warriors.</font>

324
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's there?!</font>

325
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're... Hajrudin?!</font>

326
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're... all of you here?</font>

327
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gramps! You're alright!</font>

328
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a relief.</font>

329
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see nothing to be relieved about, you clown!</font>

330
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like all the losers of this tournament
are thrown down here.</font>

331
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

332
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is the meaning of this?! Where's the exit?</font>

333
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really think there'd be one?!</font>

334
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard Doflamingo tricked us.</font>

335
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This means war, Elizabello-sama.</font>

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed. But I can't believe that
my King Punch is ineffective against this wall.</font>

337
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're underground, you know.</font>

338
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, these walls are the earth itself.</font>

339
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how strong your punches might be,
you can't break through these walls.</font>

340
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he hoping to accomplish by trapping us here?</font>

341
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I seriously doubt they'll treat our wounds down here.</font>

342
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unless Doflamingo has a really good explanation...</font>

343
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will curse him down to his grandchildren's generation!</font>
