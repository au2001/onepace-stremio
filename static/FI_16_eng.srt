20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

21
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For years now, it's been a struggle for fishmen and humans to create a simple relationship like ours.</font>

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason why I told you not to fight with Hody...</font>

23
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is because I didn't want you to start a reckless fight.
Don't act rashly!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you just beat up Hody, then the people of this island will see you as nothing but another heartless human.</font>

25
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead of that,</font>

26
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">please become the hero who saved Fishman Island!</font>

27
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hero?</font>

28
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't wanna!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you even know what it means to be a hero?</font>

33
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, think about the meat, right?</font>

35
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates eat meat at huge feasts,</font>

36
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but heroes have to take the meat and share it with people.</font>

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna eat the meat!</font>

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of logic is that?</font>

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine.  I'll give you meat, so just do what I tell you!</font>

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

41
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that easy?!</font>

42
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To put it simply, I'll have you help me.</font>

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as you can do that, it'll be fine.</font>

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help you?</font>

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, first Megalo and I will
intentionally get captured and infiltrate their position.</font>

46
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then, when I have their attention,</font>

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">one of you will stealthily
sneak out of Megalo's stomach.</font>

48
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From inside his stomach?</font>

49
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then you'll get the Celestial Dragons' form.</font>

50
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What form?</font>

51
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh right, Luffy was asleep,
so he barely heard a word of Jinbe's story.</font>

52
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:55,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's a very important piece of paper that
Queen Otohime risked her life to get ten years ago.</font>

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other thing we need is
the key to the King's chains.</font>

54
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stealing those things...
Do we have someone who can do that?</font>

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the theft to me.
I could do it... with Robin's help.</font>

56
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite.</font>

57
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So after you've freed the King, I'll ask Luffy-kun to help me.</font>

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then you'll make a grand entrance out of Megalo's stomach.</font>

59
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone will understand that
Luffy-kun and I are working together.</font>

60
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Princess can wait in a safe location
outside the plaza, ready to take the letter.</font>

61
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then she can escape with the King and the others,
once they have been freed.</font>

62
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While that is happening, the rest of you
will hurry to Ryuuguu Palace and release our allies.</font>

63
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once that's done, hurry back to the plaza.</font>

64
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for how you free our allies in the palace...</font>

65
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come up with something yourself.</font>

66
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That isn't a plan!</font>

67
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super-leave it to me!</font>

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got the Sunny,
so I'll be sure to come up with that something.</font>

69
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we follow this plan,
how do you think the citizens will react?</font>

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two?</font>

71
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san is respected by both the citizens of the island and the villagers from the Fishman District.</font>

72
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, if everyone sees that Boss trusts Luffy-chin with his life while they save the King,</font>

73
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I'm sure that everyone will cheer for Luffy-chin!</font>

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat.</font>

75
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama.</font>

76
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm only doing it because
you're the one who's asking, Jinbe!</font>

77
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being cheered on by everyone will just distract me!</font>

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That doesn't happen very often, after all.</font>

79
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With mermaid ladies cheering for me, I could defeat the devil himself!</font>

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks.</font>

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, it appears to be settled.</font>

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All that's left is to do it!</font>

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still worried about something?</font>

84
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we name this operation?</font>

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need a bloody name!</font>

86
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's hurry!</font>

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,090

88
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi asked him for help!</font>

89
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's come with Boss Jinbe to save this country!</font>

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

91
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sounds like you've become quite popular...</font>

92
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you shouldn't get cocky
just because you snatched the King away from us!</font>

93
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're still just human pirates!</font>

00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It certainly wasn't part of my plan

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

119
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just that, up until now you've been calling me, "Wimp."</font>

120
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I didn't know all the details.
You're not as much of a wimp as I thought you were.</font>

121
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So from now on, you're...</font>

when they are faced with trouble.</font>

124
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like that man who was insulting you.</font>

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wimp would never have the strength
to hold all of that hatred inside of themselves.</font>

126
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's exactly right.</font>

128
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My sincerest apologies.  This is all happening
because I kept the truth to myself.</font>

129
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's fine.  You should be proud.</font>

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We mustn't let the hatred get the better of us.
Those great people wouldn't want us to.</font>

131
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't tell the people on our island anything! </i></font>

132
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me. </i></font>

133
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You planted a small seed in your heart.</font>

134
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can hope that the seed
will grow and cover the island.</font>

135
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If a day comes when
everyone thinks the same way as you do...</font>

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then there would be no more strife between fishmen and humans,</font>

137
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the cycle of revenge would disappear.</font>

138
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to disrespect those long years that you endured...</font>

139
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alone day after day,
protecting that seed with your life.</font>

140
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now, we'd like your permission to help protect that seed.</font>

141
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Y-Yes!</font>

142
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you so very much!</font>

143
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not a wimp, but you sure are a crybaby!</font>

144
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!  Go get 'em!</font>

145
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken wasn't of any use at all.</font>

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was supposed to eliminate Shirahoshi.</font>

147
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hody!</font>

148
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary Mermaid Princess with her troubling power...</font>

149
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All he had to do was eliminate Shirahoshi quickly.</font>

150
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell, and now I've been played for a fool.</font>

151
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe... I should have figured it out
when you let yourself be captured so easily.</font>

152
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've really become a human-lover!</font>

153
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the type of person I hate the most!</font>

154
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger and your sworn brother Arlong
were both raised in the Fishman District with you,</font>

155
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and both of them were killed by humans.</font>

156
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But instead of avenging your brother's death, you've gone and made friends with the one who killed him!</font>

157
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've become even worse than Neptune,
you damned coward!</font>

158
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I become the king of this island,
everything will change.</font>

159
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This year's World Council Meeting will be the perfect opportunity.</font>

160
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go to Mariejoa and slaughter
all the human kings of the world.</font>

161
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then the curtain will rise on
our feared undersea kingdom!</font>

162
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll drag all the humans of the world
down to the sea floor, and make them our slaves!</font>

163
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eventually there will be no one left
to oppose fishmankind!</font>

164
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be the same in the world of piracy.</font>

165
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the pirates will grovel
in front of the New Fishman Pirates!</font>

166
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this!</font>

167
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are the faces of the pirates who know my strength.</font>

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your future.</font>

169
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, in the end I will be the one
worthy of being called Pirate King.</font>

170
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate King?</font>

171
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What can a mere ten pirates do?
A mere breath from me is enough to send you flying.</font>

172
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got one hundred thousand!</font>

173
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill them, New Fishman Pirates!</font>

174
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's one hundred thousand of them!</font>

175
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can we fight that many?!</font>

176
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible!</font>

177
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing good has ever come
from being friends with you guys.</font>

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like we may be crushed
before we even get a chance to fight.</font>

179
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"></font>

180
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"></font>

181
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crushed!?  Too scary!</font>

182
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, one hundred thousand enemies...</font>

183
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It certainly is an astonishing amount.
It's enough to make your eyes pop out.</font>

184
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then, I don't have any eyes to pop out.</font>

185
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's one hundred thousand enemies?!  Let's get it started!</font>

186
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Easy for you to say!
You're using us as human shields!</font>

187
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So my time has finally come.</font>

188
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super Armored Me!</font>

189
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, come at me from wherever you want!</font>

190
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have ten people...
so each of us have to take out ten thousand.</font>

191
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Superior numbers doesn't always mean strength.</font>

192
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like they're Navy elites or anything.  You're cowering for nothing.</font>

193
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's cowering, you shitty moss-head?!</font>

194
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are, you little nosebleed chef!</font>

195
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy...</font>

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Luffy-kun.</font>

197
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama.</font>

198
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take his 400 million head!</font>

199
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I will!</font>

200
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think I'll let you?</font>

201
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill them.</font>

202
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

203
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took out a hell of a lot of pirates without even lifting a finger!</font>

204
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Pull yourselves together!</font>

205
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  He dropped half of us in an instant!</font>

206
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fifty thousand.... just like that?!  What the hell did he do?!</font>

207
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?</font>

208
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  What happened?</font>

209
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can really do it, can't you, Straw Hat Boy?</font>

210
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat pirate did that?</font>

211
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're amazing, Straw Hat!</font>

212
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was that haki?</font>

213
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has come so far in just two years?</font>

214
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Color of the Conqueror.  He had it all this time?</font>

215
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he wasn't at least this strong,
then I'd have to become the new captain.</font>

216
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're amazing, Luffy-sama.</font>

217
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Hody, right?  I have to kick your ass.</font>

218
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you wanna go around and become the king of
some countries, then that's none of my business...</font>

219
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there's only room for one Pirate King!</font>

220
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He may have just taken out fifty thousand men...</font>

221
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but...</font>

222
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we still have fifty thousand left!</font>

223
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates won't stop until they've shattered our ambitions!</font>

224
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are our sworn enemies!</font>

225
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Jinbe...</font>

226
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is the embodiment of
the worst possible future for fishmankind.</font>

227
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One where Otohime's dreams have become reality
and we coexist with human filth!</font>

228
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  Who cares about Straw Hat?!</font>

229
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just a human, after all!</font>

230
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for Jinbe... we must kill the traitor to fishmankind!</font>

231
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, fifty thousand is going too far.</font>

232
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You took out too many.</font>

233
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?  Sorry.</font>

234
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you so fired up over?</font>

235
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna take thirty thousand.  You got that, Moss-Head?</font>

236
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut it, Mister Nosebleed.</font>

237
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our race is superior!</font>

238
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to show them that!</font>

239
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

240
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care how many thousands of you there are!  Bring it on!</font>

241
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he comes!</font>

242
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to his hand?!</font>

243
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right.  Shall we get started too?</font>

244
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let you destroy my Mermaid Paradise!</font>

245
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will they surrender, or will they be destroyed?</font>

246
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island... There are vital pieces of the world's history in this country!</font>

247
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is not something you should casually destroy!</font>

248
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so hot.</font>

249
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perfect weather for a concert!</font>

250
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An army of fifty thousand...
This is an ideal stage to reveal my surprises!</font>

251
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surprises?</font>

252
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about, Franky?</font>

253
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny's got some new weapons!  Two of them!</font>

254
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone want to try them?</font>

255
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">New weapons?!</font>

256
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you think you can protect that giant mermaid...</font>

257
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">when she's sitting out in the middle of the plaza...</font>

258
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then go ahead and try!</font>

396
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see my bombardment skills?</font>

397
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like it's got plenty of other features, too.</font>

398
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... he's supposed to be a shipwright... isn't he?</font>

405
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Keep fighting, damn you!</i></font>

406
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing... Those guys are truly amazing!</font>

407
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's only ten of them, yet they're fighting
an army of a hundred thousand like it was nothing!</font>

408
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

409

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe!</font>

411
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all getting carried away.</font>

412
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Show yourself, Kraken!</i></font>

413
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's huuuge!</font>

414
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just ten people.  Flatten them!</font>

415
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'll be the end of it!</font>

416
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!  He summoned the legendary beast,
the Kraken!</font>

417
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of the way!</font>

418
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter how strong the Straw Hats are,
if that thing smashes them they're dead for sure!</font>

419
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, it's the Kraken!  He's the captain's slave!</font>

420
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's freakishly strong!</font>

421
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time you learn how terrifying deep sea creatures can be!</font>

422
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, isn't that...</font>

423
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

424
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't hesitate.  I brought you here from the North Pole!</font>

425
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're my slave!</font>

426
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serve your master!</font>

427
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can do it, can't you?!</font>

428
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-P-Please wait!</font>

429
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Retreat!</font>

430
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Surume!</font>

431
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

432
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I made you my pet earlier.  We're friends, right?</font>

433
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it!</font>

434
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

435
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That tickles!  C-Cut it out, Surume!</font>

436
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

437
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright... Surume!  Let's get going!</font>

438
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kraken betrayed us!</font>

439
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop, Kraken!</i></font>

440
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You stupid octopus!</i></font>

441
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go get 'em, Surume!</font>

442
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me... Captain...</font>

443
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kraken, over there!</font>

444
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it, what's going on?!</font>

445
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kraken is acting all friendly with Straw Hat!</font>

446
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, Surume.
You stay here and protect Weak-hoshi!</font>

447
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe you're friends with the Kraken.</font>

448
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:38,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The relationships you have always take me by surprise!</font>

449
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

450
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uhm... I'm very pleased to meet you, Surume-sama.</font>

451
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still plenty of them left.</font>

452
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!  Let's do this!</font>
