00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad! I'm so glad!</font>

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad Nami-san is okay!</font>

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness!</font>

141
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please forgive my incompetence!</font>

142
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

143
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Why doesn't he shut up?</font>

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woman...</font>

145
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you!</font>

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

147
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?! What?!</font>

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me it's gonna stretch!</font>

149
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't reach her.</font>

150
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is our chance!</font>

151
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go help Franky!</font>

152
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

153
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It stretched!</font>

154
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

155
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It stretched.</font>

156
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder I always had that feeling.</font>

157
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's impossible!</font>

158
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

159
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Nami-san!</font>

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see her!</font>

161
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami is safe!</font>

162
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness.</font>

163
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin saved her!</font>

164
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That came out of nowhere.</font>

165
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright, Nami?</font>

166
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you so much... for helping me.</font>

167
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is definitely no good!</font>

168
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why the hell did his arm stretch?!</font>

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's only one rubber man in the world!</font>

170
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah... He's behind all this.</font>

171
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

172
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whip!</font>

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now he's nothing but a monstrous Luffy!</font>

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who the hell are you?!</font>

175
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in a hurry right now!</font>

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want?!</font>

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, we know you are.</font>

178
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're aware you have no time to lose.</font>

179
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give us a minute!</font>

180
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're our only hope.</font>

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been looking for you!</font>

182
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're the Risky Brothers, henchmen of Lola the Proposer, Captain of the Rolling Pirates.</font>

183
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to defeat Gekko Moriah, don't you?</font>

184
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you?</font>

185
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know the secret to Moriah's ability.</font>

186
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll grant you insurmountable power!</font>

187
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So please beat him for us.</font>

188
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Secret? Power?</font>

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you say?</font>

190
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I'm asking you: what's on your mind?!</font>

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Allow me to introduce her.</font>

192
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Captain of the Rolling Pirates, Lola the Proposer.</font>

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her current total of proposals is 4,443.</font>

194
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My! I like you.</font>

195
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marry me.</font>

196
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

197
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He rejected her!</font>

198
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the 4,444th person who's rejected her!</font>

199
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, we're part of the group of victims that have been stripped off their shadows...</font>

200
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And are doomed to wander the forest.</font>

201
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I also had my shadow stolen, so I have no time to lose!</font>

202
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Straw Hat Luffy, aren't you?</font>

203
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, there's never been so much chaos in Thriller Bark before!</font>

204
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah's three servants have been obliterated and there's barely anything left of his mansion.</font>

205
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we all have been very excited since you came.</font>

206
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... rumor has it that the enemy's trump card, the Special Zombie, has been awakened!</font>

207
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We receive information via our Victim Network.</font>

208
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been without shadow for three years now!</font>

209
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't wanna keep living like this!</font>

210
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you manage to defeat Moriah, we can all have our shadows back!</font>

211
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then again, we're in trouble!</font>

212
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know Moriah's current location?</font>

213
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside his belly!</font>

214
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's inside that monster's belly!</font>

215
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! He was eaten?!</font>

216
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not it.</font>

217
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's riding in his belly.</font>

218
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Basically, unless you defeat the special zombie which has your shadow, you won't be able to reach Moriah.</font>

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's fighting your friends in the mansion's courtyard.</font>

220
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

221
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

222
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I have no time to lose!</font>

223
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to wait!</font>

224
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save the sluggish explanations for later!</font>

225
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Showing him an example is faster!</font>

226
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An example of the shadows' secret we've discovered!</font>

227
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

228
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it! Move it!</font>

229
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!</font>

230
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow?</font>

231
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, a shadow!</font>

232
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadows that are released upon feeding a zombie with salt can be grabbed with your bare hands!</font>

233
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes!</font>

234
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's all this?!</font>

235
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're stabbing me with a shadow!</font>

236
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Hang in there.</font>

237
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

238
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm losing consciousness...</font>

239
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

240
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's in!</font>

241
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well?</font>

242
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you back to your senses?</font>

243
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

244
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you use a sword?</font>

245
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not... in the very least.</font>

246
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What happened?!</font>

247
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadow which entered your body just now... is that of a skilled marine swordsman.</font>

248
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the power the shadow possesses is added to your own!</font>

249
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Furthermore, you can keep adding shadows as long as you hold on to your senses!</font>

250
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing, isn't it?!</font>

251
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can take advantage of Moriah's ability to dramatically increase your strength!</font>

252
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've caught plenty of shadows.</font>

253
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However; if you don't have a strong mind and easily go unconscious, all the power will be wasted.</font>

254
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come you have that many shadows?</font>

255
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to find our shadows, we've been desperately purifying zombie after zombie.</font>

256
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we only found shadows of people we didn't know.</font>

257
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we started capturing them instead.</font>

258
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, be sure to remember this.</font>

259
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When a shadow is put into a corpse, that corpse becomes a zombie, but...</font>

260
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When it's put into a human with a soul and mind of its own, it can't settle down.</font>

261
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your power-up will last 10 minutes, at best.</font>

262
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that, the shadow will go back to its original owner.</font>

263
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand?</font>

264
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a 10 minute match.</font>

265
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the shadows we've risked our lives to capture, will be given to you!</font>

266
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That many?!</font>

267
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog has already cleared. That means we only have 20 minutes of night left to strike.</font>

268
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, we've gotta hurry.</font>

269
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on to your senses!</font>

270
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be able to handle 20 or 30 shadows!</font>

271
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our limit is 2 or 3, at most.</font>

272
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead!</font>

273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait a minute!</font>

274
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it too soon-</font>

275
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This man...!</font>

276
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of mind does he possess?!</font>

277
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe my eyes...</font>

278
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He absorbed 100 shadows straight!</font>

279
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!</font>

280
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from our ray of hope!</font>

281
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey!</font>

282
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How are you feeling?</font>

283
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still you?</font>

284
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

285
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

286
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me.</font>

287
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power keeps... overflowing!</font>

288
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somehow... you...</font>

289
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've changed...</font>

290
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were a bit smaller before.</font>

291
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd never imagined this kid would be this strong.</font>

292
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The thirst for battle...</font>

293
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is burning inside me!</font>

294
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're ready to go!</font>

295
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, there's no time!</font>

296
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show that accursed Moriah what nightmares are all about!</font>

297
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're our last ray of hope!</font>

298
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nightmare Luffy!</font>

299
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you wait!</font>

300
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah!</font>

301
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

302
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're going the wrong way!</font>

303
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

304
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he comes!</font>

305
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bell!</font>

306
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel better now that I can stretch.</font>

307
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spear!</font>

308
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, what's going on?!</font>

309
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His attack power has greatly increased!</font>

310
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can Oars' body stretch without having a devil fruit's power?!</font>

311
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do, Moriah?!</font>

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! The real nightmare starts now!</font>

313
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold the Shadow power!</font>

314
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadow Revolution!</font>

315
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Revolution?</font>

316
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadows are bound to follow the body's orders.</font>

317
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's common sense.</font>

318
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Body and shadow will always share the same form.</font>

319
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is an inviolable rule.</font>

320
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, right now...</font>

321
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars' shadow, which should be serving its body, is being manipulated by my own shadow.</font>

322
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you tell what is happening?</font>

323
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can change the shape of Oars' shadow at will.</font>

324
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, body and shadow must have the same shape.</font>

325
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order for body and shadow to be the same, the body is forced to obey the shadow and change with it.</font>

326
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow revolution!</font>

327
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, by reversing common sense,</font>

328
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah forced Oars' shadow to stretch, and thus the body was forced to stretch as well.</font>

329
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... it's not like Oars has turned into a rubber man...</font>

330
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has become a monster that can turn into anything!</font>

331
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How convenient, for such a big monster!</font>

332
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, now it won't be easy to get near him.</font>

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soon you'll realize it's worse than rubber!</font>

334
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I make his shadow round,</font>

335
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars will do the same!</font>

336
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars Ball!</font>

337
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

338
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run away!</font>

339
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Wait a second, Master!</font>

340
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop messing with my fight!</font>

341
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for that.</font>

342
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't mean to spoil your fun.</font>

343
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here to give you a hand and nothing more.</font>

344
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, Oars, make sure to crush them one by one.</font>

345
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dangerous to get too close, Zoro!</font>

346
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where's Luffy anyway?!</font>

347
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah tricked him into going somewhere else.</font>

348
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He better be alright!</font>

349
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come?</font>

350
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a real idiot for sure.</font>

351
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?</font>

352
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if I should tell everyone, in this situation,</font>

353
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that there is another Warlord of the Sea on the island.</font>

354
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the situation is: We got to beat Luffy's zombie first, then Moriah or else we won't recover our shadows?</font>

355
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it that kind of situation?</font>

356
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it's as you say.</font>

357
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

358
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be morning anytime now!</font>

359
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what the enemy wants!</font>

360
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no choice!</font>

361
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me.</font>

362
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skeleton, you were here all along?</font>

363
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a...</font>

364
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a favor to ask you!</font>

365
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please listen!</font>

366
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, thank you very much!</font>

367
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a simple request.</font>

368
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure about this, Brook?!</font>

369
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw what happened to Franky, didn't you?!</font>

370
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not responsible if anything happens!</font>

371
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get ready, as this is very powerful!</font>

372
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dark Cloud Tempo...</font>

373
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, go ahead!</font>

374
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think I have to use Kuwagata again!</font>

375
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing more painful than an unpaid debt!</font>

376
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't hold back! Give it all you got!</font>

377
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Get going!</font>

378
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here I go!</font>

379
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slalom Vine!</font>

380
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a great shock that my bones can be seen!</font>

381
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then again, bones are all I have left!</font>

382
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here I come!</font>

383
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like an arrow of lightning!</font>

384
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lighting Bone Sword...</font>

385
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000

386
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000

387
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

388
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went right through him!</font>

389
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My shoulder was pierced!</font>

390
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's off-guard!</font>

391
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's strike again!</font>

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Mission...</font>

393
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">accomplished.</font>

394
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice job, bones!</font>

395
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two Swords Style...</font>

399
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, first of all...</font>

400
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll finish off this skeleton!</font>

401
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,320

402
