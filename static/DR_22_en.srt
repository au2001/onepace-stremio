<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My men should already be going after your wife and daughter, who carry the blood of the king.</font>

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch closely.</font>

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dressrosa's time under the Riku family is over.</font>

133
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He cut off his own leg?!</font>

134
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kyros!</font>

135
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A toy?</font>

136
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That toy just ran off with the king -<i>dasuyan</i>!</font>

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been turned into a toy!</font>

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on? Am I dreaming?</font>

139
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku! It's me, Kyros!</font>

140
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry. I've never heard that name before.</font>

141
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll forever be in your debt, strange, little toy.</font>

142
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run, Scarlett, Rebecca!</font>

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me at the promised place!</font>

144
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody knows my name.</font>

145
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must get to the red flower field.</font>

146
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett and Rebecca are waiting for me!</font>

147
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett? {Yeah seriously, what are the odds that she would just happen to get shot RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM? -Starfish} {stfu already - Sewil}</font>

148
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett!</font>

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett!</font>

150
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody's been shot!</font>

151
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Riku Royal Army again?!</font>

152
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why? Why didn't you wait for me?!</font>

153
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

154
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must have disappeared from your mind too.</font>

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both our promise...</font>

156
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and our time together...</font>

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett!</font>

158
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett, hang in there!</font>

159
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett! Scarlett!</font>

160
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett, hang in there!</font>

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know who you are...</font>

162
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but my daughter is waiting for me, 
and she's famished...</font>

163
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please...</font>

164
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me! It's Kyros!</font>

165
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please...</font>

166
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,180

167
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scarlett!</font>

168
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Scarlett!</i></font>

169
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be our parting?</font>

170
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is hell! It's too cruel!</font>

171
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With these tin arms, 
I can't even feel your fading warmth!</font>

172
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Scarlett!</i></font>

174
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

175
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

176
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Viola-sama.</font>

177
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?</font>

178
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in trouble. I can see our enemies coming at us from the first floor.</font>

179
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unacceptable! So it was just someone impersonating the young master? {His own fault for not seeing through the terrible disguise xD}</font>

180
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat and the others must be on the second floor or higher!</font>

181
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Violet's blood was on the wall!</font>

182
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad.</font>

183
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're about to be cornered into a fight,</font>

184
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">maybe it'd be better for me to launch a sneak attack on Doflamingo right now.</font>

185
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland and the others may not make it in time.</font>

186
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all pirates, huh.</font>

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I noticed it about Fraland and Usoland after a while.</font>

188
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got a problem with that?</font>

189
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used to be an outlaw myself.</font>

190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as we share a common goal, I'll happily fight alongside you.</font>

<font face="impress bt" size="45">Corrida Colosseum</font>

192
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ceiling in the Colosseum's basement is cracking!</font>

193
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even before the finals, 
hundreds of monsters were fighting here.</font>

194
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This day has taken its toll on the building.</font>

195
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burgess's attacks are the final straw!
The entire place could collapse!</font>

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surging Elbow!</font>

197

198
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't fire at us!</font>

199
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.</font>

200
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you as many times as I have to, Rebecca.</font>

201
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was I who shot and killed your mother, Scarlett.</font>

202
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! My barrier can't block verbal attacks!</font>

203
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san, I can't...</font>
