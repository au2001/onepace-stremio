<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wondered where the funniest place for you to die would be, and how it might happen.</font>

73
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still have food on your plate, Niji.
Eat all of it.</font>

74
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This? I'll just leave it. 
I'm not hungry.</font>

75
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ate tons of chocolate earlier, 
and this sauce that's poured on it looks nasty.</font>

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all sticky and gross.</font>

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm throwing this away.</font>

78
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat it!</font>

79

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is <i>aligot</i>.
It's a mixture of potatoes and cheese.</font>

98
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness, I'll clean it!</font>

99
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Potatoes strengthen the immune system

<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh...?</font>

102
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And maybe because you guys are so special,</font>

103
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the cut of meat in the <i>confit</i>

104
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,210

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, please don't, Your Highness!</font>

106
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Royalty mustn't eat food off the floor!</font>

That's disgusting!</font>

108
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's perfectly flavored, too.</font>

109

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The spirit of the poor has taken root in you!</font>

110
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop doing such a disgraceful thing!</font>

111
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't, Niji! He hasn't been married yet!</font>

112

114
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's shameful to me is
being part of this family!</font>

115
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

116
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An idiot who has no respect for food.
A man who beats a woman!</font>

117
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The arrogance of royalty that compels you
to see your servants as less than human!</font>

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything about you guys 
goes against what I stand for!</font>

119
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you're saying is the kind of
nonsense all those losers spout, Sanji.</font>

120
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never understood the way you see things.</font>

121
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Royalty operates by its own set of rules!</font>

122
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the unreasonable one!</font>

123
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right.
You're more wrong than ever.</font>

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it because of the bad influence 
from this man, Sanji?</font>

125
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom's ability to collect information
is greater than people think.</font>

126
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were working at his
restaurant until two years ago.</font>

127
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already zeroed in on its location, too.</font>

128
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like this picture was taken recently.</font>

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea restaurant, <i>Baratie<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

130
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong? You're turning pale.</font>

131
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did your spirit from earlier go, Sanji?</font>

132
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say something. Huh? Hey!</font>

133
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those?</font>

134
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are bracelets 
to prevent him from escaping-<i>bon</i>.</font>

135
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like both the Straw
Hats and Sanji himself are</font>

136
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">going to oppose this marriage-<i>bon</i>.</font>

137
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll lend you these bracelets
and tell you his weak point just in case-<i>soir</i>.</font>

138
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His weak point?</font>

139
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, only in the worst-case scenario
where you refuse to comply</font>

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will I stoop to asking you if you want us to chop his head off.</font>

141
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do anything stupid.
You know what we're capable of.</font>

142
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't ever resist.</font>

143
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give up on your friends
and accept your marriage to Pudding.</font>

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, everything will wrap up neatly.</font>

145
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What happened to your leg?</i></font>

146
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why?!</i></font>

147
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't think of any reason for you to be kind to me!</i></font>

148
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why...? Why did you?!</i></font>

149
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Because you...
have the same dream as me.</i></font>

150
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The All Blue...</i></font>

151
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is awesome, you damn geezer!
Is this the sea restaurant?</i></font>

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're gonna be busy!</i></font>

153
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We'll be fine 'cause I'm here!</i></font>

154
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, little eggplant!</i></font>

155
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're too slow, little eggplant!</i></font>

156
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm not, you damn geezer!</i></font>

157
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Fooling around with a woman again,
little eggplant!</i></font>

158
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

159
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

160
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

161
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

162
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

163
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Little eggplant!</i></font>

164
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i></font>

165
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't catch a cold.</i></font>

166
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Owner Zeff!!</i></font>

167
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thank you for all the damn things 
you've done for me over all these years!</i></font>

168
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll never forget your kindness...

169
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's have a peaceful wedding tomorrow.</font>

170
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll have lunch 
with Big Mom and Pudding today.</font>

171
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare to leave for her castle.</font>

172
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, Sanji?</font>

173
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Straw Hat... Where did he go?</font>

174
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Search for him.</font>

175
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten minutes... is long...</font>

176
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't even use haki.</font>

177
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is somebody there?</font>

178
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, help! Call a doctor!</font>

179
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stay with me!</font>

180
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! They waited until I wasn't around!</font>

181
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did she do to deserve this?!</font>

182
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They beat a woman unconscious...</font>

183
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never met such scum!</font>

184
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's your fault, Sanji.</font>

185
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yonji!</font>

186
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gave a woman of low birth
a taste of self-confidence.</font>

187
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean by that, you bastard?!</font>

188
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you want to see Niji?
Obviously, he's the one who did it.</font>

189
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me. I'll take you to him.</font>

190
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna be fine. Don't worry.</font>

191
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong? Are you coming?</font>

192
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I'm more than happy to!</font>

193
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

194
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were curious, weren't you?</font>

195
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were never allowed in here as kids.</font>

196
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">54 Type MBs. 30 Type MSTs.</font>

197
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And 21 Type MHs need to be restocked.</font>

198
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it.</font>

199
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they?!</font>

200
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you want to know what they are?</font>

201
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa 66 is feared around the world.</font>

202
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And these are its soldiers!</font>

203
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Minister Cracker!</font>

204
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cracker?! Is that him?!</font>

205
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Kingbaum?</font>

206
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you taking Straw Hat's side?</font>

207
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a good reason for it...</font>

208
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No excuse.</font>

209
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kill you all!</font>

210
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with him?</font>

211
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woman, I'm Sweet Commander Cracker.</font>

212
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch...</font>

213
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">my friend!</font>

214
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

215
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldiers of Germa 66?!</font>

216
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are they in water?</font>

217
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a bio-culture liquid.</font>

218
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They all have the same face...
Are they actually alive?</font>

219
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, human beings...</font>

220
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can be built!</font>

221
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa has been a kingdom of science
for generations.</font>

222
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Believe it or not, our father is a brilliant scientist.</font>

223
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before we were born,</font>

224
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he was part of a lawless research team
in a foreign territory</font>

225
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">where he was studying and developing weapons with the great Dr. Vegapunk.</font>

226
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was with Vegapunk?!</font>

227
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, when he was younger.</font>

228
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What Vegapunk discovered 
at that time was the presence of</font>

229
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">hereditary elements within living things!</font>

230
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was just one step away from
usurping God's place.</font>

231
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In essence, he found the blueprints of life.</font>

232
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Government saw it as dangerous
and arrested Vegapunk.</font>

233
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The research team was disbanded.
Or rather, it was absorbed by the government.</font>

234
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, our father escaped
the government's reach</font>

235
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and continued his research here in Germa.</font>

236
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The research into replicating and augmenting life itself.</font>

237
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thus leading to the birth of this secret facility!</font>

238
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all clones of
just a few talented soldiers!</font>

239
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're clone soldiers!</font>

240
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Clone?!</font>

241
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, none of them are aware of that.</font>

242
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see, Sanji?</font>

243
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Many countries are afraid of our army,
but at the same time, they wish to have it.</font>

244
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It only makes sense; 
they are mighty and subservient.</font>

245
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're programmed not to fear death
and not to turn on their masters.</font>

246
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When they die, we can just replace them.</font>

247
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It takes five years to create
a 20-year-old soldier.</font>

248
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the depot where we
keep a stock of the soldiers.</font>

249
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look. It only takes 
five years to create them,</font>

250
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they look like they've been around
for two decades.</font>

251
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it! That's enough!</font>

252
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to be sick.</font>

253
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji.</font>

254
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we heard that you became a pirate,</font>

255
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought maybe our little failure was actually growing up a bit.</font>

264
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you did was a high crime!
I'll teach you a lesson!</font>

265
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Sanji! Don't forget that we're
holding a hostage in the East Blue!</font>

266
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stealth.</font>

267
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it...
Have you taken a liking to that kitchen maid?</font>

268
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't fight back.
Otherwise, there will be blood in the East Blue.</font>

269

271
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should've told me.</font>

272
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I knew you were in love
with that kitchen maid,</font>

273
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't have messed up her face.</font>

274
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you have no problem
with that swollen face,</font>

275
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll appoint her to be
your servant right away.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it's high time 
we reestablish the hierarchy here.</font>

286
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have given you the ability. 
The rest comes down to discipline!</font>

297
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,610

299
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Prince Sanji!
– Prince Niji!</font>

300
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Ouch!</font>

305
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is Sanji weaker than the others?
He's lagging far behind the others' scores.</font>

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,140

are making excellent progress.</font>

308
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,690

309
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and their resilience and strength 
are equivalent to full-grown men.</font>

312
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be considered a failure.</font>

313
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought we successfully manipulated
the hereditary elements for all four of them.</font>

314
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But for some reason, Sanji's hereditary elements
are no different from when he was born.</font>

315
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you mean...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Sanji is nothing but a human.</font>
