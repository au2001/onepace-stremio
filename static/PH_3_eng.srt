<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

2
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really planning to cross this lake, Luffy?!</font>

3
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,580
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b><font size="48">The Burning Lands</font></b></font>

5
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yup.</font>

6
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And just <i>how</i> are you planning to cross this lake?!</font>

7
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Parts of it are on fire.  Others are frozen!</font>

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then the water temperature might be fine.
And I am quite sweaty...</font>

9
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,340

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't cross the lake,
we'll be taking a huge detour.</font>

15
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess there's no choice.  I'll handle it!</font>

16
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's do this!</font>

20
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And this fan grass will serve as oars!</font>

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have all sorts of seeds, I see.</font>

22
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How wonderful.</font>

23
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Boyn Islands were a treasure trove
of strange plants, after all!</font>

24
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whenever I entered a dangerous area, 
I managed to snag some convenient plants!</font>

25
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I survived on that island for two whole years,</font>

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,370

28
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll get left behind.</font>

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  I was the one who made that!</font>

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

31
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cast off!</font>

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the land of shaved ice!</font>

33
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Row, damn you!</font>

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wind is so strong!</font>

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it's a headwind, at that!</font>

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The extreme temperature difference
on the island causes the wind to blow.</font>

38
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The water's boiling out here.</font>

39
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we'd tried to swim, it would've been a disaster.</font>

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not really making much progress.</font>

41
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to row, dammit!</font>

42
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't get away.</font>

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you bastards!</font>

44
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out!</font>

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the centaur from before!</font>

46
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Did you decide to join my crew after all?</font>

47
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you just invite him <i>again?!</i></font>

48
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you stop asking every freak we meet to join us?!</font>

49
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,880

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's freezing... Is that you, boss? {Copy-paste from 579. Man, they sure don't get tired of flashing back to this conversation, do they?}</i></font>

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The intruders are heading your way!  Please take care of them!</font>

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something just appeared on the shore.</font>

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that his boss?</font>

58
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the emergency transmission was from him?</font>

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case,
it would be silly for him to try to attack us!</font>

60
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of them is carrying a sword.</font>

61
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the...</font>

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,140

63
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A volcanic eruption?!</font>

64
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Visiting this island...</font>

65
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">makes me feel like Akainu and Aokiji are glaring at me!</font>

66
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,790

67
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just leave!</font>

68
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire, please.</font>

69
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A river!</font>

70
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that was amazing, Smokey!</font>

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incredible!  How did you know
there was a river behind the ice, Smokey?!</font>

72
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are great, Smokey!</font>

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't notice anything at all, Smokey!</font>

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was obvious to anyone watching the water currents!</font>

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lack basic observation.</font>

76
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, don't be so familiar!</font>

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this creates a question.</font>

78
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It does.</font>

79
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The issue isn't that there's a river here...</font>

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should be asking,
was the ice blocking this current natural...{ Btwb: "floes" is not a very common word, for me at least. Also, they looked more like ice bergs or masses of ice instead of detached sheets, which is what floes are, according to what I looked up. }</font>

81
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or was it placed intentionally?</font>

82
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean...</font>

83
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">someone might have hidden it on purpose?</font>

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're saying that someone might live
on this island, in this gas cloud?!</font>

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  They'd have to wear masks all the time!</font>

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The voice we heard in the transmission definitely said the name of this island.</font>

87
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must have heard wrong, Tashigi-chan!</font>

88
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Snail Phones would die in a place like this!</font>

89
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got that right!</font>

264
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,940

270
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,200

276
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,750

277
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or maybe a freezer?</font>

278

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, now I see it!</font>

282
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a door at the other end!</font>

283
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!</font>

284

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lady!  I don't wanna go in there!  It's scary!</font>

288
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280

290
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They took me through here
when I first came to this island!</font>

291
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  Then it must lead to the exit!</font>

292
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,310

295
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,670

would be the same as abandoning you to die!</font>

326
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,360

336
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is a detached head

342
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The moment that you took him out of the cell,
you'd already lost, Sanji.</font>

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the only one here.</font>

393
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw Hat does show up, you can have his head.</font>

394
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's all you want, then you should leave!</font>

395
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those frozen people were so scary!</font>

396
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough of this place!</font>

397
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  There's a door!</font>

398
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can get out of here!</font>

399
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yay!</i></font>

400
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone in there after all!</font>

401
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm out!</font>

402
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're out!  It's freezing!</font>

403
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're out of the building!  We can go home!</font>

404
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see Papa and Mama again!</font>

405
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so cold!</font>

406
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Franky...</font>

407
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tank is here!</font>

408
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out of the way!  Out of the way!  Super-out of the way!</font>

409
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will crush anyone who's in my way!</font>

410
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I will avoid crushing flowers!</font>

411
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The just a little kindhearted, Franky Tank!</font>

412
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Super!</i></font>

413
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't tell what's the weirdest!</font>

414
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A giant raccoon dog, a winter bikini,
giant kids, a robot, or a detached head...</font>

415
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I dreaming?</font>

416
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen you before!</font>

417
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  It's the guy from Sabaody!</font>

418
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you the one who imprisoned these kids?!</font>

419
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You scum!  We're not giving them back to you!</font>

420
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you!</font>

421
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of all the atrocious fiends to run into... it's Smoker!</font>

422
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And with him is always a <i>cutie-swaaan</i>!</font>

423
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't good!  We've run into the Navy!</font>

424
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't go this way!  We'll have to find another exit!</font>

425
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry back inside!</font>

426
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly kids!  Through to the other side!</font>

427
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's gotta be a back door!</font>

428
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the Navy doing here?!</font>

429
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I know?!  Anyway, run!</font>

430
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Isn't the Navy supposed to be good?</font>

431
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose.  You can go to them!</font>

432
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  They look like gangsters!</font>

433
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're here, aren't they?!  Alone, my ass!</font>

434
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were indeed here... to my surprise.</font>

435
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldiers!  We will capture the Straw Hats!</font>

436
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's go!  Follow the Captain-chan!</font>

437
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

438
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is everyone alright?!</font>

439
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've made things <i>much</i> more complicated.</font>

440
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The warship is floating!</font>

441
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the river is floating with it!</font>

442
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is going on?!</font>

443
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let you leave this island anymore.</font>

444
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry that I said there wasn't anyone here.</font>

445
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy's bad news!</font>

446
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stand back.</font>

447
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't lay a finger on him... He'd just pull it off!</font>

448
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get him!</font>

449
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show him the power of G-5!</font>
