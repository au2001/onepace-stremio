00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, it sure is quiet here.</font>

130
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Should we really...</font>

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forward!</font>

132
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shouldn't we at least think of a plan?!</font>

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hacchin! Are you alright?!</font>

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out here, Macro! Give Hachi back!</font>

135
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, crap! It really is the Straw Hats' ship!</font>

136
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

137
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really can't get out... Well, in that case...!</font>

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Octo-Hachi Black!</font>

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like someone is inside that cage.</font>

140
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could that be Hacchin...?</font>

141
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great, Camie! There aren't even any enemies around!</font>

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must all be off having a snack!</font>

143
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys serious?!</font>

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone could tell that this is a trap!</font>

145
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone is obviously hiding in there, waiting to ambush us.</font>

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What insight!</font>

147
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I never would have considered that!</font>

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why you keep getting caught!</font>

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here! Camie, I'm okay, so you don't have to worry!</font>

150
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all black! What happened?!</font>

151
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, this is kinda my own fault...</font>

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, this is a trap, so hurry up and turn back!</font>

153
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know that I'm strong, right? So it's fine, just go!</font>

154
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice is really familiar, and then there's that unusual silhouette...</font>

155
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami, what do you think?</font>

156
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something very suspicious about him...</font>

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

158
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll know if we ask him, right?</font>

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is Arlong doing alright?!</font>

160
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Arlong?</font>

161
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, him, Choo, Kuroobi and everyone else got caught by the Navy.</font>

162
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the only one who escaped, and I'm now living out my old dream of running a takoyaki-stand.</font>

163
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong...?</font>

164
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it was you, huh? You damn squid!</font>

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

166
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're that damn squid who was with Arlong?! You're that takoyaki-seller, Hacchin?!</font>

167
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

168
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it was a while ago now...</font>

169
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami's hometown was once under the control of a nasty crew of fishmen called the Arlong Pirates...</font>

170
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami was in quite a terrible situation herself...</font>

171
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that octopus was one of the top-members.</font>

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he's an old enemy, huh?</font>

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, I took Luffy and the others along, and kicked the crap out of the whole crew!</font>

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, you're awesome!</font>

175
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y... yeah, I guess...</font>

176
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought all the fishmen were arrested by the Navy... But it seems like that guy managed to get away...</font>

177
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. You have gone through a lot...</font>

178
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, squid! Now that we know it's you, there's no way we'll save you!</font>

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But...</font>

180
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is your takoyaki really as good as I heard it was?!</font>

181
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, come on! Getting caught between your appetite and your reason?</font>

182
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How stupid.</font>

183
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean, you know Hacchin?</font>

184
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Hacchin an old friend of yours?</font>

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not our friend!</font>

186
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn the ship around!</font>

187
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-chin...</font>

188
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, Camie...</font>

189
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We never would have thought your friend was that guy...</font>

190
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

191
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't help me save him after all?</font>

192
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!</font>

193
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie! That's okay! Just turn back! This is a trap!</font>

194
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... I'll save you...</font>

195
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin, you're always saving us after all!</font>

196
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pappag!</font>

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! I never thought you guys would be such a load of unfeeling halfwits!</font>

198
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiots! Idiots!</font>

199
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for us, Hachi!</font>

201
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We definitely won't abandon you, Hacchin!</font>

202
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here we go!</font>

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie-chan!</font>

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got you now, Camie!</font>

205
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, come on, that's just pathetic!</font>

206
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we're gonna be rich!</font>

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With Hachi, who always saves you, in that state and all!</font>

208
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't get away, Camie!</font>

209
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I told you to run! Camie! Pappag!</font>

210
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you... Camie hasn't done anything!</font>

211
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Sanji-kun!</font>

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine, let's save Hachi as well.</font>

213
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi isn't that bad! Actually, he's harmless.</font>

214
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we did make a promise to Camie.</font>

215
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-Nami-swan... That firm, determined appearance is just wonderful!</font>

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami...</font>

217
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that really fine?</font>

218
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

219
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

220
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you say so, then I guess there's no choice.</font>

221
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's save the octopus as well.</font>

222
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your eyes turned into takoyaki!</font>

223
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are the preparations ready...</font>

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flying Fish Riders?</font>

225
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, we're always prepared!</font>

226
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

227
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

229
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a Devil Fruit User?!</font>

230
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?</font>

231
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn him!</font>

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

234
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I got them back!</font>

235
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! Thank you so much! I'm indebted to you!</font>

236
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro! Cut the octopus' ropes and the cage!</font>

237
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

238
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! Be careful!</font>

239
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've already sprung the trap!</font>

240
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Flying Fish Riders have you surrounded!</font>

241
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charge!</font>

242
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir!</font>

243
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin...</font>

244
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether it's from the sea, or the sky, we're ready for'em!</font>

245
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna beat'em all!</font>

246
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

247
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare for battle!</font>

248
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

249
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it... Now, while we have the chance, let's take Camie back!</font>

250
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie! Pappag! It's dangerous, so stand back!</font>

251
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them! Go, Luffy-chin!</font>

252
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, come, Flying Fish!</font>

253
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them, get them, go, go!</font>

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come!</font>

255
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

256
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, well...  Who's got the freshest fish here?</font>

257
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Him!</font>

258
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got him!</font>

259
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

260
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My turn!</font>

261
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, wait...</font>

262
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awesome!</font>

263
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoo! I'm flying!</font>

264
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's riding one of those things?!</font>

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ignore him.</font>

266
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

267
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bombs!</font>

268
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

269
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too dangerous! That was close!</font>

270
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez... If they had hit a lady with that, I wouldn't have let them live.</font>

271
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull in the sail! It'll get in the way!</font>

272
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everybody, dive!</font>

273
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood!</font>

274
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

275
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!</font>

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in the middle of a fight, so what the heck do you think you're doing?!</font>

277
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'b sowwy...</font>

278
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and why'd you two try to save him? You're Devil Fruit users too, right?!</font>

279
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'b sowwy...</font>

280
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I seem to have troubled you, too...</font>

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's even worse when we have to save all three of you hammers!</font>

282
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, don't waste my time!</font>

283
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Macro crew!</font>

284
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's get Camie back while we have the chance!</font>

285
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

286
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw! Could you give us a hand here?</font>

287
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You freed me from the ropes and the cage! Thanks, Roronoa! You're a nice guy, huh?</font>

288
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the captain's orders, idiot.</font>

289
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi!</font>

290
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!</font>

291
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys! You took advantage of the fact that I couldn't move and beat me as much as you wanted!</font>

292
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't punched you yet, Hachi! I'll finish you off with my Fishman Karate!</font>

293
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, you've got terrible luck!</font>

294
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop flappin' your mouth like that, damn it!</font>

295
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got much worse in store for you!</font>

296
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, come! I've developed a new style of Goldfish Fencing just for you!</font>

297
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The waters will be stained with blood!</font>

298
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!</font>

299
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Takoyaki Punch!</font>

300
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll let you go for now!</font>

301
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!</font>

302
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie! Pappag!</font>

303
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad, Hacchin!</font>

304
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry, Camie, Pappag! I was going to save you!</font>

305
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it, Hachi!</font>

306
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! Watch out!</font>

307
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget that this is our territory! After all, the ones who caught you in the first place...</font>

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were us, the Flying Fish Riders!</font>

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roronoa!</font>

310
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-chin!</font>

311
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to watch yourselves...</font>

312
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back. You can just leave this to us.</font>

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for everything, Roronoa!</font>

314
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really sorry for what happened back then!</font>

315
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hurt you pretty badly with my Six-Sword Style...</font>

316
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't even land a single blow, as far as I remember!</font>

317
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's right.</font>

318
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it, Chopper! Now, take this!</font>

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

320
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bullseye! Did you see that, you damn fish?!</font>

321
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, you're amazing!</font>

322
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone up for the Zero Fight?</font>

323
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Zero Fight?</font>

324
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Interesting! But isn't that move life-threatening for us too?</font>

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that you will be more than up to paying the medical fees?</font>

326
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you a million!</font>

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do it, Head! I'll go! Move, move, move!</font>

328
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A really huge guy is coming! And he's swinging a massive club...</font>

329
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't steering at all... Don't tell me that he is just going for a collision...</font>

330
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that giant hits us at that speed, the ship won't hold...</font>

331
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! You take care of the fish.</font>

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Interesting... With this size and speed, the impact will be like a small meteor!</font>

334
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not changing his course at all, just like Sanji said!</font>

335
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, he's not the only one... who can deal some damage while in the air!</font>

336
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber Balloon!</font>

337
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This'll be our dinner tonight!</font>

338
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool, you two!</font>

339
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looking at it up close, it really is big.</font>

340
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn... This crew doesn't seem like it'll go down easily.</font>

341
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I look at it, there are a lot of them flying around up there...</font>

342
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many will we have to beat before it ends?</font>

343
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna ride one, dammit! Don't think I've given up just because of what happened earlier!</font>

344
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give it up! I won't save you again!</font>

345
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?</font>

346
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up, Brook?</font>

347
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think that my first real action as a member of the Straw Hat Crew was to drown...</font>

348
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be a disgrace if I did not help you!</font>

349
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is about time we reduced the number of those Flying Fish...</font>

350
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please observe!</font>

351
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an incredible jump!</font>

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that skeleton mask guy?</font>

353
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll skewer you!</font>

354
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lullaby Song</font>

355
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flan!</font>

356
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! They all fell asleep...</font>

357
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You too?!</font>

358
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Music is... Power!</font>

359
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me!</font>

360
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We fell asleep!</font>

361
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn him, what was that?!</font>

362
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used some sort of dirty trick!</font>

363
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is no trick!</font>

364
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is music!</font>

365
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

366
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's pretty good, that Brook!</font>

367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks fun... Here I come!</font>

368
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Luffy! Not again!</font>

369
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I caught you! I won't forgive you if you dive again!</font>

370
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you're asleep?!</font>

371
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Wake up!</font>

372
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy! He went into the Head's room!</font>

373
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw it...?</font>

374
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...!</font>

375
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like you know me...</font>
