<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice job!</font>

138
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me give you a hand!</font>

139
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, I'm counting on you!</font>

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Armée de l'Air...</font>

141
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Air Force</i></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Cherry Blossom Shoot</i></font>

145
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

146
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you insist on attacking the same spot?!</font>

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it didn't work before, it won't work now!</font>

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will work.</font>

149
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pain is a signal to protect the body.</font>

150
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not having it... doesn't make you any stronger at all!</font>

151
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say whatever you want then!</font>

152
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, it's dangerous, you two!</font>

153
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away quickly!</font>

154
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

155
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it.</font>

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad.</font>

157
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

158
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

159
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

160
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another two...</font>

161
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone... is being eliminated.</font>

162
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

163
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Four!</font>

164
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five!</font>

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And only three remain!</font>

166
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only... three remain.</font>

167
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, hurry up and crush them, Oars!</font>

168
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's coming!</font>

169
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's useless!</font>

170
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't possibly win against such a monster!</font>

171
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're out of options!</font>

172
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do?!</font>

173
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

174
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll create an opening.</font>

175
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!</font>

176
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it!</font>

177
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright then!</font>

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, Usopp?!</font>

179
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

180
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

181
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

182
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Three Swords Style...</font>

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Demon Crow!</font>

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did we do it!?</font>

185
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did it work!?</font>

186
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, now is-</font>

187
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Attacking my right arm again?!</font>

188
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've told you countless times; it won't work!</font>

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get rid of you!</font>

190
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He disappeared!</font>

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

192
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Oars!</font>

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look this way!</font>

194
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

195
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something... went into my mouth.</font>

196
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, what was that?</font>

197
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did it.</font>

198
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally did it!</font>

199
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally made Oars swallow the salt!</font>

200
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salt?</font>

201
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What of it?</font>

202
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, you didn't know.</font>

203
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salt is the zombie's weakness!</font>

204
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! This is it for Oars!</font>

205
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's shadow is coming out!</font>

206
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get purified, monstrous zombie!</font>

207
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The victory is mine!</font>

208
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come out!</font>

209
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why... is Moria's shadow...?</font>

210
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm protecting him from the inside!</font>

211
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a simpleton.</font>

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Celebrating victory prematurely.</font>

213
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you actually think I wouldn't have a countermeasure for such a weakness?</font>

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

215
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

216
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think this is yours, Long-nose!</font>

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

218
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No good, the salt!</font>

219
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The salt Brook gathered for us!</font>

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Damn!</font>

221
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Making fun out of us!</font>

222
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stamp!</font>

224
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

225
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

226
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

227
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

228
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

229
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

231
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not yet!</font>

232
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smash him to pieces!</font>

233
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The same goes for the woman!</font>

234
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush them! Crush them!</font>

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush every single one of them!</font>

236
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush the ones who're already unconscious too!</font>

237
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still a bit of breath in them!</font>

238
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smash them until they're no longer recognizable as humans!</font>

239
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, big idiot.</font>

240
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think you are stomping?</font>

241
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody is under your foot.</font>

242
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

243
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... I'm...</font>

244
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was I saved?</font>

245
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what happened, but...</font>

246
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for helping us out ther-</font>

247
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

248
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

249
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Lu-</font>

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lu-</font>

251
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!?</font>

252
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which part?!</font>

253
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You somewhat...</font>

254
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You somewhat resemble him, but...!</font>

255
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really you?!</font>

256
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious!?</font>

257
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is... really me.</font>

258
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, your way of talking matches.</font>

259
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?!</font>

260
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he also have the ability to transform?</font>

261
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or...?</font>

262
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was everyone defeated?</font>

263
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes.</font>

264
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Except for us, everyone else got beaten up by that monster.</font>

265
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

266
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step aside.</font>

267
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step aside!?</font>

268
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you understand, Luffy?!</font>

269
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That zombie possesses your shadow!</font>

270
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Furthermore, his body can stretch and perform your techniques too!</font>

271
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter.</font>

272
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush them, Oars.</font>

273
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

274
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

275
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he comes!</font>

276
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rifle!</font>

277
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only Luffy...</font>

278
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is me!</font>

279
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something is flying this way!</font>

280
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

281
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rain cloud?</font>

282
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

283
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Oars!</font>

284
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it...</font>

285
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

286
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's doing it!</font>

287
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's fighting equally with Oz!</font>

288
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now is our chance! Start searching!</font>

289
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey!</font>

290
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found a member of the Crew of Hope!</font>

291
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here too!</font>

292
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a horrible wound.</font>

293
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone was beaten up badly.</font>

294
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy was beaten to the point that his bones are visible!</font>

295
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dangerous to leave them here.</font>

296
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take them somewhere safe, quickly!</font>

297
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they doing?</font>

298
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's so many of them.</font>

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they zombies?</font>

300
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're they gonna do with Zoro and the others?!</font>

301
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry back!</font>

302
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey!</font>

303
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?</font>

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars is losing!</font>

305
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe such a monster is losing.</font>

306
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, O-Oars?!</font>

307
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Have you heard?!</font>

308
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama is currently inside Oars' belly!</font>

309
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, the master of all the zombies in Thriller Bark is being beaten, along with the ultimate Special Zombie?!</font>

310
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of joke is this?!</font>

311
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars... the legendary man who 500 years ago was called a demon!</font>

312
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And our master is a Royal Warlord of the Sea!</font>

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah-sama!</font>

314
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

315
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So by stuffing Luffy with the shadows of
100 victims, you made him look like that?!</font>

316
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's correct, Crew of Hope.</font>

317
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be honest, we're surprised about how much power he has acquired!</font>

318
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... that strength will only last 2 or 3 more minutes!</font>

319
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows we placed in him will begin to leave his body!</font>

320
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sorry for messing with your captain, but...</font>

321
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've entrusted him with all of our hope!</font>

322
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want to be humans again!</font>

323
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our last hope!</font>

324
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nearly daybreak.</font>

325
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fate of all the island's victims will be decided within the next few minutes.</font>

326
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you, Nightmare Luffy.</font>

327
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mansion is breaking apart!</font>

328
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and escape!</font>

329
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really amazing.</font>

330
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

331
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Way to go, Luffy!</font>

332
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

333
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Insignificant scum!</font>

334
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

335
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bullet!</font>

336
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, Oars!</font>

337
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did Straw Hat acquire such power?!</font>

338
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

339
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I might get involved in this.</font>

340
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I better get out of the cockpit for no-</font>

341
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

342
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

343
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

344
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Battle Axe!</font>

345
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

346
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Storm!</font>

347
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars is being...!</font>

348
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama!</font>

349
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's coming down, be careful!</font>

350
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows... are coming out.</font>

351
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, is Luffy gonna be alright?</font>

352
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

353
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Are you alright?!</font>

354
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I dreaming?</font>

355
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won.</font>

356
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, the Crew of Hope has done it!</font>

357
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars and Moriah have been defeated!</font>

358
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's shadow will return!</font>

359
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark...</font>

360
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has fallen!</font>
