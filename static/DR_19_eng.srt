00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've let loose some Fighting Fish that are suitable for the finals.</font>

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're very sensitive to the smell of blood.</font>

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fly-</font>

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you guys see that?</font>

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Fighting Fish's charge?</font>

65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're heinous animals that will attack even the participants in the ring.</font>

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've got the most twisted personalities.</font>

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're on a completely different level to the Fighting Fish in the preliminary rounds.</font>

68
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bosses of each school of Flying Fish!</font>

69
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And on the back of just one of them, this tournament's prize,</font>

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Flame Fruit is tied to it!</font>

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rules of the finals are simple.</font>

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The last one standing, who manages to steal the Fruit, wins!</font>

73
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, the final battle,</font>

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a battle royale of five people, including our hero Diamante, is about to begin!</font>

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A scramble for the Devil Fruit!</font>

76
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A death match with the Fighting Fish!</font>

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who will win the Flame Fruit?!</font>

78
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now,</font>

79
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for...</font>

80
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,590

81
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're finally here.</font>

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,470
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Royal Palace Lower Section
In front of the Rampart Tower</font>

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the entrance to the palace?</font>

84
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just the palace's lower column.</font>

85
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entrance to the rampart tower.</font>

86
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a secret entrance to the Rampart Tower as well. Let's go that way.</font>

87
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful not to get discovered by the guards.</font>

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we make a fuss and the commanders find out, we won't be able to move freely.</font>

89
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Especially if we're found by Pica, we'll never reach Doflamingo.</font>

90
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm? Where's Luffy-dono?</font>

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um... there!</font>

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

93
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is that carp?!</font>

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giant...</font>

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this carp?!</font>

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it a pufferfish?</font>

97
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

98
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell are you doing?!</font>

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's open.</font>

100
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't give me that!</font>

101
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

102
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You dunce!</font>

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No choice.</font>

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, at this point, it's faster to go through the front gate.</font>

105
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can I take this off already?</font>

106
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do whatever you want!</font>

107
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, now...</font>

108
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

109
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a report from the entrance of the Rampart Tower!</font>

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's an intruder. It's Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

111
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Fighting Fish attacks, but Lucy dodges it effortlessly!</font>

112
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What great movement!</font>

113
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they on about?</font>

114
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he really the intruder?</font>

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true.</font>

116
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He destroyed the gate.</font>

117
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it can't be him.</font>

118
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat is fighting in the Colosseum under the name Lucy right now.</font>

119
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Rampart Tower B-2, in front of the dining hall!</font>

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no doubt about it, the intruders are Straw Hat Luffy,</font>

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Pirate Hunter, Zoro,</font>

122
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,450

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then who the hell is the guy in the colosseum right now?!</font>

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what is going on?!</font>

125
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,040
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Palace</font>

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened, you ask?</font>

135
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you want to know so much, I shall tell you.</font>

136
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't expect a commander be on standby in this lift.</font>

137
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was given an order to protect the Toys' House,</font>

138
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I got on the lift to go down and wait in ambush at the underground trading port.</font>

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I got on it a second time.</font>

140
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words...</font>

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G, for I <u>G</u>ot on the wrong lift!</font>

142
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you go to the palace, intruders.</font>

143
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... You will let us pass!</font>

144
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:10,390
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Royal Palace Rampart 
Tower B-1</font>

145
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy has entered Rampart Tower B-1!</font>

146
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which way?</font>

147
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Left.</font>

148
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nobody here. Just you wait, Mingo!</font>

149
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards can't keep up with us.</font>

150
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A stone monster?!</font>

152
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! It's Pica!</font>

153
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's huge! What is that thing?!</font>

154
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! He's one of the Family's top officers!</font>

155
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That stone monster?</font>

156
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pica ate the Stone Fruit and gained the power to merge with stone!</font>

157
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he's not just a stone man.</font>

158
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can merge with any stone he touches.</font>

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meaning, that since this palace is made of stone,</font>

160
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he can control the entire thing!</font>

161
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The walls!</font>

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,720
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Corrida Colosseum</font>

163
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another bloodthirsty Fighting Fish jumping out!</font>

164
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's charging at Burgess!</font>

165
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wave Motion...</font>

166
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Elbow!</font>

167
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Colosseum is shaking!</font>

168
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It blasted a massive hole in the spectator's seats! </font>

169
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burgess' powerful Wave Motion Elbow!</font>

170
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The upstart pirate, Blackbeard and the ten Fleet Captains that support him.</font>

171
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is one of them, Jesus Burgess.</font>

172
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard!</font>

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't involve the audience!</font>

174
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a destructive power!</font>

175
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, another Fighting Fish has appeared.</font>

176
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's charging toward the right.</font>

177
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

178
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's here, it's here, it's here!</font>

179
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's shown up! The one with the Devil Fruit on its back, Fighting Fish 01!</font>

180
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is.</font>

181
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it after Bartolomeo?!</font>

182
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or so we thought, before it changed directions!</font>

183
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just who is it after?</font>

184
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is Fighting Fish 01 after?!</font>

185
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, it's going after Rebecca!</font>

186
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll at least cut those chains.</font>

187
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I've got ya!</font>

188
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if I'd let you!</font>

189
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want a fight?</font>

190
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Lucy and Diamante are facing off!</font>

191
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

192
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you're up against me!</font>

193
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be the one to take the Flame Fruit!</font>

194
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take you both down at once.</font>

195
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burgess has taken his stance again!</font>

196
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

197
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's coming again!</font>

198
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sly bastard, standing behind me!</font>

199
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not gonna dodge, huh, Lucy?</font>

200
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wave Motion...</font>

201

202
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

203
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, Burgess' armor has been shattered!</font>

204
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-As expected of my Grand Senpai.</font>

205
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess you won't just give me the Flame Fruit.</font>

206
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His fighting style is different.</font>

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this guy really Straw Hat?</font>

208
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,350
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Underground Commerce Port 
Usopp's group</font>

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,930
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Current Location</font>

210
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,740

211
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is clear proof that Sugar is in the Commanders' Tower.</font>

212
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those tubes for?</font>

213
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right in the middle of that tower lies the commanders' private lift.</font>

214
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for the pipes extending all around it,</font>

215
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">big humans and broken toys are sent in through those.</font>

216
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:15,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are numerous entrances to the scrapyard all throughout Dressrosa,</font>

217
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get dropped into any one of them,</font>

218
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and you'll reach the scrapyard, located right below the Officers' Tower.</font>

219
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fed up with this! First a mountain of garbage, now this?</font>

220
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?</font>

221
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what is this slimy stuff?</font>

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was weird that they sent me to the medical room when I wasn't injured.</font>

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not "slimy stuff"! It's "Sticky"!</font>

224
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back! Who the hell are you?!</font>

225
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Officers' Tower.</font>

226
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:55,820
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Inside the Officers' Tower</font>

227
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:58,960

228
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">also has another name.</font>

229
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar! What is that other name?</font>

230
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Officers'' Tower.</font>

248
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody remembers you anymore.</font>

249

260
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I refuse to spend the rest of my life working with these creepy toys!</font>

261
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this was where they smuggled the weapons from?</font>

262
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I can't resist them! I can't do anything!</font>

263
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe they had a port underground.</font>

264
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to contact the others...</font>

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the king of Prodence! Damn you, Doflamingo!</font>

268
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will I be a toy for the rest of my life?
You can't be serious!</font>

269
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, help!</font>

270
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they are Trebol and Sugar.</font>

271
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She really is a kid.</font>

272
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

273
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She loves grapes. She's always eating them.</font>

274
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about it?</font>

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's essential to our plan.</font>

276
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this!</font>

277
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a lump of the world's spiciest seasoning, tatababasco!</font>

278
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've disguised it as a grape!</font>

279
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're giving that to Sugar?</font>

280
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to sneak it into her basket.</font>

281
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've tested it on fifty Tontattans.</font>

282
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every single one of them fainted, and twenty-eight nearly died!</font>

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've tested it?</font>

284
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The plan is flawless! We just have to make her eat this.</font>

285
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Go, Leo!</font>

286
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will watch over you!</font>

287
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so reassuring.</font>

288
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If a panic breaks out... I'm outta here.</font>

289
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Leo!</font>

290
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

291
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet, you guys!</font>

292
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out for Trebol!</font>

293
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Be careful!</i></font>

294
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're way too loud!</font>

295
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem.</font>

296
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you, prepare yourselves!</font>

297
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once Sugar screams out...</font>

298
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all the toys in this country will turn back into big humans!</font>

299
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the forgotten memories will come back!</font>

300
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With all his evil deeds exposed...</font>

301
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the pirate Doflamingo's...</font>

302
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">true nature will be revealed!</font>

303
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going. We will save our friends!</font>

304
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

305
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you to be quiet!</font>

306
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will reclaim King Riku's country!</font>

307
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

308
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh come on!</font>

309
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up already!</font>
