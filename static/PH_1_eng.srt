3
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's going so well, it's almost scary!</font>

4
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, this feels great.</font>

5
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,690

6
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Want to join in?</font>

7
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200

8
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fine.  I washed myself two days ago.</font>

9
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm more interested in that cloud that looks like cotton candy.  It looks delicious!</font>

10
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It isn't edible.</font>

11
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  You mean it isn't sweet cotton candy?</font>

12
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  There's something sweet and tasty
in the shower room?</font>

13
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true.  It really does look sweet and delicious!</font>

14
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, Nami-san!</font>

15
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,890

17
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,650

21
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will they be alright on deck without you?</font>

22
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get out of the bath
before we enter the rising currents, so it'll be fine.</font>

23
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If any sea monsters appear,
I'm sure they can handle them.</font>

24

25
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, wait just a minute!</font>

26
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're up against giant fish!
A weak rope wouldn't be able to hold 'em!</font>

27
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, you seem to be having fun.</font>

28
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think of it on the way down
because I was too excited about Fishman Island...</font>

29
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if we catch a deep sea fish and pull it up to the surface...</font>

30
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji can cook it up for us, right?</font>

31
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope it'll go well with cola!</font>

32
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cooking, huh?  Great idea!</font>

33
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,660

to celebrate our entry into the New World.</font>

34
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, which one should we go for?</font>

35
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want one that looks delicious.</font>

36
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps we should fry that one and eat it with salt?</font>

37
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fried fish with salt, huh?  Sounds great!</font>

38
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one might be nice grilled in sweet soy sauce.</font>

39
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grilled fish, huh?</font>

40
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  That looks good, too!</font>

41
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we put mayonnaise on it, it'll definitely taste nice!</font>

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Which one?</font>

43

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one will taste nasty no matter how you cook it.</font>

45
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  Well, any one will do.</font>

46
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji can cook anything and make it tasty!</font>

47
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to eat that one after all?!</font>

48
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, isn't it a bit too big?!</font>

49
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quick!  Get it!</font>

52
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We caught ourselves a deep sea fish!</font>

53
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna eat it soon!</font>

54
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, is that even a fish?</font>

55
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe it's just some old guy?</font>

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old guy?</font>

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It got turned into bait!</font>

58
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey hey hey!  Again?!</font>

59
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,290

60
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,710

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,090

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship's gonna capsize!</font>

63
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fish just keep coming!
They're like matryoshka dolls!</font>

64
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did something happen?  The ship's swaying.</font>

65
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And they're really noisy out on the deck.</font>

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess leaving them alone was a bad idea, after all.</font>

70
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's all the fuss about?</font>

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji!  Look at this!</font>

72
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,620

76
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because there are two more fish inside it!</font>

77
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,340

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's that?</font>

81
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A giant sea snake!</font>

82
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!  Move us closer!  We're gonna eat that too!</font>

83
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,240

93
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,820

94
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really bad after all!  Let's get out of here!</font>

95
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,950

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so big, he couldn't even make it through
the hole in the Red Line!</font>

135
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

136
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like a miracle.
I never thought we'd see a pod of Island Whales.</font>

137
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one has wounds on its head that look just like Laboon's.</font>

138
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  The scars are exactly the same!</font>

139
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a shock!  It really isn't Laboon?</font>

140
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to deliver Binks' brew...</font>

141
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon!  Stop!</font>

142
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to me!</font>

143
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!  I was part of the Rumbar Pirates!</font>

144
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, Brook!</font>

145
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to your senses!
I told you, that's a different whale!</font>

146
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Laboon!</i></font>

147
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to be calmly admiring them!</font>

148
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we're out of the maelstrom, we're still in danger!</font>

149
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all, we have to do a headcount to make sure nobody got thrown overboard in the vortex!</font>

150
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

151
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

152
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan!</font>

153
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here.</font>

154
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.  We've gotta get out of here in a hurry!</font>

155
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we collide with these gigantic whales, the ship will take major damage!</font>

156
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Count us too!</font>

157
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun!  It is my shame to admit that the other six crewmates have not yet received honorable deaths!</font>

158
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, what are your orders?!</font>

159
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can stay where we are.</font>

160
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, we're doing just fine, you idiots!</font>

161
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Resume whale watching immediately!</font>

162
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What the hell?!</i></font>

163
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This enormous pod of whales
is creating its own ocean current.</font>

164
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trying to resist it will just put us in more danger.</font>

165
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure the sails are open!</font>

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn the ship in the same direction that the whales are moving!</font>

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

168
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course... This must be Laboon's homeland.</font>

169
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are any of his relatives here?!</font>

170
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's dangerous, Brook!</font>

171
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anyone here is looking for a small whale
who got separated from the pod fifty years ago...</font>

172
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then don't worry!  He's doing fine,
in a sea on the opposite side of the world!</font>

173
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to Luffy-san, he has grown big and strong!</font>

174
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, don't be concerned!</font>

175
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ride the ocean current!</font>

176
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

177
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>We're going to deliver Binks's brew,</i></font>

178
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>entrusting ourselves to the whims of the ocean breeze and waves.</i></font>

179
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Beyond the tides, even the evening sun is cheerful.</i></font>

180
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>The song of birds, drawing circles in the sky.</i></font>

181
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Farewell to the port, to the old hometown.</i></font>

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Let's sing a song with a DON, a song for our departure!</i></font>

183
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>The waves of gold and silver turn to splashes of water,</i></font>

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>as we set off for the edge of the sea!</i></font>

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>We're going to deliver Binks's brew.</i></font>

186
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>We are pirates, crossing the seas.</i></font>

187
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>The sea is our pillow and the ship is our mattress.</i></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>The waves are dancing, beat on the drums!</i></font>

191
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  You're letting us ride you!</font>

192
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can let them carry us like this.</font>

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,650

197
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see it!</font>

198
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, men!</font>

209
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here!</font>

210
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>In the New World!</i></font>

211
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it!</font>

212
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We finally made it here!</font>

213
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The weather's the worst!</font>

214
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thunderclouds in the sky!</font>

215
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wind blows fiercely!</font>

216
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea is raging!</font>

217
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The compass needles are out of control!</font>

218
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

219
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yahoo!</font>

220
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

221
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  Impossible!</font>

222
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A red sea?</font>

223
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  A volcanic eruption!</font>

224
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, Luffy!</font>

225
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">None of the three compass needles point to that island!</font>

226
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an anomaly, even in the abnormal New World!</font>

227
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another eruption!</font>

228
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can see it right there!</font>

229
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares about the needles?</font>

230
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're dropping anchor, no matter what you say!</font>

231
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  We can't get any closer than this!</font>

232
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, it's a sea of fire!</font>

233
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get you!</font>

234
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fire...</font>

235
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only a matter of time before the ship catches fire!</font>

236
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

237
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny is super-fireproof!</font>

238
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it shouldn't burn,
there's something wrong with this sea!</font>

239
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, the fish are nothing but bones!  Bones!  Bones!</font>

240
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Did you call me?</font>

241
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's this?</font>

242
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snail Phone is crying.</font>

243
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong?!  Does your stomach hurt?</font>

244
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot, that's an emergency signal.</font>

245
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone's calling for help.</font>

246
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, if I pick up the phone,
we can communicate with them?</font>

247
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Luffy!  Less than fifty percent of emergency signals are real!</font>

248
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy uses this kind of trap all the time,
so that's probably what this is!</font>

249
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you pick it up and they've got the line bugged, then they'll know we're in the area!</font>

250
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good point, Robin!</font>

251
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, Luffy,
we ought to think this through carefully bef-</font>

252
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?  My name is Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

253
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,710

254
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You answered too soon, and you're saying too much!</font>

255
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, help me!</font>

256
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?!</font>

257
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's freezing... Is that you, boss?</font>

258
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'm not your boss.</font>

259
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's cold, you say?</font>

260
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My companions keep getting cut down.</font>

261
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The samurai's gonna kill us all!</font>

262
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai?</font>

263
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's your name?! </font>

264
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?!</font>

265
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter who I am, just save me.</font>

266
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm on...</font>

267
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Punk Hazard! </font>

268
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He was killed!</i></font>

269
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is this...</font>

270
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suspect foul play.</font>

271
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it's foul play!  He was just murdered!</font>

272
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New World is scary!</font>

273
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could have been acting.  It still might be a trap.</font>

274
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She keeps her composure!</font>

275
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon, Robin-san!</font>

276
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said samurai, Brook.</font>

277
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it must be one of those samurai...</font>

278
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of the swordsmen from the Wano Kingdom.</font>

279
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Wano Kingdom is an isolated nation, which never lets outsiders enter.</font>

280
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't even have any ties to the World Government.</font>

281
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently the swordsmen called samurai
are so strong, even the Navy won't approach them.</font>

282
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Named Sword Shuusui,
once wielded by a legendary samurai.</i></font>

283
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you are its master, this blade should be satisfied.</i></font>

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How frustrating, for this samurai body to fall.</i></font>

285
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A kingdom like that exists?</font>

286
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he said he was in Punk Hazard, not the Wano Kingdom.</font>

287
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he mean that flaming island?</font>

288
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he was using a Baby Snail Phone,</font>

289
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then that island is the only one within range.</font>

290
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  Let's go save that guy!</font>

291
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

292
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, think about it!</font>

293
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chances are, we're already too late!</font>

294
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai are scary!</font>

295
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared too!</font>

296
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter who I am, just save me.</font>

297
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm on...</font>

298
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Punk Hazard! </font>

299
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san, wasn't that...</font>

300
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!  What route did they take?!</font>

301
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First there was the incident on Fishman Island,
then the uproar after that...</font>

302
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and if I project their route from that point...</font>

303
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Punk Hazard, huh?  Makes sense.</font>

304
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please stop!  I'll do anything!</font>

305
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do whatever you want!</font>

306
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want you to burn!</font>

307
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

308
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you brutes!  Stop torturing the pirates!</font>

309
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tashigi!  We're heading for Punk Hazard.</font>

310
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Smoker-san, Punk Hazard...</font>

311
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has been uninhabited since it was sealed off
after the incident four years ago!</font>

312
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes no sense for people to be there!</font>

313
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, it shouldn't be possible
for any creatures to live there.</font>

314
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's worth a look, regardless.</font>

315
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're setting sail for Punk Hazard!</font>

316
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  But Vice-Admiral Smoker...</font>

317
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That place is forbidden, didn't you know that?</font>

318
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try to tell to me about the rules, scum!</font>

319
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Right!</i></font>

320
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That settles it.  The ones who'll go are...</font>

321
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Us.</font>

322
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How exciting.</font>

323
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How depressing.</font>

324
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you won?  Lucky you!</font>

325
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I lost!  Someone trade with me!</font>

326
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, have my special giant shellfish lunchbox.</font>

327
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't wait to taste it!</font>

328
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!  She made a pathway of clouds!</font>

329
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you learn to make that stuff
 they used back on Sky Island?</font>

330
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just clouds,
so you better cross it while it's stable.</font>

331
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

332
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

333
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes the scouting party!</font>

334
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you, Mini Merry!</font>

335
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, you all!</font>

336
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so lucky at drawing straws!</font>

337
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be able to go later.</font>

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care!</font>

339
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, good luck!</font>

340
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Trade places with me!</i></font>

341
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This giant shellfish is delicious!</font>

342
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, why are you eating that already?!</font>

343
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, we've climbed above the flames!  This is fun!</font>

344
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we can get past the sea of fire!</font>

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will these clouds last until we head back?</font>

346
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good thing the rain stopped.</font>

347
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perfect weather for scouting.</font>

348
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's so hot!</font>

349
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san,
does that cloud reach all the way to the island?</font>

350
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

351
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad I didn't have to accompany Luffy.</font>

352
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't stand the heat!</font>

353
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't let him go alone, after all.</font>

354
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll come back
once they see that there's nothing there!</font>

355
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've thought this through, haven't you?</font>

356
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make a cold dessert out of the giant shellfish for our kind Nami-san right now!</font>

357
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yay!</i></font>

358
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?  That's definitely the entrance!</font>

359
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now listen, people might have lived here before...</font>

360
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's no way they could live here now!</font>

361
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snail Phone must have
picked up a transmission from some distant island!</font>

362
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Robin?</font>

363
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't look pretty, but this is surprisingly tasty.</font>

364
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You too?!  Why are you eating it now?!</font>

365
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you not gonna eat?</font>

366
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't swallow anything right now!</font>

367
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I'm having an unexpected relapse
of my disease from two years ago!</font>

368
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys... Honestly,
I've got the "I can't enter that island"-disease!</font>

369
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know.</font>

370
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt about it.  This is the right place.</font>

371
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is Punk Hazard?</font>

372
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get the Merry onto the island.</font>

373
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the emergency signal
came from this place after all?</font>

374
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like it's forbidden to enter this island.</font>

375
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, look at that!</font>

376
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Danger... Keep out?</font>

377
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?  The logos of
the World Government and Navy are here!</font>

378
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So basically, even if someone is inside,
it'll be someone on the Government's side!</font>

379
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was a waste of time.  Let's go back!</font>

380
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gah, so hot.</font>

381
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!
Breaking and entering is a crime, you know!</font>

382
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh wait, pirates are criminals.</font>

383
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't blame me if you end up
in a fight with the World Government!</font>

384
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh wait, we already did that.</font>

385
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, wait!</font>

386
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so hot... But, anyway...</font>

387
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This whole place is on fire.</font>

388
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't look like this was always a burning island.</font>

389
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was there some kind of disaster?  Or an accident?</font>

390
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!</font>

391
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those probably weren't people's houses.</font>

392
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This must have been a government facility.</font>

393
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So was this place sealed off
after it caught fire and became too dangerous?</font>

394
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or was it a dangerous facility to begin with?</font>

395
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that the Log Pose
isn't pointing to this island bothers me.</font>

396
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

397
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guy from earlier, are you here?!</font>

398
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've come to save you!</font>

399
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

400
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come out!</font>

401
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai!</font>

402
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't call the murderer!</font>

403
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did your appetite return?</font>

404
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut it!  I'm drowning my sorrows!</font>

405
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, and this has been bothering me for a while...</font>

406
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guy on the Snail Phone said he was freezing, right?</font>

407
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's freezing... Is that you, boss?</i></font>

408
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got a point.
It's so hot here, yet he said it was cold.</font>

409
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he was an idiot?</font>

410
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of reasoning is that?!</font>

411
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could there be any cold places on this burning island?</font>

412
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or did he mean that he was so scared that he was getting the chills?</font>

413
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, is something wrong?</font>

414
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, the clouds...</font>

415
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sky above this island is really weird, now that I take a closer look at it.</font>

416
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It almost looks arctic on the far side.</font>

417
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's impossible!</font>

418
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A giant!</font>

419
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

420
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is way bigger than a giant!</font>

421
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that...</font>

422
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!  D-Do these things really exist?!</font>

423
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:43,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they're fictional creatures!
How could they exist for real?!</font>

424
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But just look at it!</font>

425
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What else could you call it?</font>

426
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A dragon?!</i></font>
