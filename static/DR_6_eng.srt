00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What <i>was</i> that just now?</font>

136
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?!</font>

137
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,800
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Uninhabited Forest North of Dressrosa
"Green Bit"</font>

138
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wild forest?!</font>

139
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So this is...</font>

140
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Green Bit?</font>

141
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those giant plants?!</font>

142
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Joker, it's me! Come get me!</font>

143
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be in such a rush.</font>

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there is the arranged drop point, the southeast beach.</font>

145
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will leave you there at 3 in the afternoon.</font>

146
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the beach on the other side!</font>

147
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a Marine warship?!</font>

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It got stuck on the island! It's not just beached!</font>

149
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that possible?</font>

150
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those cuts on the plants look fresh.</font>

151
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

152
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that ship hasn't been here for too long.</font>

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its body is not as damaged as it should be.</font>

154
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they make it through the water filled with the Fighting Fish?</font>

155
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only a matter of time before the Navy gets here.</font>

156
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Do they know about the trade?!</font>

157
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know that!</font>

158
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You stupid scientist, you're too loud!</font>

159
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I'm a wanted person!</font>

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since my boss, Joker, resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea,</font>

161
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not protected under any laws!</font>

162
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you leave me handcuffed on the island where the Navy is wandering, I'll...</font>

163
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said "Shh! Be quiet!"</font>

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute! Joker is just a pirate now too!</font>

165
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You look like you're hiding something.</font>

166
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a coincidence.</font>

167
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could I manipulate the Navy?</font>

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm thinking about going to Green Bit.</i></font>

169
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not proper to hand me over here! Abort this mission!</font>

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy is <i>my</i> enemy as well
since I'm allied with the Straw Hats.</font>

171
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me you set me up!</font>

172
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be here in 15 minutes.</font>

173
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You all need to take up sniping and recon positions and cover me.</font>

174
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They may be hiding. Go check the forest.</font>

175
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you find something, let me know as soon as possible.</font>

176
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, got it.</font>

177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

178
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't expect the Navy to be here so...</font>

181
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forest is dangerous! Wait!</font>

182
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's not get separated!</font>

183
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for being so manly, Usopp.</font>

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too loud!</font>

185
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't leave me!</font>

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you walk a little slower?</font>

187
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch! Don't stop so suddenly, Robin...</font>

188
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?! The Straw Hats?!</font>

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been found!</font>

190
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where?! Where are they?!</font>

191
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're wrong! I'm Leo!</font>

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Navy. Who are they talking to?</font>

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like they knew we were coming to this island.</font>

194
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you good people or bad people?!</font>

195
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're the Navy! We protect the citizens.</font>

196
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're definitely good people!</font>

197
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then hand over your weapons!</font>

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't give you our weapons! We have a mission!</font>

199
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show yourself!</font>

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! What's going on?!</font>

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see. It's too fast.</font>

202
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is with this forest?!</font>

203
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

204
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been stripped of everything!</font>

205
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mille Fleur...</font>

209
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,290

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! What did you catch?!</font>

211
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like a dwarf!</font>

212
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's in her bag?</font>

214
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A book, a notebook, and some clothes.</font>

215
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A candy.</font>

216
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Snail Phone.</font>

217
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure to take all of her weapons.</font>

218
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something suspicious under her clothes!</font>

219
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are searching her clothes!</font>

220
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No abnormalities at Point C.</font>

221

224
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's not hiding anything around Point B either.</font>

225
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Big Human has woken up!</font>

226
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go on the alert!</font>

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

228
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow!</font>

229
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try to run! Stay calm!</font>

230
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,970

232
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With my magic Stitch power,</font>

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've sewn you to the ground.</font>

234
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stitch power?</font>

235
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! I sewed you up with this needle!</font>

236
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a villainous Big Human, aren't you?</font>

237
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, but I think there's been a misunderstanding.</font>

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you a devil fruit user?</font>

239
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a Tontatta Tribe warrior, Leo!</font>

242
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is Usopp?</font>

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, the other human, where is he?</font>

244
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he okay?</font>

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The long-nosed Big Human was also captured in accordance with our kingdom's rules.</font>

246
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this place is the country of dwarves, isn't it?</font>

247
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, this is what our tribe has raised, underneath the great forest, the Tontatta Kingdom.</font>

248
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The forest? You mean Green Bit?</font>

249
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you people grow all those giant plants?!</font>

250
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! There is no plant that we can't grow!</font>

251
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out, everybody!</font>

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kabu-san!</font>

253
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This Big Human can sprout flower-like hands on the ground!</font>

254
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flower-like hands?!</font>

255
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've never grown such things!</font>

256
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it must be magic! The strangest thing I've ever seen!</font>

257
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was no time to run before she caught me!</font>

258
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Are you the one who stripped the Navy soldiers of their things?</i></font>

259
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I got hypnotized by something and they must've carried me here.</i></font>

260
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I could probably get away from here with my power, but it would only make matters worse.</font>

261
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Human! What is your objective?!</font>

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you here to destroy the Tontatta Kingdom?!</font>

263
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I'm sorry! I just caught him out of curiosity.</font>

264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the reason is,</font>

265
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we can't let anybody who has seen our Tontatta Tribe live.</font>

266
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! I wasn't going to hurt any of your people.</font>

267
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,540

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got you!</font>

401
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said! What kind of place is the Flower Field?!</font>

402
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet and keep running. I'll fill you in later.</font>

403
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let the police see you!</font>

404
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you a soldier?!</font>

405
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

406
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca.</font>

407
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw the list in the Colosseum.</font>

408
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I figured you would enter the competition.</font>

409
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you not to!</font>

410
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

411
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do it! I'll win it!</font>

412
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

413
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So...</font>

414
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then... let's live together!</font>

415
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A warrior who cries so easily cannot win a competition!</font>

416
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hurry up and go!</font>

417
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? You sure?</font>

418
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine.</font>

419
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly, now!</font>

420
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really okay?! That girl was crying!</font>

421
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why we must hurry!</font>

422
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just a toy, but I have something that I want to protect!</font>

423
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though I can't shed tears from these tin eyes.</font>

424
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,640
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Green Bit
Southeast Beach</font>

425
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The appointed time for Caesar's hand-over...</i></font>

426
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>is in two minutes.</i></font>

427
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, Law! This is Sanji!</i></font>

428
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Foot-ya huh? Did you find the factory?</font>

429
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not important now!</font>

430
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen carefully!</font>

431
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You've got to get out of there!</i></font>

432
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

433
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to hand Caesar over soon!</font>

434
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo never resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>

435
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even if you give Caesar back to him, the deal is off!</i></font>

436
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been...</font>

437
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">totally deceived!</font>

438
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't understand...</font>

439
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How...</font>

440
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You have to get off the island, now!</i></font>

441
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The news about Doflamingo was wrong?</font>

442
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean by that, Saka-san?</font>

443
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you saying the Navy Headquarters were fooled by a false report?</font>

444
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yea, it's really aggravating.</i></font>

445
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm going to go talk to the Five Elders at Mariejois.</i></font>

446
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm sorry, but that's how it is.</i></font>

447
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I need you to keep going ahead to
Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo's meeting point.</i></font>

448
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger that.</font>

449
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All units! To the southeastern beach!</font>

450
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hurry up!</i></font>

451
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool. It's too late.</font>
