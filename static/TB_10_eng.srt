<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,020

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this reindeer?</font>

56
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that Dr. Hogback?</font>

57
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the guy who was with Moria.</font>

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should I kick this guy's ass too?!</font>

59
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait a minute!</font>

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Luffy!</font>

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you leave this guy to me?</font>

62
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the doorway there, isn't it?</font>

63
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the freezer room.</font>

64
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead!</font>

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I got it!</font>

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a lack of manners, going to meet Moriah-sama without notice!</font>

67
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-chan! Get him!</font>

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One!</font>

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560

72
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,090

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Cindry-chan?!</font>

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead, Luffy.</font>

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, Robin!</font>

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Straw Hat!</font>

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hogback!</font>

78
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm disappointed in you!</font>

79
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't accept you as a doctor!</font>

80
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't recognize you, Dr. Chopper!</font>

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were a Zoan type user all along...</font>

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder I thought you were a strange creature.</font>

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea how you avoided being carried through Perona's Garden, but...</font>

84
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't be escaping this time.</font>

85
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take your shadow!</font>

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Better yet...</font>

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about I kill you here and turn you into a marionette?</font>

89
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They will do it.</font>

90
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This passage is incredibly long!</font>

91
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I'm out!</font>

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this place?</font>

93
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found you!</font>

94
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yo!</font>

95
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just you...</font>

96
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this hugeness?!</font>

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this some sort of archdemon?!</font>

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen a giant like this!</font>

99
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this a zombie?</font>

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this...</font>

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy?</font>

102
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use!</font>

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over!</font>

104
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It came to kill us!</font>

105
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he planning to do?!</font>

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This looks good.</font>

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Now I'm all set!</font>

108
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll definitely be the Pirate King!</font>

109
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was kinda surprised when the building collapsed.</font>

110
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

111
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't even notice us?!</font>

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing's speech sure resembles Luffy's...</font>

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's power certainly is dangerous when embedded in a body like that.</font>

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just...</font>

115
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget your shadows...</font>

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course not!</font>

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we give up our shadows, we haven't saved Nami-san yet!</font>

118
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull it together!</font>

119
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, getting past here is the problem...</font>

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems Usopp and I fell along with the stairs, but...</font>

121
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we try to change our route...</font>

122
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This bridge has collapsed and we can no longer go to that mast-like mansion.</font>

123
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jumping isn't an option either...</font>

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our shortcut has turned into a detour infested with zombies...</font>

125
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang on thirty more seconds!</font>

126
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not sure about this ornament.</font>

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He built a bridge!</font>

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All this rubble and wood is more than enough to build a bridge or two.</font>

129
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But despite this being an emergency, you gave it a lot of detail.</font>

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You expect me to make a shoddy job?!</font>

131
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, this is just fine.</font>

132
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, you saved us. Let's go!</font>

133
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with this room?</font>

134
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite the eye-catching type of room.</font>

135
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I planned on having the zombies on the stairs and bridge make you their prey.</font>

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think Oars would fall down.</font>

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a nosy nuisance.</font>

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those ghosts...!</font>

139
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is she... the one controlling them?</font>

140
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who the hell is she?!</font>

141
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By now, you must be aware of how terrible these ghosts are!</font>

142
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to the Hollow Fruit I'm a ghost woman, capable of creating ghosts at will!</font>

143
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These ghosts are branches of myself.</font>

144
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They empty people's hearts.</font>

145
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is it for you all!</font>

146
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe those troublesome ghosts are being controlled by that cutie-chan!</font>

147
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No time for that!</font>

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we get hit by those things, we'll be done for sure!</font>

149
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no choice but to run!</font>

150
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're certainly dangerous!</font>

151
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Negative Hollow!</font>

152
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My existence is worth less than a maggot's...</font>

153
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right...</font>

154
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I were born a stray dog...</font>

155
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't deserve to walk on the same ground as all of you...</font>

156
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all... over...</font>

157
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seize them.</font>

158
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How simple.</font>

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only the ones above remain.</font>

160
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Requiem: Type of song sung during funerals
Banderole: Horizontal fencing attack or banner</i></font>

263
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Requiem la Banderole.</font>

264
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the alias my comrades gave to that sword technique, which they praised so much is...</font>

265
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three-Pace Hum: Notch Slash!</font>

266
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although you have my personality and skills, you've lost my memories and humanity.</font>

267
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you have no right to use that name!</font>

268
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're the real one as you imply...</font>

269
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then try to overcome my fake sword skills!</font>

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your last chance...</font>

271
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three-Pace Hum...</font>

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Notch Slash!</font>

273
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon!</font>

274
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More than anything, I'd like to apologize to you...</font>

275
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has been fifty long years in this dark sea...</font>

276
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet...</font>

277
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was no point in staying alive after all...</font>

278
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So lonely...</font>

279
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My life has been...</font>

280
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So lonely...</font>

281
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First...</font>

282
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Obviously, I'll get rid of that afro.</font>

283
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

284
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mansion is shaking...!</font>

285
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What's with this shaking?!</font>

286
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows...</font>

287
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe an earthquake?</font>

288
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the laboratory?!</font>

289
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found him!</font>

290
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Skeleton!</font>

291
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been beaten up pretty badly.</font>

292
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still in this world?!</font>

293
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alive?!</font>

294
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You...</font>

295
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here...?</font>

296
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pathetic...</font>

297
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pitying the loser after his defeat!</font>

298
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on a second!</font>

299
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you...</font>

300
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary samurai who is rumored to have sliced a dragon long ago?</font>

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to meet you.</font>

302
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!</font>

303
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Wait a minute!</font>

304
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this shaking?!</font>

305
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't kiss my bride!</font>

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama!</font>

307
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

308
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you find anything?!</font>

309
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This giant ship, Thriller Bark, is being sucked into a weird current!</font>

310
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole island is shaking!</font>

311
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did this happen?!</font>

312
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like... the Special Zombie is messing with the rudder.</font>

313
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

314
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's moving! Moving!</font>

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">General Zombies!</font>

316
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Set out immediately!</font>

317
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop Oars!</font>

318
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Roger!</i></font>

319
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars!</font>

320
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's as far as you go, Special Zombie Oars.</font>

321
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Start cutting at his legs!</font>

322
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Oars?</font>

323
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gone.</font>

324
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being so huge...</font>

325
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can he move so swiftly?</font>

326
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found him!</font>

327
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Above!</font>

328
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

329
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">(Even though I'm not rubber...)</font>

330
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

331
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't interfere with my adventure!</font>

332
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Annihilated?!</font>

333
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ones who came from here?!</font>

334
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes...</font>

335
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone was crushed...</font>

336
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the ultimate Zombie Army of this island!</font>

337
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the General Zombies!</font>

338
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, in a blink of an eye...</font>

339
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible...</font>

340
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't Oars supposed to be our ally?</font>

341
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he rampaging mindlessly?</font>

342
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies are supposed to do nothing but obey.</font>

343
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we rely on such a guy,</font>

344
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no telling what'll happen to Thriller Bark!</font>

345
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-swan!</font>

346
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here to rescue you!</font>

347
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There she is!</font>

348
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Straw Hats...?!</font>

349
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing...</font>

350
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He pushed Ryuma away...</font>

351
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is he...?</font>

352
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just a wild pirate swordsman who uses the Three Swords Style.</font>

353
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's fairly strong.</font>

354
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If your pride allows it, he can take back your shadow for you...</font>

355
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you say?</font>

356
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My shadow...?!</font>

357
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really...?!</font>

358
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you... please... recover my shad-</font>

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Just be quiet!</font>

360
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton!</font>

361
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

362
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one fine blade you got there...</font>

363
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good eye...</font>

364
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This certainly is one of the 21 Large Sharp Blades...</font>

365
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A black sword with a riot edge...</font>

366
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Shusui: Autumn Water</i></font>

367
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Wicked Clove... The famous sword, Shusui.</font>

368
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An item recognizable anywhere.</font>

369
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An Large Sharp Blade, huh?</font>

370
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A splendid thing to come across.</font>

371
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I expect no less from someone calling himself a Samurai.</font>

372
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright then.</font>

373
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I can use that sword.</font>

374
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're way too cool!</font>
