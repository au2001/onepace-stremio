00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! The Navy found us already!</font>

132
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa?!</font>

133
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Vice-Admiral Garp's warship!</font>

134
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother! Don't look back, escape!</font>

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Luffy! Can you hear me?!</font>

136
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa here! Grandpa here!</font>

137
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer if you can hear me!</font>

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Grandpa! What's wrong with you?!</font>

139
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you say you weren't going to capture us here?!</font>

140
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, a lot of things happened!</font>

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry but you're gonna die in this sea!</font>

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no apology I can give you but,</font>

143
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take care of you by myself!</font>

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hand me the cannonball.</font>

145
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes.</font>

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he trying to do?</font>

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fist...</font>

148
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meteor!</font>

149
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He just shot a cannonball at us with his bare hands!</font>

150
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That flew much faster than with a normal cannon!</font>

151
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if it were a baseball pitch!</font>

152
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My power has decreased lately.</font>

153
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no choice! We'll have to escape!</font>

154
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The new ship might get blown up!</font>

155
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring 1000 more cannonballs!</font>

156
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

157
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

158
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time many more are coming!</font>

159
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Fist Meteor Shower?!</font>

160
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

161
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no ship that can withstand that when he uses it!</font>

162
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, shall we begin, kiddies.</font>

163
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Full speed ahead!</font>

164
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll smash those cannonballs!</font>

165
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

166
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! Is he really not coming?!</font>

167
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he doing?</font>

168
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's here!</font>

169
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp came!</font>

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, everyone! Usopp came!</font>

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

172
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

173
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move! Move!</font>

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please move!</font>

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move a little please!</font>

176
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nose-Bro!</font>

177
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing here?!</font>

178
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

179
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines haven't come, so why's the ship leaving?!</font>

180
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was pretty sure you were on it!</font>

181
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you guys doing?!</font>

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The great me is still here!</font>

183
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

184
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

185
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after the quarrel I was fighting alongside you all the time!</font>

187
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way you have forgotten...</font>

188
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That the king of snipers under all those activities, Sogeking, is me!</font>

189
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you forget about me just because I changed my appearance?!</font>

190
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

191
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! The stairs are broken, be careful!</font>

192
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong? Hey!</font>

193
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey guys! Be at ease, I'm coming back right away!</font>

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiots!</font>

195
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop already!</font>

196
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

197
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Balloon!</font>

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp came, Luffy!</font>

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp is here!</font>

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protect the ship!</font>

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Be happy, it's me!</font>

202
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, we're having nice weather today.</font>

203
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go fishing!</font>

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's out of the question.</font>

205
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, I have some good news!</font>

206
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I get back I'm willing to take the position of Vice-Captain!</font>

207
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that? Hey!</font>

208
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Luffy! Everyone!</font>

209
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand!</font>

210
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so happy that you can't stop crying, right?!</font>

211
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it, right?!</font>

212
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy.</i></font>

213
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I must not stay with you,</i></font>

214
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I brought you nothing but trouble after all.</i></font>

215
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, don't tell me you actually believed that joke back then?!</font>

216
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've known each other for a long time now.</font>

217
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way I can be serious about such a thing!</font>

218
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We argued quite a lot, but we're still friends!</font>

219
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's leave the past behind!</font>

220
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Say something!</font>

221
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop messing around everyone!</font>

222
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, Usopp is calling for us!</font>

223
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't hear him.</font>

224
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

225
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't hear anything!</font>

226
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar! You can hear him!</font>

227
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking.</font>

228
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on...</font>

229
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really mean to leave without me?</font>

230
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... good enough.</font>

231
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's how you want it,</font>

232
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have only one more thing to tell you...</font>

233
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wherever I'm headed from now on...</i></font>

234
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>is none of your business.</i></font>

235
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm leaving this crew!</i></font>

236
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

237
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry for my stubbornness!</font>

238
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was wrong!</font>

239
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

240
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I was stubborn until now...!</font>

241
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I said I was leaving the crew...!</font>

242
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to change all that, but I can't!</font>

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't, so I beg of you!</font>

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please take me back with you guys!</font>

245
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just one more time...!</font>

246
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me be your crewmate!</font>

247
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot!</font>

249
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and grab on!</font>

250
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the idiot!</font>

251
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two guys are pitiful.</font>

252
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are finally complete!</font>

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry up and get outta this bombardment to go for more adventures, men!</font>

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do your best, town heroes!</font>

255
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be crushed before they can get away!</font>

256
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! You shouldn't be cheering them on!</font>

257
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't give up! Straw Hats!</font>

258
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run! Run! Run!</font>

259
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

260
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?</font>

261
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's going on?!</font>

262
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're furling the sails?</font>

263
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have they given up?</font>

264
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Given up?</font>

265
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not that, but...</font>

266
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you up to, Luffy?</font>

267
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up! Furl the sails!</font>

268
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Are you really sure about this, Franky?</font>

269
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! You gotta trust this ship!</font>

270
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! You gotta trust, idiot!</font>

271
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! Moron!</font>

272
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, just a while ago you were...</font>

273
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... it's okay...</font>

274
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help out, you guys!</font>

275
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A name?!</font>

276
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At a time like this?!</font>

277
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, a ship without a name won't be any good at sailing.</font>

278
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's gotta be Lion-like.</font>

279
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

280
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just thought of an awesome name for it!</font>

281
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Bear!</font>

282
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Polar Bear Lion!</font>

283
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's such a weird name for a ship!</font>

284
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, The Tiger Wolf Lion!</font>

285
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that animal enumeration!</font>

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like some sort of curse!</font>

287
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Squid! Octopus! Chimpanzee!</font>

288
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without Lion on it?!</font>

289
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Lion is good for a ship.</font>

290
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though, the guys from Galley-La didn't get it.</font>

291
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This big head should do fine.</i></font>

292
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah, it's a nice sunflower!</i></font>

293
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's not it, idiots!</i></font>

294
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Well, I don't blame you for your mistake...</i></font>

295
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But, this is the ship the future Pirate King will ride.</i></font>

296
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's what you were hoping for, right Franky?</i></font>

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's right.</i></font>

298
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>One appropriate for sailing the seas like a wild beast and reaching the summit!</i></font>

299
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A wonderful sun indeed.</i></font>

300
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's not it, idiot!</i></font>

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A strong ship as bright as the sun that can cheerfully overcome 1000 seas...</i></font>

302
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Something fit for those words.</i></font>

303
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I told you no, Idiot-burg!</i></font>

304
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How does this name for the ship sound, Franky?</i></font>

305
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Pirate Ship...</i></font>

306
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thousand Sunny!</i></font>

307
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool!</font>

308
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's much better than the Dango Gorilla Lion name I just thought of!</font>

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you playing Scrabble?!</font>

310
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's even better than the Lionel Master name I thought of.</font>

311
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Better than my Being of Darkness...</font>

312
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And my Monsieur Sunflower.</font>

313
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you all lost your minds?!</font>

314
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship that can sail a thousand seas sounds nice...</font>

315
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So does the sunny part.</font>

316
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait up you guys!</font>

317
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is only the beginning.</font>

318
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The certain name for it is one I prepared!</font>

319
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen!</font>

320
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship's name will be...!</font>

321
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go with the Old Man Iceburg name, I like it!</font>

322
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The New Battle Franky Lion Gang Champion!</font>

323
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thousand Sunny, is a good name.</font>

324
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Lion Gang Champion!</font>

325
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Agreed!</font>

326
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pleasure, Sunny!</font>

327
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that the name is decided, our trip is finally underway.</font>

328
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

329
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Franky!</font>

330
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you complaining about over there?!</font>

331
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and shake off this so called secret weapon!</font>

332
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, make haste!</font>

333
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The warship has almost caught up with us!</font>

334
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know! Shut up!</font>

335
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take one last look at this beautiful Water Metropolis.</font>

336
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In moments, you won't even be able to see this island's shadow!</font>

337
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

338
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa!</font>

339
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, Coby and...!</font>

340
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad I had the chance to see you after a long time!</font>

341
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say my name!</font>

342
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about, Luffy?!</font>

343
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There're still many cannonballs left!</font>

344
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fist...</font>

345
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meteor!</font>

346
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

347
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From now own, we'll be serious about escaping!</font>

348
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's meet again someday!</font>

349
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san is so cool!</font>

350
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

351
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the son of my son and yet you dare understimate me, Luffy!</font>

352
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">V-Vice-admiral Garp, please calm down!</font>

353
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old Man Ice!</font>

354
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got the name for the ship!</font>

355
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for such a great name!</font>

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone! Thanks for everything!</font>

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going now!</font>

358
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sounds like he's saying something!</font>

359
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't hear him.</font>

360
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems those who are pirates can't set off quietly.</font>

361
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, here we go!</font>

362
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The giant air cannon strengthened with the treasure wood Adam!</font>

363
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Miracle Emergency Acceleration Device!</font>

364
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you dare underestimate me...!</font>

365
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Run! Luffy-san!</font>

366
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll get killed!</font>

367
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, hurry up!</font>

368
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll get hurt!</font>

369
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're dead!</font>

370
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de...</font>

371
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>French: Shot</i></font>

372
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burst!</font>

373
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship...!</font>

374
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got away flying!</font>

375
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They made it...</font>

376
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

377
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I remember this sensation!</font>

378
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Merry.</font>

379
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It uses three barrels of cola, but it can send us flying 1 km away.</font>

380
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's not a single thing the Going Merry you were riding could do that this ship can't!</font>

381
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's better in many ways!</font>

382
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, that ship's brave soul lives in The Thousand Sunny!</font>

383
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it gets damaged, I'll fix it up as good as new!</font>

384
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything related to the ship's maintenance and weapons, you can leave them to me!</font>

385
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Starting today, this is your ship!</font>

386
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez...</font>

387
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They got away...</font>

388
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from my grandson.</font>

389
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He decided not to come with us after all.</font>

390
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems so.</font>

391
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, the King of Snipers promised that everyone will visit Elbaf someday.</font>

392
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm looking forward to it.</font>

393
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can wait patiently; a Giant's lifespan is 300 years after all.</font>

394
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was some work!</font>

395
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

396
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, time to go back to headquarters.</font>

397
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're definitely coming too!</font>

398
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still much work to be done!</font>

399
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go back to the station.</font>

400
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chimney, Gonbe.</font>

401
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,520

402
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What would Brother do?</font>

403
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No idea.</font>

404
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just did as Brother said.</font>

405
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll starve to death.</font>

406
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,740

407
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought this would happen...</font>

408
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What do you want?!</font>

409
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you come here?!</font>

410
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're looking for a job, I can give you one.</font>

413
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

414
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

415
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">New Brother!</font>

416
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that.</font>

421
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,900
