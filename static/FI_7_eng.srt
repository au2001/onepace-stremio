00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The connecting channel is the only way
into Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

134
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everywhere else, it's protected by a thick bubble layer
that we can't break through.</font>

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I say one more thing, Zoro-kun?</font>

136
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather not tell you in this situation,</font>

137
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I cannot dishonor my debt to Jinbe.</font>

138
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

139
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the former Warlord, Sea Knight Jinbe, to Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted me to tell you this once you reached the island.</font>

141
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have two messages to pass on.</font>

142
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, huh?</font>

143
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe?!</font>

144
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe.</font>

145
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, he did say that he was friends with Jinbe.</font>

146
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, the man who was in the newspaper together with Luffy-san?</font>

147
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Despite being a pirate, he's an amazing man who everyone on the island trusts.</font>

148
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy isn't here right now, but I'll pass the message on to him.</font>

149
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say it.</font>

150
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Don't fight Hody."</font>

151
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The second one is...</font>

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."</font>

153
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is all.</font>

154
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Click.</font>

155
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sea Forest... Hody...</font>

156
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, did you hear?!</font>

157
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They really did it!</font>

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently the Straw Hat Pirates have occupied Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

159
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

160
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's their objective?!</font>

161
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  And they seemed like such nice people.</font>

162
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could they?</font>

163
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just can't believe it!</font>

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't believe it!</font>

165
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I can totally believe it!</font>

166
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't believe it, can you?</font>

167
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if I can't believe it?</font>

168
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnapping the girls from the bay,
and considering the future that was predicted...</font>

169
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has to be them!
Things are progressing in that direction!</font>

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've finally shown their true colors!</font>

171
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently two of Straw Hat's companions are in the back room of the Mermaid Café.</font>

172
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards just went to capture them.</font>

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this creature?!</font>

174
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He transformed?!</font>

175
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji is still recovering!  Don't touch him!</font>

176
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean "come to Ryuuguu Palace"?!  You're just planning to arrest us, aren't you?!</font>

177
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... you guys...</font>

178
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!  You mustn't move around yet!</font>

179
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Are you done thinking yet?</font>

180
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go outside!</font>

181
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry.</font>

182
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really... can't.</font>

183
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why not?!  You said there were places you wanted to go, right?</font>

184
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if I do something so selfish,</font>

185
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be causing trouble for everyone in the castle.</font>

186
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'd been locked up in here for ten years,
I'd have gone crazy.</font>

187
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is to thank you for the food.</font>

188
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be there with you, so where do you want to go?</font>

189
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Well...</font>

190
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sea Forest!</font>

191
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, but...</font>

192
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that's just a dream.</font>

193
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't possibly do something
as selfish as breaking out of here.</font>

194
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you starting to cry just from saying where you want to go?!</font>

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm sorry.</font>

196
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to gather up so much courage just to say it.</font>

197
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't be mad at me!</font>

198
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're scary, Luffy-sama!</font>

199
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a pain!</font>

200
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  What was that loud noise?!</font>

201
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he throwing something at us again?</font>

202
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a rude guy.</font>

203
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

204
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is that sound -jamon?</font>

205
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be Decken's doing?!</font>

206
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's coming from Koukaku Tower -jamon!
S-S-Shirahoshi is in danger!</font>

207
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Are the guards with her?!</font>

208
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they're all tied up here!</font>

209
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?!</font>

210
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, pirates!</font>

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go and ensure the princess's safety in place of the guards!</font>

212
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What're you talking about?</font>

213
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Neptune-sama!
That means letting them know about the princess!</font>

214
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What choice do we have?!</font>

215
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Koukaku Tower is on the northeast side of the palace!</font>

216
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you, go there right now!</font>

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do we have to take orders from our hostage?</font>

218
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!  Shirahoshi is my only daughter!</font>

219
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For that reason, she's constantly being targeted!</font>

220
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything happens to my daughter, I will drive you into the bottom of the deep sea!</font>

221
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So basically, she is the Mermaid Princess?  Am I right?</font>

222
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If so, I shall go to her as soon as I can!</font>

223
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then!</font>

224
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if she will show me her panties?</font>

225
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, Brook!</font>

226
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, what are we to do?!
He dashed off with indecent motives!</font>

227
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now the princess is in danger
for an entirely different reason!</font>

228
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, skeleton!</font>

229
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can keep me tied up, but please take me with you!</font>

230
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Koukaku Tower is under my jurisdiction.</font>

231
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything happens to the princess,
I will never be at peace.  Even in death!</font>

232
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

233
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must...</font>

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">really love her, right?</font>

235
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't be absurd!</i></font>

236
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How shameless!</i></font>

237
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No!</i></font>

238
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san, I will be going there first if you don't mind!</font>

239
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've always wanted to go to the Sea Forest.</font>

240
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All this time, throughout these past ten years.</font>

241
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... everyone warns me that
it's too dangerous to leave the tower.</font>

242
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm scared of going outside.</font>

243
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, will you really take me there?</font>

244
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

245
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you really protect me?</font>

246
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!  It'll be fine!</font>

247
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  If you're gonna cry, then I won't take you anywhere!</font>

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, to be honest, it's more like you'll be taking me there.</font>

249
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't swim, after all.</font>

250
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm so sorry.  I'm just too happy.</font>

251
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are a crybaby, huh?</font>

252
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And a weakling.</font>

253
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we go outside, you'll stand out so much that you'll get spotted right away.</font>

254
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right... I'm so sorry.</font>

255
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I have an idea to deal with that!</font>

256
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaid Princess!  Are you alright?</font>

257
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton!  Look at the side of the tower!</font>

258
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

259
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's insane!  Those aren't the usual knives or axes that come flying!</font>

260
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sound was human pirates crashing into the tower!</font>

261
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How bizarre!</font>

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Vander Decken is insane!</font>

263
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  V-Vander Decken?!</font>

264
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't good!  They're getting up!</font>

265
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This means... Enemy soldiers have invaded the impenetrable Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

266
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a sneak attack!  The king is in danger!</font>

267
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The princess is in danger!</font>

268
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sounds of the attacks have stopped, right?</font>

269
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, weakling!</font>

270
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes!</font>

271
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm counting on you, Megalo!</font>

272
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go, shark!</i></font>

273
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Megalo!</i></font>

274
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy-san!</i></font>

275
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sea Forest!</font>

276
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-Wait!  Luffy-san?!</font>

277
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Wait, Megalo!</font>

278
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you going?!</font>

279
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, brothers, and everyone in the castle...</font>

280
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please forgive me!</font>

281
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going out without permission!</font>

282
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be back in time for dinner!</font>

283
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go for a walk!</font>

284
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, Megalo?!</font>

285
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You left the door to Koukaku Tower wide open.</font>

286
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if something happens to the princess?!</font>

287
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate!  Hurry and see to the princess's safety!</font>

288
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're working my bones too hard.</font>

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's gone!  Princess Shirahoshi is gone!</font>

290
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  The Mermaid Princess is not here?!</font>

291
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awful!  A national crisis!</font>

292
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did this happen?  Who could have done this?!</font>

293
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's been kidnapped!</font>

294
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnapped?!</font>

295
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Princess!</i></font>

296
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, princess.</font>

297
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's been kidnapped, has she-</font>

298
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  What are you doing?!</font>

299
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The channel that connects
Ryuuguu Palace and Fishman Island...</font>

300
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the switch to open it?!</font>

301
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Switch?</font>

302
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Either way, we must hurry back to Neptune-sama, Skeleton!</font>

303
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to report this to him immediately!</font>

304
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got no choice.</font>

305
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Following their orders is our only chance of survival.</font>

306
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell us already!</font>

307
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are "they"?</font>

308
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't, they'll kill us!</font>

309
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill you?!</font>

310
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?!</font>

311
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, pirates working for Hody Jones!</font>

312
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in luck!
You get to be a part of this historic event!</font>

313
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken...
Isn't he the captain of the Flying Dutchman?</font>

314
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The captain of the cursed ghost ship?</font>

315
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry, I'm just his descendant.</font>

316
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a ghost.</font>

317
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I, too, have been cursed.</font>

318
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a fishman, yet I can't swim.</font>

319
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me show you the power of the devil
that I gained with the Mato Mato curse!</font>

320
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, you'll do.  Human, come forth.</font>

321
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hody!</i></font>

322
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really going to do this?!</font>

323
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop this madness!</font>

324
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's him!  Hachi-san!</font>

325
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Hachi-san!</font>

326
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Hacchan-san!</font>

327
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi-san.</font>

328
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Energy Steroid is just a drug that destroys your body!</font>

329
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are fishmen trying to destroy Fishman Island?!</font>

330
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't underestimate
the champion of the sea, Neptune!</font>

331
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi-san, give it a rest.</font>

332
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no interest in your opinion.</font>

333
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hardly believe that
you were once a member of the crew I looked up to.</font>

334
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've become weak.</font>

335
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your time has passed.</font>

336
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need Fishman Island if I want to teach
the humans a lesson, and Neptune is in my way.</font>

337
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys were the ones who taught us
that we are the superior species.</font>

338
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Arlong-san lost!</font>

339
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decken!  Hyouzou!  Why are you siding with him?!</font>

340
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You refused Arlong-san's invitation back then,
so why are you helping these young fools now?!</font>

341
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Helping?  I'm just working here because he pays me.</font>

342
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong didn't want to part with his cash
so he couldn't employ me.</font>

343
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too bad Arlong could only obtain a swordsman of your caliber.</font>

344
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're Hachi from Arlong's crew, huh?
Now that sure takes me back!</font>

345
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your captain once tried to recruit me as his underling.</font>

346
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I couldn't agree to that.</font>

347
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I could never let someone boss me around.</font>

348
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody here understands that.</font>

349
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san's ambition and his
ability to act on it were admirable.</font>

350
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, he was all brawn and no brains.</font>

351
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:58,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we wanted to, we were too young to become pirates while you were out raising a ruckus at sea.</font>

352
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now everyone who grew up in those days
has assembled here.</font>

353
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So our resolve is strong, and we've learned from our predecessors' mistakes.</font>

354
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the man who will carry on Arlong's will.</font>

355
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you, a former member of the crew I admired, are saying that you have a problem with my plan?</font>

356
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's really discouraging, Hachi-san!</font>

357
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And while we're on the subject, Straw Hat Luffy is here.  The very man who shattered your ambitions.</font>

358
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you even care about that?!</font>

359
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He called me his friend,
even though I used to be a member of Arlong's crew!</font>

360
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The three of you are my friends! {Copy-paste from 394.}</i></font>

361
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I owe Straw Hat Luffy my life!</font>

362
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would go to meet him right now...</font>

363
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>but while Arlong's will lives on,
I couldn't possibly face him!</i></font>

364
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans are your friends?!  You piece of trash!</font>

365
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm utterly disappointed in you!</font>

366
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm locked on to you, Hachi.</font>

367
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten how pirates do things?</font>

368
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have a problem with someone,
you'll have to resolve it with violence...</font>

369
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume!</font>

370
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd he throw it?</font>

371
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I touched you just now, you became my target.</font>

372
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever I throw and wherever I throw it...</font>

373
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it will change its course like a hunting bird,</font>

374
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and head straight for its target: You!</font>

375
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looked like he threw that knife in some random direction, and...</font>

376
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hit the octopus fishman!</font>

377
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mato Mato curse...</font>

378
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, there <i>are</i> several ways to stop it.</font>

379
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't we give it a try?</font>

380
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!  Don't throw all those arrows.</font>

381
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard rumors about your ability.</font>

382
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Hody, he'll kill me at this rate!</font>

383
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop Decken!</font>

384
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't he just tell you, Hachi-san?</font>

385
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken is not my underling.</font>

386
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're two pirates who have made an alliance on equal terms.</font>

387
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, you're just a nuisance.</font>

388
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn coward!</font>

389
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

390
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here we go!</font>

391
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good!  Run away, run away!</font>

392
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But wherever you go...</font>

393
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wherever you go...</font>

394
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wherever you go... they'll chase you down!</font>

395
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only I could make it outside.</font>

396
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, now I can escape!</font>

397
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those arrows won't be able to follow me in the water.</font>

398
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!  So it doesn't matter
if they're in the water or not?!</font>

399
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

400
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The number of targets I can keep in my memory is the same as my number of hands.</font>

401
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two of them.</font>

402
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My right hand, that I haven't washed for ten years,</font>

403
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">stores the memory of when I touched
the princess of Ryuuguu Palace.  Shirahoshi herself!</font>

404
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get it?!  All the love and weapons I throw...</font>

405
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will pursue my target even into the depths of Hell!</font>

406
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is my power!</font>

407
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

408
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how you've been able to keep up
your insidious stalker crush...</font>

409
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">without being seen or caught by the Neptune Army!</font>

410
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!</font>

411
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a cunning man!</font>

412
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6"><i>{\an8}<font size="40">Cunning!  Cunning!</font></i></font>

413
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, human pirates.</font>

414
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You understand Decken's ability now, right?</font>

415
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So now it's time to begin phase one of our plan.</font>

416
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say it's impossible to
break into Ryuuguu Palace...</font>

417
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but one man has been able to
throw things in there for the last ten years.</font>

418
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Namely, Vander Decken.</font>

419
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, this plan consist of <i>you</i> being the objects thrown by Decken...</font>

420
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and flying straight toward the Mermaid Princess in Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

421
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, you'll actually crash into the tower's hard walls.</font>

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, once you're inside Ryuuguu Palace, you'll open the gates from the inside,</font>

423
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and let us in.  That is your mission.</font>

424
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  If you do that...</font>

425
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll crash into the walls and die!</font>

426
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed you will.</font>

427
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which is why we're using the lives of you worthless humans!</font>

428
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Down here, you're worth less than slaves!</font>

429
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who survive the crash will carry out the mission!</font>

430
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it goes well, I will set you free.</font>

431
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you refuse the mission, then...</font>

432
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will throw you outside the bubble right now,
you inferior species!</font>

433
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way!  If you do that, we'll drown!</font>

434
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, you just have to take your chances on the method that leaves some slight chance of survival!</font>

435
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

436
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today,</font>

437
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is the beginning of a new chapter in history for us fishmen!</font>

438
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It starts when we conquer the Ryuuguu Kingdom!</font>

439
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

440
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming now, Shirahoshi!</font>

441
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now we return to the present.</font>

442
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

443
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not wait!</font>

444
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry, skeleton!  To the king!</font>

445
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!  We have to open the way...</font>

446
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or Hody will kill us!</font>

447
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji!</font>

448
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ended up...</font>

449
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">beating up all the soldiers.</font>

450
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We hadn't done anything wrong!</font>

451
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, they wanted to put me in handcuffs!</font>

452
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  Everyone is looking at us so coldly!</font>

453
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their eyes are like the fish of the deep sea!</font>

454
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, quit whining.  It's too late now.</font>

455
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You should have thought about that
before beating them up!</i></font>

456
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You took out half of them too!  With your Kung Fu!</font>

457
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were pretty strong.</font>

458
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">E-Even if you say that, I'm not happy at all, you jerk!</font>

459
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The voice of a lady!</font>

460
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone covered in blood has washed ashore!</font>

461
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you from the Fishman District?!</font>

462
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

463
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone, get a doctor!</font>

464
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a doctor!</font>

465
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi?!</font>

466
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?!</font>

467
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Hachi, it's us!</font>

468
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you get all those injuries?!</font>

469
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

470
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's you guys.</font>

471
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad I found you.  Is Straw Hat here?</font>

472
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not.  Wait, I'll help you.</font>

473
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gather your crew.  Hurry!</font>

474
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're better off...</font>

475
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">not getting involved in this island's affairs any more.</font>

476
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave Fishman Island.</font>

477
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New Fishman Pirates are going to
attack this island!</font>

478
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ryuuguu Kingdom will be destroyed!</font>

479
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama!</font>

480
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's been kidnapped!
The princess was carried off by someone or another!</font>

481
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, a group of pirates came raining down by the tower.</font>

482
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, we are under attack!  Under attack!</font>

483
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnapped?!  Who could have taken Shirahoshi?!</font>

484
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An enemy attack, now?</font>

485
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we going to do?</font>

486
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why now?!
We're already attacking the palace ourselves!</i></font>

487
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>W-What should we do?!</i></font>

488
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>On second thought, don't answer that!</i></font>

489
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll cut them down.</font>

490
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I said don't answer!</i></font>

491
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're going to survive...</font>

492
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to open the gate to the palace!</font>

493
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Here they come!</font>

494
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you gonna come out of the shark now?</font>

495
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, I'd rather stay inside.</font>

496
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How does it feel,
being outside for the first time in ten years?</font>

497
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart won't stop racing.</font>

498
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have done something really awful.</font>

499
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just going outside isn't bad!</font>

500
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so weird.</font>

501
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this...</font>

502
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what they call an "adventure"?</font>

503
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

504
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're this excited, then it's an adventure alright!</font>

505
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said something about the Sea Forest, right?</font>

506
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?  Is it a fun place?</font>

507
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A grave...</font>

508
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a grave there that I haven't visited once since it was built.</font>

509
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not once in all these ten years.</font>

510
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the one place I've wanted to go to the most!</font>

511
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has it really been ten years...</font>

512
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since the assassination that took place in broad daylight, throwing Fishman Island into chaos?</font>

513
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How time flies.</font>
