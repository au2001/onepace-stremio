They may blame Fishman Island for this.</font>

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  It's coming back?!</font>

138
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Luffy okay up there?!</font>

139
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to Princess Shirahoshi?!</font>

140
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decken again?!  That insane pirate!</font>

141
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run away too!  It's too dangerous here!</font>

142
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll take care of Hody and his men.</font>

143
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those of you still watching,
get out of here and leave the island!</font>

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No!</i></font>

145
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying?!  It's particularly important that women and children get away!</font>

146
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, go!</font>

147
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates, a bunch of human outlaws,
are fighting to protect this island!</font>

148
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just run away right before their eyes!</font>

149
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  We're the ones who asked them for help!</font>

150
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't do anything to help,
but I want to share their fate!</font>

151
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too!</font>

152
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And me, Right Minister!</font>

153
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

154
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, this is your duty!</font>

155
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!  You <i>must</i> pass on my words
to everyone else watching the battle!</font>

156
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood?!</font>

157
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone here has to make up their own mind.</font>

158
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you still want to stay, then suit yourselves!</font>

159
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come at me, criminals!</font>

160
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy-san. </font>

161
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Air Tank.</font>

162
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one you met earlier. </font>

163
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?  What's with this broadcast?</font>

164
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been briefed on this terrible situation. </font>

165
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our sensors have detected the falling Noah.</font>

166
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, whatever shall you do about the Noah? </font>

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they doing?  Their transmission is being broadcast all over the country!</font>

168
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi... Straw Hat...</font>

169
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish we could do more,
but all we can do is entrust everything to you.</font>

170
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me how hard it is!
Just hurry up and give the air to me! </font>

171
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Luffy's voice!  I'm so relieved!</font>

172
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up with this conversation?</font>

173
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just heard the Princess's voice too!</font>

174
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat... isn't he that notorious criminal?</font>

175
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The human?</font>

176
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san, we leave Fishman Island to you! </font>

177
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is the Border Police relying on a human pirate?</font>

178
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he have some sort of plan?</font>

179
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human's gonna stop the Noah?</font>

180
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hat. </font>

181
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you hear me? </font>

182
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi...</font>

183
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody Jones... </font>

184
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand him now. </font>

185
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro-hoshi!  What do you mean, you understand him?!</font>

186
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody is...</font>

187
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a monster bred by his environment!</font>

188
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New Fishman Pirates are nothing but monsters born of pure malice!</font>

189
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their ancestors' hatred has been passed on
to them in the shadows of Fishman Island.</font>

190
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fear that it might be forgotten.</font>

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fear the day that
their grudge toward the humans fades away.</font>

192
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They live desperately...</font>

193
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and wish that humans will be evil,
just so their crusade will be justified!</font>

194
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These bloodthirsty monsters...</font>

195
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">don't even want peace for Fishman Island!</font>

196
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What could have possibly happened to make you do this? </i></font>

197
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Answer me, Hody!</i></font>

198
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Just what did the humans do to you?!</i></font>

199
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nothing.</i></font>

200
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?  Nothing?!</i></font>

201
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We must bestow judgment upon the humans.</i></font>

202
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We were chosen by the heavens...</i></font>

203
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and given the power to do so!</i></font>

204
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I see...</i></font>

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That explains it.</i></font>

206
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their grudge...</font>

207
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has no personal experience or will behind it!</font>

208
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no substance to it.</font>

209
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are a completely empty enemy!</font>

210
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their grudge...</font>

211
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has no personal experience or will behind it!</font>

212
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no substance to it.
They are a completely empty enemy!</font>

213
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Empty?  What's Prince Fukaboshi trying to say?</font>

214
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!
Don't just stand there!  Get off the island!</font>

215
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can already see the Noah above the island!</font>

216
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry, Weak-hoshi!</font>

217
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody-sama has become even more terrifying.</font>

218
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The creatures known as humans are inferior to us.</i></font>

219
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't forget that, Hody.</i></font>

220
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They are... vile beings.</i></font>

221
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hopeless!  We're done for!</font>

222
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that the Age of Pirates has begun...
our brethren are dying every day!</font>

223
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The humans are kidnapping young mermaids and selling them to the Human Shop!</font>

224
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only thing left for us is death!  Fishman Island is done for!</font>

225
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn those humans!</font>

226
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

227
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is incredible!  It's the birth of a hero!</font>

228
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Praise the hero who blew up the Human Shop
at the cost of his own life!</font>

229
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serves you right, humans!</font>

230
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great!</font>

231
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

232
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heroes are so cool -hi!</font>

233
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dosun!</font>

234
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san sunk another human pirate ship!</font>

235
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a holy war!</font>

236
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since ancient days, that trash called humanity...</font>

237
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has been jealous of fishmen, who were chosen by the heavens and granted superior power.</font>

238
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fear us!</font>

239
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And...</font>

240
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they've responded by persecuting us!</font>

241
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The humans infest this world like maggots...</font>

242
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and they used their only strength, the fact that they outnumber us,</font>

243
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to drive fishmankind to the bottom of the sea!</font>

244
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, everyone!</font>

245
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse the humans!</font>

246
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This human named Rayleigh,
who I've known since childhood...</font>

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a different kind of human.</font>

248
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't seem scared at all when he looks at me!</font>

249
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyuu- Hody?</font>

250
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like your stories, Hachi-san.</font>

251
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You make me want to vomit!</font>

252
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The humans fear us!</font>

253
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry on our ancestors' grudge!</font>

254
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got that, Hody?</font>

255
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never forget, Hody!</font>

256
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are vile.  They are an inferior race!</font>

257
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse the humans!</font>

258
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse them!  Curse them!  Curse them!</font>

259
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible!
Tiger-san, the hero who freed the slaves...</font>

260
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was killed by the humans!</font>

261
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

262
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This means that Tiger wasn't the chosen hero either.</font>

263
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?  Please, leave us alone!</font>

264
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We heard that you donated blood to a human.</font>

265
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what?!</font>

266
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A human was about to die right in front of-</font>

267
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Daddy!</font>

268
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,450

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They want to forgive the humans!</font>

270
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!</font>

271
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you hear?
Jinbe-san joined the Seven Warlords of the Sea -hi!</font>

272
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Arlong Pirates are the only ones maintaining the dignity of our race.</font>

273
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,860

274
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?!  This is what humans are!</font>

275
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her Majesty was so generous toward the humans,
yet they showed her no mercy!</font>

276
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Royal Family won't take revenge and uphold their pride,</font>

277
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then we can't trust this country at all!</font>

278
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need a weak country like that!</font>

279
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one responsible for the shameless campaign was punished by the heavens!</font>

280
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only natural that villains
who want to forgive the humans end up dead -dosun!</font>

281
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The time for our revenge has come.</font>

282
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heavens have finally chosen us,
and given us power!</font>

283
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this...</font>

284
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those legendary goods -hi?!</font>

285
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe you got them -dosun!</font>

286
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you mass produce them, Zeo?</font>

287
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give it a try.</font>

294
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans, you despicable inferior species.</font>

295

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were too late!</font>

297
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know when it happened, but those in

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where are you going?!</font>

303
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let me go!  The Noah-</font>

305
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We kept collecting signatures in Mother's place,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother was killed by Fishman Island's malice!</font>

322
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet, the voice of malice spoke
from somewhere in my heart, and I listened...</font>

323
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,050

325

only the living create and nurture!</font>

327
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't fully abandon my grudge against
the humans, so I overlooked what was happening...</font>

328
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and allowed the malice

because of a grudge against humankind!</font>

332
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Careful now.</font>

333
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This bubble can't protect the island, it has to envelope the ship!</font>

334
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must hit the Noah!  If it misses, it'll be useless!</font>

335
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, I beg of you!</font>

336
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need our past!</font>

339
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright... Now!</font>

340
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go!</i></font>

341
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,050

343
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enough of your nonsense, Fukaboshi!</font>

344
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishmankind's grudge will never fade!</font>

345
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro-hoshi.</font>

346
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I get my way, you won't have to worry.</font>

347
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey... Aren't they the ones
fighting Hody's crew in Gyoncord Plaza?  </font>

348
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, apparently it's the Straw Hat Pirates.</font>

349
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe's with them too!</font>

350
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

351
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Luffy-chan's voice!</font>

352
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true!</font>

353
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  It's inside the air bubble!</font>

354
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We made the decision with Jinbe when we entered the plaza.</font>

355
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!</font>

356
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can leave it all to us, Bro-hoshi!</font>

357
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're friends, ain't we?</font>

358
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could we have doubted humans like these?</font>

359
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong?!  Don't stop!</font>

360
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to get out of here!  Come on!</font>

361
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... staying on the island.</font>

362
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

363
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too!</font>

364
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And me!</font>

365
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't run either!</font>

366
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither will I!</font>

367
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, there's air on the Noah!</font>

368
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!</font>

369
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't escape from me!</font>

373
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480

377
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

378
