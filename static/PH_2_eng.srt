00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

3
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This thing just talked!</font>

4
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-D-Don't be ridiculous!  You must have imagined it!</font>

5
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

6
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hard enough to believe
that this is actually a dragon!</font>

7
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really a dragon?</font>

8
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, as hard as it is to believe.</font>

9
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A lizard's body with giant wings...</font>

10

it's exactly what the legends describe!</font>

11
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me...</font>

14
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could a creature like this possibly exist?!</font>

15
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I dreaming?!</font>

16
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How interesting!</font>

17
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't effective?!</font>

23
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can hear you!</font>

24
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can sense your presence!</font>

25
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's true.  The dragon definitely just said something!</font>

28
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,970

30
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah?</font>

31
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He spoke.</font>

32
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Told you so!</font>

33
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard it too!  Why?!</font>

34
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's flying!</font>

35
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pffft!  Are you companions of that Warlord?!</font>

36
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

37
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so hot... and that dragon just spoke again!</font>

38
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said "Warlord", right?</font>

39
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he have some grudge against the Seven Warlords?</font>

40
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy.</font>

41
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave him to me.</font>

42
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I will cut him in half!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even his body is hot!</font>

49
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poooh- I must say, this is pleasantly cool!</font>

53
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease this!</font>

54
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I command you to cease this, I do -poooh!</font>

55
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it!</font>

56
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  This is incredible!</font>

57

72

110
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,730

128
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess...</font>

129

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What now?</font>

140
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?  Of course he won't just become part of you!</font>

141
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody would be that obedient!</font>

142
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His upper half must be in trouble somewhere!</font>

143
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give those legs back to their owner!</font>

144
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you have any imagination, Usopp?</font>

145
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just the way he is.  See?</font>

146
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so he's supposed to be a Legman?</font>

147
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah right!  Like hell I can just accept that!</font>

148
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's your name?</font>

149
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And about this dragon meat...</font>

150
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna eat most of it anyway,
so you carry it!</font>

151
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!  Come over here!</font>

152
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Zoro!  Did you find them?</font>

153
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The samurai and the guy who got killed?</font>

154
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look.</font>

155
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What is it?</font>

156
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A-A snow covered mountain?!</i></font>

157
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... a whole mountain of ice?!</font>

158
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other half of the island, across the lake,
has snow covered mountains!</font>

159
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yet this side is scorching hot
and covered with active volcanoes!</font>

160
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up with this island?!</font>

161
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This solves one mystery.</font>

162
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mystery?</font>

163
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right!</font>

164
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The voice on the Snail Phone said it was cold!</font>

165
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please, help me! {Copy-paste from 579}</i></font>

166
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's wrong?!</i></font>

167
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's freezing... Is that you, boss?</i></font>

168
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My companions keep getting cut down.</i></font>

169
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The samurai's gonna kill us all! {End copy-paste from 579}</i></font>

170
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:10,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the killer samurai and his victims are over there.</font>

171
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island is so interesting!
It's snowing on that mountain, right?!</font>

172
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it's so hot here... I wanna eat a snow cone!</font>

173
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, you're actually going there?!</font>

174
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be way too cold!</font>

175
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, it's too far away!
Let's head back to the ship now.</font>

176
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How troubling.  It looks rather cold.</font>

177
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there are beasts there, we can take their fur coats.</font>

178
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll manage somehow.</font>

179
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No we won't!  Why are you guys set on going?!</i></font>

180
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snow cones!</font>

181
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, wait, Luffy!</font>

182
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow... What are you-</font>

183
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw it!  I saw it!  I saw it!</font>

184
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bird!  No, a person!  Huh?!</font>

185
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a person yet a bird!</font>

186
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bird?  A person?  Which was it?!</font>

187
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What're you talking about?</font>

188
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">A bird?  A person?  Which was it?!</font>

189
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?!  Was it a bird or a person?!  Zoro?</font>

190
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nobody there.</font>

191
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, what're you so worked up about?</font>

192
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're awake?</font>

193
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look around, and you'll understand.</font>

194
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible, Franky!  We've been locked up!</font>

195
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  What is this place?!</font>

196
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?!</font>

197
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was on deck eating that giant shellfish dessert,
and then... I can't remember!</font>

198
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just a guess,
but it seems likely that someone used sleeping gas...</font>

199
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and captured us while we were unconscious!</font>

200
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

201
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship was gassed, there's no doubt about that.</font>

202
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry.  If only I'd noticed it sooner...</font>

203
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good.</font>

204
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we gonna be sold off?
Are they human traffickers?</font>

205
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if they got everyone who was on the ship,
where is Brook?</font>

206
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.  We are the only ones here.</font>

207
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're human traffickers,
so they wouldn't bother with a skeleton, right?</font>

208
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't really be called a human either, you know.</font>

209
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither can you!</font>

210
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever!</font>

211
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You there.</font>

212
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did someone just... say something?</font>

213
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it wasn't any of us.</font>

214
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You there, do you enjoy a challenge?</font>

215
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In particular, a puzzle!</font>

216
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did this thing just speak?</font>

217
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

218
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This thing?  How insolent!</font>

219
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

220
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  An insect?</font>

221
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it some new kind of Snail Phone?</font>

222
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are eight of them!  I didn't notice!</font>

223
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am no pathetic insect!</font>

224
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You do not seem like bad folk...</font>

225
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are all bits of my face.</font>

226
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me,
but could you put them back together for me?</font>

227
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Face?  Now that you mention it...</font>

228
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a mouth, and this is an eye.</font>

229
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like this?</font>

230
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's that?!</font>

231
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true!  It became a face!</font>

232
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, there are quite a few parts left over!</font>

233
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it like this?</font>

234
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well?</font>

235
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Completely wrong!</font>

236
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No no no... This should work.</font>

237
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're making progress!</font>

238
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong!  Wrong!</font>

239
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna try!</font>

240
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

241
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't play around with other people's faces!</font>

242
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's done!</font>

243
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's become a proper face!</font>

244
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel some slight discomfort in my jaw and forehead...</font>

245
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but, very well.</font>

246
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thank you!</font>

247
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A detached head is talking!</i></font>

248
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now</i> you notice?!</font>

249
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you be alive?!  Are you an evil spirit?!</font>

250
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not understand either.</font>

251
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was not reduced to a head by choice.</font>

252
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That fellow used some queer technique.</font>

253
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I would die upon being cut to pieces,
yet I found myself in this state.</font>

254
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be cut up by the enemy and yet remain alive...</font>

255
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is a disgrace to a warrior!</font>

256
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One.  Two.</font>

257
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three.</font>

258
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And four.</font>

259
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?  Did you find them?</font>

260
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I did.  I'm about to take them out.</font>

261
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Four intruders.</font>

262
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

263
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How exciting.</font>

264
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful, now.</font>

265
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger that.</font>

266
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were cut down by the enemy,</font>

267
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and you're still alive, even as just a head?</font>

268
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How?!  I don't get it!</font>

269
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's like Buggy!  How strange.</font>

270
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I could slice open my belly and let my body decay,</font>

271
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there are things I must do,
even if my greatest failure must be known!</font>

272
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, you... Do you know where we are?</font>

273
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"You"?!</font>

274
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare a female address me, a warrior, in such an informal manner?!</font>

275
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Women shall walk three steps behind men and address them with a modest grace! {Gil : Nami says 'Huh?' or something after this line. Maybe add this in?}</font>

276
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that, you bastard?</font>

277
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got some nerve, for a severed head!</font>

278
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're talking to the ones who put your head back together!</font>

279
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Cease this violence!</font>

280
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're still talking?!</font>

281
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease this, woman! {Gil : Originally 'Lass'. Makes me think of a scottish accent more than something a samurai would say. Maybe something like 'Girl' or just 'Woman' would be better. Alternatively, if we want to make him sound old-fashioned a bit more we could use 'Wench' or something... }</font>

282
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of country do women like this come from?</font>

283
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So rude and self-centered...</font>

284
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However,</font>

285
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you must be deeply grieved 
to have been robbed down to your underwear.</font>

286
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I offer my sympathy.</font>

287
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't been stripped!</font>

288
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

289
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just fashion!</font>

290
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How lewd!  That is nothing but a breast-band, is it not?! {lol this piano music...suddenly this is a saloon! -Fadeout4}</font>

291
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, you don't like it?</font>

292
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I daresay I do.</font>

293
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...</font>

294
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those lecherous eyes!</font>

295
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is a trap, it is!</font>

296
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think his skull's been cracked!  Doesn't it hurt?</font>

297
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts... It hur... It hurts not!</font>

298
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is... merely itchy!</font>

299
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so women from other countries wear only breast-bands?</font>

300
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, I quite like it.</font>

301
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incidentally, who are you people?</font>

302
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that you were dragged here from your ship.</font>

303
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're pirates.</font>

304
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates?!</font>

305
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You people are pirates?!</font>

306
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That explains your savagery!</font>

307
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I loathe pirates.  They make me vomit!</font>

308
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought that perhaps it was fate that brought us to this island of ice at the same time,</font>

309
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and that maybe we could escape together.</font>

310
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But regrettably, since you are pirates,</font>

311
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second.
What do you mean "island of ice"? {should we add an "oy, oy" to the beginning of this? -Fadeout4} {Gil : I'd rather not. It sounds okay when spoken but is kind of retarded to write.}</font>

312
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a burning island, isn't it?</font>

313
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right!  It's a scorching hot island where even the ocean is on fire!</font>

314
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, wait.</font>

315
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

316
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">say that this is an island of ice, right?</font>

317
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Haven't you heard the volcanic eruptions?</font>

318
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have heard the sound of explosions from time to time,</font>

319
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I came to this island via a sea of ice floes.{tlc suggested "but I came to this island of ice via a sea of ice floes.", but I'd have shortened it anyway as redundant. -kae}</font>

320
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease talking to me, you abominable pirates!</font>

321
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the winter sky I saw from the ship...</font>

322
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was real after all.</font>

323
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The burning island Luffy and the others went to is an arctic island from the other side. {3 line madness!! Also, not sure if this line and the next should be "Main" or "Thoughts" style}</font>

324
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Basically, we've been taken to the arctic side!</font>

325
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though if we want to know who brought us here, and why,</font>

326
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'll have to get out of this room and see for ourselves.</font>

327
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Nami-san, the door is solid.  
It doesn't look like we'll be able to...</font>

328
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out of my way!</font>

329
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a full tank of cola!</font>

330
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Hey, hey, wait a second!</font>

331
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's open.  Let's get out.</font>

332
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see that weird body isn't just for show.</font>

333
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna shoot beams too!</font>

334
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what are you gonna do?</font>

335
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd want to escape with us if we weren't pirates, right?</font>

336
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!  Be on your way, pirate!</font>

337
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way for you to escape alone without a body.</font>

338
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

339
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I right, samurai of the Wano Kingdom?!</font>

340
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a samurai?!</font>

341
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This topknot is a hairstyle unique to the Wano Kingdom. {And how the hell would Sanji know this? -Fadeout4}</font>

342
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean that the murderous samurai they mentioned on the Snail-Phone was him?!</font>

343
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary!</font>

344
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard a blast from over here!</font>

345
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

346
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be the pirates we captured?</font>

347
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun, hurry!  They're coming for us!</font>

348
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We came here after receiving an emergency signal from someone you attacked, samurai! {3 line madness PART 2!! -Fadeout4}</font>

349
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, let's hurry!</font>

350
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just leave that scary samurai behind!</font>

351
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would never bring dishonor upon myself by committing murder!</font>

352
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came to this island to rescue my son!</font>

353
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will kill all who get in my way!</font>

354
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There they are!</font>

355
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!  Don't let them get away!</font>

356
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop right there!  I'll take you on!</font>

357
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did they get out?!</font>

358
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Contact Master immediately!</font>

359
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are they?! {Gil : Nami's face looks like a plastic mask}</font>

360
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun! {Gil : And now an ugly plastic mask}</font>

361
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You brought him with you?!</font>

362
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's dangerous!</font>

363
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can blame me if anything happens!</font>

364
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a door!</font>

365
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

366
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

367
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gigantic... children?</font>

368
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Children?!</font>

369
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?!</font>

370
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are these kids?</font>

371
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps this is some sort of nursery?</font>

372
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're absolutely huge.  Are they giants?</font>

373
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did we drop anchor at an island of giants?</font>

374
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there are some smaller kids too...</font>

375
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, maybe this facility
doesn't discriminate between races?</font>

376
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't see any adults, though.</font>

377
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, who are you?</font>

378
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know them...</font>

379
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, could you be the frozen people?</font>

380
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you make it out?!</font>

381
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Frozen?</font>

382
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's she talking about?</font>

383
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're a robot!</i></font>

384
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

385
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a robot!</font>

386
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So cool!</font>

387
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I love robots!</font>

388
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the best!</font>

389
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, best?</font>

390
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun?!</font>

391
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Robot!  Robot!  Robot!</i></font>

392
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, you...</font>

393
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">like <i>armored</i> me that much?!</font>

394
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what did she mean by frozen people?</font>

395
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, look!  It's a stuffed animal!</font>

396
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

397
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A stuffed raccoon dog!</font>

398
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a reindeer!</font>

399
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How cute!</font>

400
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

401
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want one!</font>

402
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky is ridiculously popular with these kids!</font>

403
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swirly eyebrows!</font>

404
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you damn brat!</font>

405
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!</font>

406
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I say, all of you!</font>

407
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do any of you know of a child named Momonosuke?!</font>

408
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is a young man, he is!</font>

409
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary!</font>

410
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The head spoke!</font>

411
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

412
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!  Can you tell us-</font>

413
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wait!</i></font>

414
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, idiot!  We can't ask them anything!</font>

415
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just scaring them whenever you speak!</font>

416
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The door to Biscuits Room is open!</font>

417
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come!</font>

418
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's just get to the far side of the room!</font>

419
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be the pirates from before.</font>

420
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them escape!</font>

421
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of facility is this?!</font>

422
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please tell me!</font>

423
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I seek a child named Momonosuke!</font>

424
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just stop talking!</font>

425
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A woman raised her hand against me!</font>

426
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a shame for a warrior, it is!</font>

427
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to slice open my belly!</font>

428
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead!  You're getting on my nerves,
you chauvinist pig!</font>

429
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn escapees!</font>

430
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not getting out of here!</font>

431
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

432
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down.  Guns and explosives are forbidden here.</font>

433
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't use anything stronger than gas bullets.</font>

434
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we hit the children, we'll answer to the Master!</font>

435
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, children, out of the way.</font>

436
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out of the way!</font>

437
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's dangerous!</font>

438
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Robot-san.
You aren't fom this island, are you?</font>

439
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course not.  But, boy... I am a cybor-</font>

440
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have a ship?</font>

441
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we do!  Our Sunny is the world's-</font>

442
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save us!</font>

443
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does he mean?</font>

444
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, save us!</font>

445
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, save you?</font>

446
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't a nursery?!</font>

447
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not sick any more!</font>

448
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all fine!</font>

449
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sick?  With what disease?</font>

450
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those damn brats!</font>

451
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait!</font>

452
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us out of here!</font>

453
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, Lady!  Help us!</font>

454
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, wait up, children!</font>

455
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry... we're being chased, so...</font>

456
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

457
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, let's take them with us!</font>

458
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!  We don't even know where to go ourselves!</font>

459
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What good would come
from bringing all those kids along?!</font>

460
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why...</font>

461
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">am I feeling so sad?!</font>

462
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case...</font>

463
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>come save us later!</i></font>

464
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know, even though
I haven't gone outside the building!</font>

465
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island is empty, right?!</font>

466
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no town here and no people!</font>

467
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why nobody has come to help us!</font>

468
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna see Mommy and Daddy!</font>

469
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lady!  Please come back!</font>

470
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back to save us!</font>

471
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's help these children!</font>

472
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying, Nami-san?!  There's no reason to do that!</font>

473
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They even said they were sick!  This might be a hospital!</font>

474
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We only just met them, 
and we don't know what's going on here!</font>

475
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like we're a charity that rescues children!</font>

476
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think I don't know that?</font>

477
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when children are crying for me to save them...</font>

478
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">how can I turn my back on them?!</font>

479
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lady!</font>

480
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly, they're getting away!</font>

481
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those kids are in the way!</font>

482
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares?!  Kill them aswell!</font>

483
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Master will...</font>

484
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still better than letting them get away!</font>

485
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun! {OMG SANJI HAS TURNED INTO A SUPER-SAIYAN!!!}</font>

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,940

498
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm falling for her all over again!</font>

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper.  You go on ahead with Nami-san.</font>

500
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, leave it to me!</font>

501
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, kids!  Follow the beautiful lady and the Kung Fu raccoon dog!</font>

502
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll hold back the pursuers!</font>

504
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm only responding
to the longing in Nami-san's heart to save you.</font>

505
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything,
I hate you for stealing Nami-san's affection!</font>

506
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, swirly bro!</font>

507
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,060

508
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,270

509
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,360

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, a duck in a bonestorm? {Gil : This is horrible...}</font>

534
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever!</font>

535
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, pardon me!</font>

536
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were they trying to steal the cargo on the Sunny?  Who were they?</font>

537
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I really don't...</font>

538
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>By the way,</i></font>

539
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>who are you fellows?</i></font>

540
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I took them out before I got a chance to ask.</font>

541
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They all appear to be wearing some kind of gas masks.</font>

542
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gas masks?  Perhaps they used some sort of sleeping gas?</font>

543
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then those people took the Sunny to the opposite side of the island.</font>

544
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, I lost!</font>

545
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure are fast!</font>

546
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did quite well yourself!</font>

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's go again!</font>

548
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how many times you try-</font>

549
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

550
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you goofing around for?</font>

551
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I just can't find them.</font>

552
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are there really intruders here?</font>

553
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I've found are a funny guy with talking hind-legs and his group.</font>

554
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is the intruder!</font>

555
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on!  Let's keep going!</font>

556
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are Nami-san and the others?</font>

557
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:16,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since they didn't leave behind a message, 
it seems likely they were taken somewhere.</font>

558
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it!  Since you're a skeleton,
they must have assumed you were just a corpse!</font>

559
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so that's why I was left behind!  Such luck!</font>

560
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy thinks they've captured all of us.
Are there any buildings or traces of people nearby?</font>

561
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Robin-san, your reasoning is so sharp.  It's like you can see everything!</font>

562
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is...</font>

563
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a building.</font>

564
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A truly massive one!</font>

565
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't look like a restaurant.</font>

566
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook, we're hurrying over there, so wait for us.</font>

567
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-san?</font>

568
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you get here, may I see your-</font>

569
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is our enemy someone from the Government?</font>

570
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows?  Let's hope they're at least human.</font>

571
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, so far we've seen...</font>

572
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a fire-breathing dragon,</font>

573
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a half-man,</font>

574
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and a bird-lady!</font>

575
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then there's that centaur Luffy just befr-</font>

576
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now listen here!</font>

577
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  What's gotten into you?!</font>

578
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

579
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I let my guard down.  I thought you were on my side.</font>

580
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can't I be?
We're already friends, so don't attack me!</font>

581
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die, intruder!</font>

582
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another one!</font>

583
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Bellflower</i></font>

584
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A leopard and a giraffe, huh? {Gil: What is this? Enies Lobby?}</font>

585
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like there are all kinds of centaurs.  How fun!</font>

586
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're fictional horses!
Their very existence is bizarre!</font>

587
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this Baby Snail-Phone!  It's got "CC" written on it!</font>

588
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not wild centaurs.</font>

589
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be some sort of organization!</font>

590
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, even if we do return to the fiery ocean, the Sunny won't be there.</font>

591
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got no choice but to head for the arctic lands.</font>

592
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, Sanji, Franky and Chopper have all gone missing!</font>

593
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've most likely been kidnapped.</font>

594
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just hope they haven't been shot full of holes by a rifle.</font>

595
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cut that out!</i></font>

596
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd have been faster if we just dropped anchor on the other side of the island!</font>

597
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then we wouldn't have been able to eat that dragon meat or meet Legson!</font>

598
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And who is Legson?</font>

599
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's my back legs' name!</font>

600
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's go!  We're changing our objective!</font>

601
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head for the frozen lands to rescue our crewmates!</font>

602
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if anyone will be selling winter clothing along the way.</font>

603
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we go there dressed like this, we'll seriously die.</font>

604
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do we do?</font>

605
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-admiral Smoker!  We can't!</font>

606
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,340
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>The Northwestern Shore</b></font>

607
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't breathe!</font>

608
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gas is still leaking out!</font>

609
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since that damn Vegapunk's weapon experiments failed four years ago...</font>

610
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the whole island's gone rotten!</font>

611
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, I can't see Straw Hat Luffy's pirate ship anywhere!</font>

612
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way anyone would come ashore with this much poisonous gas around.</font>

613
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not it.</font>

614
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's unnatural for there to be this much gas.</font>

615
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

616
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two years ago, this was just a deserted island, with no fire or ice on it.</font>

617
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surprisingly enough, most of the toxic materials had dissipated by then.</font>

618
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why Akainu and Aokiji...</font>

619
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">chose Punk Hazard...</font>

620
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as the site of their duel.</font>

621
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A battle fierce enough to alter the climate!</font>
