<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, what's the Navy's decision about Law's punishment?</font>

260
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regarding the news about you and the wanted pirates, the Straw Hats,</font>

261
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if you have formed an alliance as reported in the news, you're guilty!</font>

262
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they have become your subordinates, Law-san, you're...</font>

263
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">not guilty!</font>

264
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our mission depends on your response.</font>

265
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We may have to arrest you and the Straw Hats.</font>

266
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, what kind of decision is that?! He can just get away by lying!</font>

267
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our original plan is ruined.
Now <i>we're</i> being targeted.</font>

268
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I take this matter to Dressrosa,</font>

269
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the situation will only worsen.</font>

270
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need to buy some time.</font>

271
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hats are not working under me! It's an alliance as the article states!</font>

272
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a clumsy man!</font>

273
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, we have to strip you of your title.</font>

274
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be if the news ended here, but...</font>

275
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding me...</font>

276
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A meteorite!?</font>

277
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It can't be!</font>

278
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop joking around!</font>

279
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

280
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A meteorite is falling on us!</font>

281
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Amazing.</font>

282
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Where's Issho-san?</font>

283
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! What just happened?!</font>

284
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only the three spots that they're standing on are untouched!</font>

285
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did the Fleet Admiral train you?! You damn stray dog!</font>

286
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter if he can see or not.</font>

287
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, thank you. I simply wanted to test your skills.</font>

288
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,100
<font face="impress bt" size="45">"Dressrosa"
Team Franky</font>

289
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Flower Field?! Are you gonna go on a picnic?!</i></font>

290
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Speaking of picnics, where did you wonder off to, Sanji?!</i></font>

291
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been...</font>

292
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in love!</font>

293
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's nice to hear. By the way, I think I can find the factory.</font>

294
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Really?!</i></font>

295
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But unfortunately, we can't just destroy it and get away.</font>

296
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna be a much bigger task than we expected.</font>

297
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait! We don't allow credit!</font>

298
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, catch that toy!</font>

299
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ran away without paying!</font>

300
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time! Doflamingo was...</font>

301
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I just read the extra edition. He sure fooled us!</font>

302
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he gets Caesar back, our entire plan ends in failure!</font>

303
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's destroy the factory and put his nose out of joint!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Anyway, come meet us at the Flower Field!</i></font>

305
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm asking you what's with that fairytale-ish place?!</font>

306
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>By the way, I can't reach Nami-san!</i></font>

307
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still think she's a weakling? She's gonna be fine!</font>

308
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook and Monster Chopper are with her!</font>

309
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

310
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh? What's wrong?</i></font>

311
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Violet-chan, what is that?</font>

312
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a broadcast from the Colosseum.</font>

313
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The unknown gladiator, Lucy, is pretty strong!</i></font>

314
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's small but tough!</font>

315
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, you won't believe this but, Luffy is...</font>

316
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's fighting in a competition now.</font>

317
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you let him?!
You should've kept an eye on him!</font>

318
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're in no place to judge me!</i></font>

319
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Foot, I have to go!</font>

320
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My men are coming after me!</font>

321
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to go to the secret factory, don't you?</font>

322
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here is a map.</font>

323
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's disguised as "Toy House."</font>

324
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's the factory.</font>

325
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I can't take this!
If you help me more, you're gonna...</font>

326
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a funny man. It doesn't make any difference.</font>

327
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like the executives already know that I betrayed them.</font>

328
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Violet-chan...</font>

329
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The western harbor! Meet me there!</font>

330
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hide yourself there and wait until I get there!</font>

331
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's our rendezvous point!</font>

332
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will help you get away from here at any price!</font>

333
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are a good-for-nothing.</font>

334
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to interrupt, you good-for-nothing!</font>

335
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool! Where did you come from?!</font>

336
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Violet-chan?!</font>

337
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to beat them all up first.</font>

338
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

339
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Amazing!</font>

340
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you do it yourself?</font>

341
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't do anything because they're holding Kanjuro as a hostage.</font>

342
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to come with me, Sanji-dono! To the place called Toy House!</font>

343
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's where they are keeping my fellow samurai, Kanjuro!</font>

344
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know where it is, though!</font>

345
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,510
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Back on "Green Bit"</font>

346
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,380
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Beneath the forest</font>

347
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,280
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Tontatta Kingdom</font>

348
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's causing the ground to shake?</font>

349
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be Law and the others.</font>

350
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I don't wanna die here!</font>

351
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

352
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hero is getting upset!</font>

353
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">J-Just kidding. The truth is the shake was...</font>

354
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">caused by my Haki.</font>

355
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Haki?! Isn't that the technique that you used to beat 50,000 villains on Fishman Island?!</font>

356
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from our hero!</font>

357
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your energy can shake up this kingdom!</font>

358
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, please eat this!</font>

359
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a Fighting Fish. It's big and a close relative of the goldfish.</font>

360
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Fighting Fish?!</font>

361
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

362
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's good! I didn't expect it to taste this good!</font>

363
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It tastes like the sea monster that I killed.</font>

364
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought,</font>

365
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they're the ones who caught the Fighting Fish.</font>

366
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of strength is that?
The Dwarf tribe is super strong, isn't it?</font>

367
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're pretty big so they can provide food for the kingdom for months.</font>

368
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland, you're a Big Human so I guess you can eat a lot.</font>

369
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffyland who belongs to my fighting force, the Usolanders,</font>

370
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can eat the whole fish with one bite!</font>

371
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's an Usoland?</font>

372
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look. Doesn't that look familiar?</font>

373
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's from the picture book that we read in Jaya.</font>

374
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that a statue of Montblanc Noland?!</font>

375
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it is!</font>

376
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know him too, don't you?</font>

377
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was a Big Human botanist who came to visit this kingdom 400 years ago.</font>

378
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At that time, villainous Big Humans were devastating the island.</font>

379
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing that our ancestors were troubled,</font>

380
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he fought alongside us and led them to victory.</font>

381
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He became the legendary hero of the Tontatta Kingdom!</font>

382
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Usoland said his name and told us that he's one of his descendants,</font>

383
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was speechless!</font>

384
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>L-Look at my head!</i></font>

385
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This chestnut-shaped head is the proof!</i></font>

386
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's true!</i></font>

387
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The chestnut-shaped head!</i></font>

388
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't have any idea! I'm so sorry!</font>
