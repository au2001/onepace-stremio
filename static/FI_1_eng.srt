63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was just a nobody!</font>

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A filthy impostor!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think God will forgive this, Coribou?!</font>

69
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will bury these imbeciles!</font>

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

71
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I've seen the real Straw Hat Luffy
with my own eyes.</font>

72
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,930
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The former rendezvous point of the Fake Straw Hats</font>

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I said, there was nothing we could do.</font>

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were up against the Dark King Rayleigh.</font>

75
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could fight off uncle Kizaru.
What could we have done against him?</font>

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only ones that escaped from the plaza were the Caribou brothers with their crew...</font>

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and a few members of the fake Straw Hat Pirates.</font>

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We captured everyone else,</font>

79
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the real Straw Hat Pirates dealt heavy damage
to the 2 Pacifista that I brought.</font>

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are the same prototypes that cornered them 2 years ago.</font>

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, the Pacifistas' strength can't have changed.</font>

82
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The change must have been in those guys!</font>

83
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">During their 2-year absence,
they've grown incredibly.</font>

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send word to Navy HQ in the New World.</font>

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates have completely recovered.</font>

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gone in the blink of an eye.</font>

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey-chan and the rest sure have become tough.</font>

88
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were watching?</font>

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.  I am a fan, after all.</font>

90
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you remembering something, Ray-san?</font>

91
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah... I guess.</font>

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  That's a nice ship!</i></font>

93
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's a stolen ship.
My house burned down, so I'm living here.</i></font>

94
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I see.  What's your name?</i></font>

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's Rayleigh.</i></font>

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm Roger!  Our meeting here is destiny, Rayleigh!</i></font>

97
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wanna come with me and turn the world on its head?</i></font>

98
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The world?</i></font>

99
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who do you think you are?</i></font>

100
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Get lost.</i></font>

101
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe there are no coincidences in this world.</font>

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's possible that everything happens for a reason.</font>

103
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fate works in mysterious ways.</font>

104
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the case, Luffy has become a man
worthy to wear that hat.</font>

105
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose it might not be too bad, living a little longer.</font>

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,600
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The waters around the Sabaody Archipelago - Beneath the surface</font>

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The surface is already so far away.</font>

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a sight!  We don't get a view this wide
in the submarine.</font>

109
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sinking faster and faster!</font>

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the water really not gonna come in?  I'm worried!</font>

111
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels like we're drifting away from the human world!  I'm tense.</font>

112
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Are we gonna be able to return to the surface?</font>

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not that I'm scared or anything!</font>

114
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ocean sure is beautiful!</font>

115
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this side!</font>

116
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trees!  No, roots!</font>

117
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... Now that I think about it, the
Sabaody Archipelago is one giant mangrove, after all.</font>

118
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The splendor of nature!</font>

119
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've already seen it.</font>

120
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah, 'cause you got on the wrong ship!</i></font>

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shut up!  Let us be in awe here!</i></font>

122
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hardly believe that the roots
stretch all the way to the ocean floor.</font>

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're so big, I'm speechless.</font>

124
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chopper...
There's something behind those trees!</font>

125
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's humongous!</i></font>

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so excited!  An adventure beneath the sea!</font>

127
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like a dream!</font>

128
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, fish!</font>

129
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I can catch them!</font>

130
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are some tasty looking fish over here too.</font>

131
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out, you two!</font>

132
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if the soap bubble breaks?!</font>

133
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kill you if you do that again!</font>

134
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, before these two do something else stupid,</font>

135
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">could you tell us how this coating works?</font>

136
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess so, Sanji-kun.</font>

137
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rayleigh-san gave me some notes, after all.</font>

138
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, let me explain it to you all.</font>

139
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She moved!  A real life beauty!</font>

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i></font>

141
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's breaking!  Breaking!  Breaking!</font>

142
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just how far can you be propelled by a nosebleed?!</font>

143
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji got thrown into the sea!</font>

144
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i></font>

145
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Come back!</i></font>

146
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ocean!  My strength is fading...</font>

147
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hang in there!</i></font>

148
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you, Sanji?!</font>

149
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like you've developed
a crippling weakness to women!</font>

150
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like you!</font>

151
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How sad.</font>

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could have happened these last 2 years,
to turn the lady-loving Sanji-san into this?</font>

153
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate, once he meets the mermaids he was longing to see,</font>

154
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he might die from blood loss.</font>

155
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll have to get
a blood transfusion for him on Fishman Island.</font>

156
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if fishmen and mermen have the same blood types as humans.</font>

157
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So basically, like we just saw,</font>

158
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the soap-bubble surrounding this ship has the same properties as the ones on the Sabaody Archipelago?</font>

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't just calmly continue your analysis of soap-bubbles!</font>

160
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fundamentally, they're the same.</font>

162
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll stretch to a certain extent,
and after that, you'll pierce through them.</font>

163
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In a worst-case scenario,</font>

164
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if we're attacked by sea monsters, we can fire a cannonball at them.</font>

165
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bubble won't break!</font>

166
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what would it take for it to break?</font>

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you'd expect, it won't hold if
a large number of holes are opened at once.</font>

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For example, if a sea monster or Sea King
bites the ship, we're done for.</font>

169
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Look out, behind us!</i></font>

170
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fight... We're saved.</font>

171
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we crash into rocks or a trench and
the ship itself takes damage,</font>

172
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then fractures in the mast or hull
could cause the bubble to break.</font>

173
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we have to avoid that too.</font>

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Basically, we have to look out for
sea creatures and other obstacles.</font>

175
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as we don't do anything stupid in here,
there's nothing to worry about.</font>

176
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!  It's stronger than I expected!</font>

177
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, of all the ships that set off for Fishman Island...</font>

178
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">70% are destroyed.  Be careful.</font>

179
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's gonna happen to us?!</i></font>

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I use my Gatling on them,
I'm sure I can catch all of those fish!</font>

181
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then how about we compete
to see who can catch the most?</font>

182
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Weren't you listening to what Nami said?!</i></font>

183
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We can't open a bunch of holes!</i></font>

184
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm gonna beat the crap out of you two!
Never do that again!</i></font>

185
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

186
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi said he'd lead us to Fishman Island,
so I didn't think it'd be this dangerous!</font>

187
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right!</font>

188
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got tons of lunch boxes.
And since Sanji's knocked out right now...</font>

189
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone!  Let's have some food!</font>

190
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay!  My stomach's rumbling!</font>

191
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My bones are rumbling as well!</font>

192
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, will the ship be safe?</font>

193
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, right now we're just riding a large ocean current, so...</font>

194
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See, there's something I need to tell all of you.</font>

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your hidden robotic functions?!</i></font>

196
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, sorry, but...</font>

197
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I am afraid that is incorrect, robo.</i></font>

198
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whoa, awesome!  Robot-language!</i></font>

199
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, Hachi had planned to
come and guide us across the ocean floor...</font>

200
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I heard he suffered major injuries on Sabaody,</font>

201
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and is now recovering on Fishman Island.</font>

202
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His reason is the same as Duval's.</font>

203
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He fought to protect the Thousand Sunny, which had been left behind on the island.</font>

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">About a year ago, the Navy found out
where the Sunny was docked.</font>

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the fierce battle that followed,
both of them were forced to retire.</font>

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Then how'd the ship last until now?</font>

207
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because there was one more warrior.</font>

208
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The very same man who
scattered us 2 years ago, in fact.</font>

209
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A member of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea, and a great man, Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

210
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A few days ago, when I arrived at the Sunny,</font>

211
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't believe my eyes.</font>

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I was waiting for you.</i></font>

213
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Damn you!  What are you doing here?!</i></font>

214
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mission complete.</i></font>

215
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny didn't have a single scratch on her.</font>

216
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And when I spoke to Rayleigh afterward...</font>

217
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I am an officer in the Revolutionary Army. </i></font>

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Because of this,
I wish to let this crew escape. </i></font>

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm guessing you figured it out too.</font>

220
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He saved our lives back then.</font>

221
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And after we vanished from the island, Kuma-san visited Rayleigh and said...</font>

222
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The time I have left... is running out. </i></font>

223
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what they were holding over him,</font>

224
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he allowed the Navy to experiment on his body,
and they slowly turned him into a cyborg.</font>

225
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shortly before the great war,</font>

226
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he agreed to undergo a modification that would remove his personality completely.</font>

227
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there's no way he could've known what we'd do after we were scattered!</font>

228
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet he waited for us by the ship?  Even though he'd lost his personality?!</font>

229
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that while he was with the surgeon, Doctor Vegapunk,</font>

230
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he got a promise that a certain mission would be programmed into him.</font>

231
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guard the ship until
a member of the Straw Hat Pirates returns.</font>

232
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, for two years he's been waiting for us.</font>

233
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Despite being a human weapon without memories, he's been obeying the orders from his past self.</font>

234
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His methods are completely messed up.</font>

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would he go that far for us?</font>

236
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's with the Revolutionary Army.</font>

237
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only explanation I can think of
is that Luffy's dad is their boss.</font>

238
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really know much about my dad.</font>

239
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I guess that bear-like guy was a good guy after all.</font>

240
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kuma.</font>

241
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, the fact remains that...</font>

242
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he was the one who allowed us to
survive these 2 years and make them worthwhile.</font>

243
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though by now, there's no way for us to ask him why he did what he did.</font>

244
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just keep this fact stored in your hearts...</font>

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This crew is indebted to Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

246
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:34,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But even if we meet him again, Kuma has become nothing more than a heartless human weapon.</font>

247
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm grateful to him, but this raises a lot of questions.</font>

248
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope we'll be able to find out Kuma's true intentions one day.</font>

249
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is all I have to say.</font>

250
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Sanji, you're awake?</font>

251
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a lunch box!  It's from the Island of Women!</font>

252
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Island of Women...</font>

253
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why should I be grateful to Kuma?</font>

254
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea where I've been for 2 years?!</font>

255
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of training did you do on that all-women island of dreams, Luffy?!</font>

256
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, now, now, Sanji-san.
Shall we sing together?</font>

257
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try to comfort me!
You're making me feel pathetic!</font>

258
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro!  There they are!</font>

259
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahead!  The Straw Hats!</font>

260
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see that, you dummy.</font>

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time I'll get to board that ship, won't I?</font>

262
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder how far we've sunk?</font>

263
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There isn't much light this far down.</font>

264
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We already passed through the sunlight level and
now we're nearing the end of the twilight level.</font>

265
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must be more than
a kilometer down by now.</font>

266
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so quiet.
This feels completely different to the submarine.</font>

267
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost like we're flying through the sky.</font>

268
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A whale!  It's a whale!</font>

269
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon?  Laboon!</font>

270
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's old man Whitebeard!</font>

271
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see something at 6 o'clock!</font>

272
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sea monster?  No...</font>

273
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you ready, you guys?</font>

274
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, Bro!</font>

275
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!  Aye!</i></font>

276
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our goal is right before our eyes!</font>

277
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We could destroy their ship,</font>

278
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and send the wreckage straight to the ocean floor.</font>

279
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's no good.
If we did that, no one would know who did it.</font>

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll take their heads
and bring them back to the surface.</font>

281
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how we'll sing out to the world,
"Caribou is here!"</font>

282
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

283
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be completely unprepared for a fight!</font>

284
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a perfect sneak attack!
Don't mess this up, you guys!</font>

285
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

286
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aye!  Aye!</font>

287
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!</font>

288
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow that looks like a ship is approaching from behind!</font>

289
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

290
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship?!</font>

291
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's headed straight for us!</font>

292
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charge!</font>

293
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pirate ship!</font>

294
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're ramming our ship!</font>

295
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away!  The bubble will break!</font>

296
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  They're trying to break into our soap bubble!</font>

297
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are they?!</font>

298
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job, sea cow!</font>

299
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

300
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they planning to board our ship?</font>

301
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sea cow?</font>

302
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Isn't that...</font>

303
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Shall we get going?</font>

304
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

305
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Mohmoo!  </font>

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Mohmoo from Arlong's crew, aren't you?</font>

307
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you recognize me?</font>

308
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!  Haven't we seen this guy before?</font>

309
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

310
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i><i>Die!</i></i></font>

311
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Rubber Pistol!</i></font>

312
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's board their ship, men!</font>

313
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

314
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Someone's coming through!</i></font>

315
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you ready, men?!</font>

316
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

317
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While these guys... stand there... dumbfounded...</font>

318
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">every last one of 'em... will be slaughtered!</font>

319
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

320
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

321
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men!  Follow me!</font>

322
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaaat?!</i></font>

323
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, sea cow?!</font>

324
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you doing this, sea cow?!</font>

325
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?!
Captain Caribou was left behind!</font>

326
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro?!</font>

327
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now... How about we give them a little greeting?</font>

328
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire the Gatling gun at 'em!</font>

329
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill every last member... of the Straw Hat Crew!</font>

330
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't!</font>

331
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please, don't throw me into the ocean!</font>

332
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's all I ask!</font>

333
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything but that!</font>

334
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't take another's life so casually!</font>

335
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">God! </font>

336
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">God is watching!</font>

337
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right?!</font>

338
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get cheeky with me!  Who was just talking about slaughter and Gatling guns?!</font>

339
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

340
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the captain of that pirate ship, aren't you?</font>

341
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?!  Roronoa Zoro!</font>

342
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're mistaken!  I'm not the captain!</font>

343
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was, uh...</font>

344
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was just being used as their slave!</font>

345
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, I'm sick of being on that ship!</font>

346
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah!  Please!</font>

347
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you let me stay on your ship for a little while?</font>

348
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!  I'm begging you!</font>

349
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know, I kinda feel sorry for him.</font>

350
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, come on!  He's obviously lying!</font>

351
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!  It was all a lie?!</i></font>

352
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, can I ask you something?</font>

353
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was with the sea cow that was pulling the ship?</font>

354
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh...</font>

355
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What have we here?  Quite a cutie.</font>

356
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the Cat Burglar, aren't you?</font>

357
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you dare look at our gorgeous navigator
with those vulgar eyes!</font>

358
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, it's gonna be fine... now...</font>

359
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's getting really annoying!</font>

360
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a sea monster that we caught in these waters.</font>

361
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Using creatures like that to pull your ship is how professionals travel underwater.</font>

362
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

363
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how it is!</font>

364
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!  Stop, sea cow!</font>

365
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened, sea cow?!</font>

366
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro!  I'm gonna save you!</font>

367
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if there are any sea monsters around?</font>

368
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second, Luffy.  What are you planning?</font>

369
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll start rehabilitating you with photos
since they don't have as much of an impact.</font>

370
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami.</font>

371
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we going in a different direction
from the one the Log Pose is pointing in? </font>

372
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, but don't worry.</font>

373
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should move southwest of the compass needle.</font>

374
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But going directly toward the island would be faster!</font>

375
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

376
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently, if you follow the needle directly,
you'll get caught up in the ocean currents,</font>

377
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and crash into an underwater mountain or volcano
before reaching your destination.</font>

378
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  A volcano?!  The ocean floor is scary!</font>

379
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I thought that all the currents of the Grand Line
are completely out of whack.</font>

380
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there really a current that <i>isn't</i> going to cause us problems?</font>

381
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, just one.</font>

382
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone!  It's gonna get cold soon.  You'd better put on a coat.</font>

383
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, my skin is starting to get goosebumps.</font>

384
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  Though I-</font>

385
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all bones, so you don't have skin, right?</font>

386
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going somewhere cold?
Aren't we headed for the ocean floor?</font>

387
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course the water at the ocean floor is cold.</font>

388
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even in a bath, the water's warmer at the top
and colder on the bottom, right?</font>

389
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right.  So if it's the same for the sea,
the water down deep is colder than surface water.</font>

390
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Temperature isn't the only thing that's different...</font>

391
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you get over it already?!</font>

392
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the deeper parts of the ocean,</font>

393
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there are giant currents known as "deep currents"
that you usually can't see.</font>

394
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are completely different from
the surface currents we've been riding so far.</font>

395
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are currents beneath the currents?</font>

396
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure are knowledgeable!</font>

397
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only because I have lived for so long!</font>

398
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The currents all have to connect somewhere.</font>

399
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They flow from the east or the west
and then meet up...</font>

400
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plunging downward and surging back up.</font>

401
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost like an enormous dragon.</font>

402
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently the deep currents flow very slowly.</font>

403
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say that once water goes down to the ocean floor,</font>

404
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it can take 2,000 years
before it returns to a level that sees the sun.</font>

405
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>2,000 years?!</i></font>

406
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  Furthermore, there are countless legends...</font>

407
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">about those dark, unknown sea currents.</font>

408
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monsters, curses, and souls of the damned!</font>

409
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!  There are ghosts in the deep seas?!</i></font>

410
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh?!  There are?!  Scary!</i></font>

411
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How exciting!</font>

412
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghosts, huh?</font>

413
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know about all that...</font>

414
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we're gonna use the downflow to dive
from the surface currents to the deep currents.</font>

415
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By doing that, we'll be able to reach the ocean floor.</font>

416
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's a mysterious sea current.</font>

417
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You didn't understand any of that, did you?!</i></font>

418
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we sing a song, Nami-san?</font>

419
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, I see it!</font>

420
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

421
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mysterious sea current?!</font>

422
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

423
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The downflow, Plume!</font>

424
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

425
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is almost like...</font>

426
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">an enormous underwater waterfall!</font>

427
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool!
The water keeps falling all the way to the bottom!</font>

428
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's unbelievably fast!</font>

429
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very impressive, nature!</font>

430
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a massive current!
I wonder how many hundred meters across it is?</font>

431
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing it for yourself is completely different from
hearing stories about it!</font>

432
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't see the bottom!  It's pitch black down there!</i></font>

433
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's all over!</i></font>

434
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If we fall at that speed,
we'll crash into the ocean floor.  We'll die!</i></font>

435
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure we'll be fine, riding this current?</font>

436
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about the ship.</font>

437
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny was crafted from the Treasure Tree, Adam.
It's the strongest ship there is.</font>

438
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Alright!</i></font>

439
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Forward!</i></font>

440
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be!</font>

441
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hadn't heard that <i>that thing</i> was living down here!</font>

442
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The demon that races through the seas.</font>

443
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy of all humanity!</font>

444
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Crew!  Turn around immediately!</font>

445
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're doomed!</font>

446
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, you're here too.</font>

447
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a monster down there!</font>

448
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's the Kraken!</i></font>

449
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The incomprehensibly gigantic monster octopus!</i></font>

450
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's crushing several ships at once.</font>

451
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has been preying on the ships that pass through here.</font>

452
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!  I don't wanna die!</font>

453
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn around!  If we just wait for a few days,
I'm sure that monster will-</font>

454
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!  Be quiet!</font>

455
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just had a great idea!</font>

456
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's tame him!</font>

457
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

458
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are you talking about, Luffy?!</i></font>

459
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll tame that octopus and make him pull our ship!</font>

460
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't be ridiculous!</i></font>

461
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look closely, or even if you don't look closely, can't you see how <i>huge</i> that thing is?!</font>

462
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, it sure is big...</font>

463
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know how many centuries it's been alive,
but the Kraken appears in countless legends.</font>

464
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a mythical beast!</font>
