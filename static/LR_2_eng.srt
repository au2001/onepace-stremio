100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,250

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you have a Jet Dial?!</font>

102
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,440

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! That's the issue!</font>

105
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we end up losing, they'll definitely take me first!</font>

106
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let that happen! I'm too cute!</font>

107
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,190

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm paddling too.</font>

110
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,320

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, Robin...</font>

112
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll end up like me if
you don't work hard...</font>

115
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we head straight for the goal,
or shall we sink them instead?</font>

116
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I enjoy the occasional leisurely trip across the goal line.</font>

117
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I wanna make that chick pay!</font>

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Winning isn't enough for me now!</font>

119
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is this?
Wonderful, Robin!</font>

121
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheater!</font>

122
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go!</font>

123
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They already caught on. Too bad.</font>

124
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capote!</font>

125
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare they?!</font>

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just keep moving!
We can't let 'em get a bigger lead!</font>

127
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I'll sink them after all.</font>

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!</font>

129
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh!</font>

130
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up ahead are the biggest obstacles
of the course: the Long Coral Reef</font>

131
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the Long Ring Whirlpool
of Long Cape beyond it!</font>

132
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How will they overcome these?! And...</font>

133
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Is that...?!</font>

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

135
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone on the island!</font>

136
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's "Full Dash" Hamburg!</font>

137
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Atop him, making an appearance at last...
is the Master of Obstruction!</font>

138
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The great scoundrel who
hates fairness; our boss!</font>

139
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Silver Fox" Foxy!</font>

140
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Him!</font>

141
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just got an evil idea!</font>

142
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The race is really heating up!</font>

143
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Long Coral Reef blocks
the course directly ahead!</font>

144
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the lead is Porche-chan's Cutie Wagon!</font>

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! It's causing strange-acting currents!</font>

146
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just plunge in recklessly...</font>

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yuck! I can't believe the
race has lasted this long...</font>

148
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monda! We're counting on you!</font>

149
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But let's not forget there's someone
on land just hoping to interfere:</font>

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">our boss, "Silver Fox" Foxy!</font>

151
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what does he have in store?!</font>

152
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some inari sushi and
kitsune udon! No charge!</font>

153
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For real?! Thanks! Yum!</font>

154
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd love to have a cook like you join us!</font>

155
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your twirly eyebrow's so cute!</font>

156
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Maybe I should be Davy Backed right now!</font>

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Some more drinks over here!</font>

158
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have all you want!</font>

159
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks guys!</font>

160
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get 'em, Boss! 
Yahoo! Just a matter o' time now!</font>

161
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh what's this?!</font>

162
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon Nami! Paddle!
Not yet!</font>

163
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're getting ahead!</font>

164
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said not yet!</font>

165
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Cutie Wagon uses this
chance to continue forward and plunge into the Long Coral Reef!</font>

166
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Monda!</font>

167
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Oh my! What's happening?!</font>

168
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monda!</font>

169
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh... They came back.</font>

170
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my! The Cutie Wagon
has been sent backwards!</font>

171
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What in the world happened?!</font>

172
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Why?!</font>

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? I knew something
was up with these currents.</font>

174
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! Let's increase speed!</font>

175
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Right!</font>

176
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try again Monda!</font>

177
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way!</font>

178
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! What the...?!</font>

179
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh! There it is at last!</font>

180
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Devilish interference from you-know-who!</font>

181
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A smoke screen...!</font>

182
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my!</font>

183
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Operation White Out is a great success!</font>

184
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see you find your way
through this coral maze blind!</font>

185
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Success?</font>

186
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How in the...?!</font>

187
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They got through! With no
trouble at all! How did they do it?!</font>

188
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as I thought!</font>

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile the Cutie Wagon...</font>

190
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!
...has been sent back again!</font>

191
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!
The boat's moving on its own!</font>

192
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a maze of sea currents.
Of sea currents?</font>

193
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep. The whirlpool up ahead is</font>

194
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">causing strange currents in this reef,</font>

195
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">full of smaller whirlpools.</font>

196
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we don't need to see ahead!</font>

197
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The currents will carry us through...
as long as we take the right entrance!</font>

198
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome! That's the power of our navigator!</font>

199
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurray!</font>

200
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curses!</font>

201
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But their joy is short-lived!
Beyond the coral forest is the Long Ring!</font>

202
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp! Quit freaking out and fire it!</font>

203
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire what?!
An Impact!</font>

204
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I told you we don't have it! Nope!
Oh? Then what's this?</font>

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did you...?!</font>

206
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! Before the whirlpool sucks us in!</font>

207
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay! I don't mind!
'Cause it's my shoulder!</font>

208
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder you seemed so calm!</font>

209
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You had this in mind from the start...</font>

210
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine!</font>

211
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! The Barrel Tiger...</font>

212
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, more than that! They're flying!</font>

213
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Barrel Tiger takes a miraculously big lead!</font>

214
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does this spell defeat for
the indomitable Cutie Wagon?!</font>

215
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We underestimated them a bit!</font>

216
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you!</font>

217
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Combine!</font>

218
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two Fish Engine!</font>

219
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! They haven't lost yet!</font>

220
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their fishman muscle and shark fin
combo doubles their engine speed!</font>

221
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They zip through the coral and
turbulent waves to close the gap!</font>

222
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The race is half over!</font>

223
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile the Barrel Tiger
paddles desperately!</font>

224
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get up Usopp!</font>

225
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?
Just start paddling!</font>

226
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your arm is twisted in an odd direction.</font>

227
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

228
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a course marker.
It says to go right.</font>

229
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! Right we go!</font>

230
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like we'd fall for that!</font>

231
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my! Our boss's Ploy #18,
"Operation Lie to Them" has failed!</font>

232
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly formidable! Does this girl
not believe anything?!</font>

233
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up you!</font>

234
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's foul-mouthed too!</font>

235
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The race continues!
Barrel Tiger is still in the lead!</font>

236
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are these columns of water?!</font>

237
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They also clear the long waves
that reach high into the sky!</font>

238
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Natural phenomenon?!</font>

239
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny...</font>

240
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bos-, no, Granny...</font>

241
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... I think I'm done for...</font>

242
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss unleashes a third nasty trick!</font>

243
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! You on the boat! Please save me!</font>

244
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable! She completely
ignores a helpless, sick grandmother!</font>

245
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is she heartless, or does she
only care about herself?!</font>

246
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the case,
Navigator Nami has a heart of ice!</font>

247
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you shut up already?!
I'd never fall for that crap!</font>

248
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's foul-mouthed too!</font>

249
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! It's the goal!</font>

250
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The finish is close at hand!</font>

251
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not so fast!</font>

252
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Cutie Wagon has caught up!</font>

253
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who will be the winner of
Round #1's Donut Race?!</font>

254
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who will be the winner?!</font>

255
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you...</font>

256
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out! You're annoying!</font>

257
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She even sees through "Operation Fake Goal"!</font>

258
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Formidable! Truly formidable!</font>

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a question for her now!
What does it mean to "believe"?</font>

260
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care!</font>

261
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh it's too late! Her heart's
already closed! She's a heathen!</font>

262
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The real goal is near though.</font>

263
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No more Impacts!
Yeah I know!</font>

264
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile Porche-chan's team has
tragically stopped at the fake goal!</font>

265
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to the race?
Hey! Where is everyone?!</font>

266
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The purity of your heart is dazzling!</font>

267
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you've been duped!
Pay attention Porche-chan!</font>

268
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So many idiots!</font>

269
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be too embarrassed to live
if we lose to these guys!</font>

270
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll take our crew too! That's even worse!</font>

271
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! This goal is a fake!</font>

272
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Who would be so evil?!</font>

273
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eep!</font>

274
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Barrel Tiger is finally
approaching Long Bamboo Cape!</font>

275
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The goal is just beyond it!
This is the homestretch!</font>

276
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right! There's the goal!</font>

277
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

278
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're catching up to us!</font>

279
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're no match for their speed!</font>

280
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it Usopp! Can you
knock that bamboo down?!</font>

281
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bamboo?!</font>

282
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

283
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like that?!
Do more!</font>

284
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Full speed Capote! Monda!</font>

285
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to sink them!</font>

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! Bingo!</font>

287
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Capote!</font>

288
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll pay for this!</font>

289
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cutie Baton!</font>

290
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that? Flower magic?</font>

291
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flower Shurikens!</font>

292
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah they're throwing stars... Yikes!</font>

293
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! We've sprung a leak!</font>

294
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay! We can make it!
The goal is right there!</font>

295
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's make a run for it!</font>

296
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Round #1 of the Davy Back Fight;
the Donut Race...</font>

297
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is about to reach a conclusion!</font>

298
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay strong Monda! We
can't let them beat us!</font>

299
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll lose if we don't do something!
Stay in line with them!</font>

300
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right Boss!</font>

301
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san! Robin-chan!</font>

302
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You speedy ladies are lovely!</font>

303
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man you guys almost won...</font>

304
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? We are winning!</font>

305
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For now! But look!</font>

306
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss is there!
So?! What can he do now?!</font>

307
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss is just like you.</font>

308
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has Devil Fruit powers.</font>

309
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow Beam!</font>

310
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the winner is the Cutie Wagon!</font>

311
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:34,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our idol Porche-chan has won the first round of the Davy Back Fight!</font>

312
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Way to go!</font>

313
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Thanks everyone!</font>

314
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the greatest Porche-chan!
It's only natural I won!</font>

315
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now let's swipe us a crew member!</font>

316
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one's a match for the Foxy Pirates!</font>

317
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha...?</font>

318
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Time for you to
hand over a crew member!</font>

319
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys hurt?! Are you okay?!</font>

320
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes we're all right.</font>

321
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

322
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beats us...</font>

323
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what we'd like to know!
Did we end up losing?</font>

324
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were about to win, but then you suddenly got slow and they passed you</font>

325
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need to be mystified!</font>

326
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was caused by Slowmo Photons!</font>

327
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What did you do to Nami's team?!</font>

328
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slowmo Photons...?</font>

329
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're a type of particle
unlike anything currently known.</font>

330
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever this light touches--</font>

331
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">whether it's alive, liquid, or even gas--</font>

332
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it physically loses a fixed amount of speed</font>

333
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">while retaining all other energy.</font>

334
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it! Are you stupid or something?!</font>

335
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He snapped at me...
Oh no! Boss!</font>

336
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that sounds too ridiculous...</font>

337
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to be real?</font>

338
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You surely know that such childish claims have no merit in these waters!</font>

339
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything they touch slows down!</font>

340
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the power of Slowmo Photons!</font>

341
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh now that makes sense!</font>

342
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After eating the Slow Slow Fruit
I became a "slow person"</font>

343
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">capable of producing these
particles from my body!</font>

344
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Observe its power!</font>

345
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yikes! He slowed a flying cannonball!</font>

346
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow Beam!</font>

347
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The effect lasts approximately thirty seconds.</font>

348
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll regain its original speed afterward,
as if nothing had happened.</font>

349
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't believe your eyes? This is--!</font>

350
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

351
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap! So that's what happened to us?!</font>

352
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is the reason they're
strangely confident about the game.</font>

353
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a joke of a power...</font>

354
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you get it now?! You lost!</font>

355
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Victory in Round #1's Donut Race...</font>

356
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">goes to us!</font>

357
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my! You were so close too!</font>

358
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That concludes Round #1!</font>

359
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now for the long-awaited spoils of war!</font>

360
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to call one member
of the opposing crew!</font>

361
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The first person I want is...</font>

362
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you!</font>

363
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship doctor! Tony Tony Chopper!</font>

364
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me?!</font>

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring him here at once!</font>

366
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Chopper!</font>

367
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a rare creature!
You're way softer than I imagined!</font>

368
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh Boss! Let me touch him too!</font>

369
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nauseatingly cute!</font>

370
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's ours now!</font>

371
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

372
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that creep was after Chopper?</font>

373
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well I guess he is the
rarest of rare animals...</font>

374
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's into cute things?</font>

375
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or furs perhaps?</font>

376
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to chat!</font>

377
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is serious!
They just took our friend!</font>

378
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys...</font>

379
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right Dr. Chopper.
You're a member of my crew now.</font>

380
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to pledge loyalty to me!
Now, put on this mask...</font>

381
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys...!</font>

382
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry we lost Chopper...!</font>

383
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

384
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a true rarity!</font>

385
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A talking reindeer! Amazing!</font>

386
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's be buddies!</font>

387
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yo! Comrade!</font>

388
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys!</font>

389
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I only set sail so I could be with you guys!</font>

390
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I-I don't want this!</font>

391
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! I only set sail
because you invited me to!</font>

392
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna go with these guys...!</font>

393
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I'm the Straw Hat Pirates'
ship doctor, Tony Tony Chopper!</font>

394
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want this!</font>

395
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit your griping, Chopper!</font>

396
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're being a poor sport!</font>

397
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro...</font>

398
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who decided to set sail!</font>

399
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one else is to blame if
you end up dying somewhere!</font>

400
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only you are!</font>

401
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We agreed to this game.</font>

402
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp and everyone else did their best!</font>

403
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one in the pirate world would
sympathize with your tears!</font>

404
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A real man...</font>

405
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...would roll up his sleeves and
watch the rest of the contest quietly!</font>

406
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you say that?!
Don't you know how he feels?!</font>

407
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Do anything you like with me!</font>

408
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper...</font>

409
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

410
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa!
That swordsman is awesome!</font>

411
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Teach 'em a lesson, Zoro!</font>

412
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get Chopper back!</font>

413
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's take him next, Boss!
This reindeer's got guts!</font>

414
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get the second round started.</font>

415
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So moving! I'm moved to tears!</font>

416
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. There's still two rounds left.</font>

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna take back our precious
emergency food... and then some.</font>

418
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji! We're counting on you!</font>

419
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The exchange is finished as the Davy Back Fight suddenly explodes with excitement!</font>

420
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Wait, Chopper's in the second round.</font>

421
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they took him.
You're right.</font>

422
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the real thrill of this game!</font>

423
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We told you!</font>

424
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't change your roster!
No replacements allowed!</font>

425
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, only the other
two Straw Hat contestants...</font>

426
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can participate in Round #2's Groggy Ring!</font>

427
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Team Foxy already has the advantage!</font>

428
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

429
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can drop out too, if you want.</font>

430
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, but you can, loser.</font>

431
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I find it hard to believe
they'll work as a team...</font>

432
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say what?!
Stop that!</font>

433
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll now explain the rules of Groggy Ring!</font>

434
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a field and two goals!</font>

435
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knock the balls into them and you win!</font>

436
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, the balls are no ordinary balls!</font>

437
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're people!</font>

438
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both teams, select someone to be a ball!</font>

439
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which of you's gonna be the ball?!</font>

440
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here's your ball mark!</font>

441
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who made you boss?!
You be the ball, Moss Head!</font>

442
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, there it is! Their entrance song!</font>

443
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the undefeated elites of Groggy Ring!</font>

444
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Defeat is impossible for them!</font>

445
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush 'em!</font>

446
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The famous Groggy Monsters
have just taken the field!</font>

447
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the lead is "Full Dash" Hamburg!</font>

448
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's followed by "Tackle Machine" Pickles!</font>

449
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Last but not least is Big Pan the wotan;
a half-fishman half-giant!</font>

450
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is literally a monstrous march!</font>

451
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, then!</font>

452
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

453
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that giant fishman?!</font>

454
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're putting the ball mark on him!</font>

455
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see you win this!</font>

456
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seem like a good match?</font>

457
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep.</font>
