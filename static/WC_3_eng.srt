longarms, longlegs, gnomes...</font>

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A country where all races in the world

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that's Mama's ideal world, Totto Land!</font>

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is called Chocolat Town!</font>

109
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chocolat Town?! What a wonderful name!</font>

110
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything in this town is made of chocolate.</font>

111
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! I love chocolate!
Am I allowed to eat it?!</font>

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this town,
you can eat chocolate all you like!</font>

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

114
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But be careful!</font>

115
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's against the law to eat
the roof-tile chocolates.</font>

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because they won't be able
to keep off rain or snow.</font>

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Window glass is the minister
of candy's jurisdiction,</font>

118
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and construction posts are
the minister of biscuit's.</font>

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And everything else other than chocolate is
private or public property.</font>

120
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks delicious...</font>

121
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Were you listening?!</font>

122
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't understand at all.</font>

123
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say, are their panties
also made of chocolate?</font>

124
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, they are.</font>

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stay on the ship, since they know my face,

129
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get me some!</font>

135
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what do you think will
happen if they find out</font>

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I brought you guys here?!</font>

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Act cautiously!</font>

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry!
We'll know where they are soon.</font>

139
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,400

142
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it were just the chocolate
walls they could be put back later,</font>

143
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the whole cafe is gone!</font>

144
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,690

marshmallows, almonds and jelly beans!</font>

145
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,900

I need to question you!</font>

Come with me!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because you said...</font>

209

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"It was too delicious!"</font>

210
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That chocolate at the cafe is a
new blend that I came up with!</font>

211
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you like how it melted in your mouth?</font>

212
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I added milk to cocoa butter
and highly pure beet sugar</font>

213
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and kneaded it for three days
straight at 29 degrees Celsius!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I can't take him away from you.</font>

380
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said he wanted to go
back to his friends too.</font>

381
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then all I can do for him
is help him with that.</font>

382
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this route.</font>

383
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the only way you can get there</font>

384
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">without Mama finding out. 
Only we siblings know about it!</font>

385
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that where Sanji is?</font>

386
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you go along this route,
you can get to Whole Cake Island.</font>

387
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Mama won't let go of Sanji-<i>san</i>.</font>

388
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So let's meet up at the southwest coast of
 Whole Cake Island tomorrow.</font>

389
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll promise to bring Sanji-<i>san</i> there.</font>

390
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cooperate with you!</font>

391
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it okay?
Won't you get punished by Big Mom?</font>

392
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm her biological daughter.
Don't worry.</font>

393
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in enemy territory.
Worry about yourself.</font>

394
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding...</font>

395
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But is it really okay?</font>

396
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-<i>san</i> and you all care about each other.</font>

397
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pudding-<i>san</i>, you're so...</font>

398
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a bit of a shame,
but my next husband to-be...</font>

399
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">could be someone even nicer!</font>

400
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-How wonderful this girl is!
Is she really the emperor's daughter?!</font>

401
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Pudding!</font>

402
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're welcome!</font>

403
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madam Pudding, we're here to pick you up.</font>

404
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One moment!</font>

405
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm working now, so wait a second.</font>

406
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to stop working until the wedding,
Madam Pudding.</font>

407
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I have customers...</font>

408
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to prepare for the wedding, too.</font>

409
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's you! The groceries
that you ordered are ready.</font>

410
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're there, so just take them.</font>

411
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, there they are!</font>

412
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you carry them?</font>

413
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks. We'll be fine!</font>

414
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Choco-burger?!</font>

415
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't look at other stuff!
Let's go! Pekoms is waiting for us!</font>

416
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want the choco-burger, Nami!</font>

417
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Choco-pasta.
– Choco-fried chicken.</font>

418
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have enough food! Come on!</font>

419
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?</font>

420
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms?</font>

421
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you find him?</font>

422
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

423
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is strange.</font>

424
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doing number two, maybe?
What about the bathroom?</font>

425
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

426
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a message in the bathroom!</font>

427
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Turn back"?</font>

428
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Did Pekoms write this?
– Who else would do that?</font>

429
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did somebody invade?</font>

430
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has Pekoms been abducted?</font>

431
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe they've found out about us.</font>

432
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any event, this is serious.</font>

433
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}"Turn back"</i></font>

434
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Turn back" means if we don't turn back,
something's gonna happen.</font>

435
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

436
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, everyone, keep that in mind!</font>

437
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's keep going!</font>

438
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

439
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is getting exciting!</font>

440
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,150
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Broc Coli Island, New World</font></font></font>

441
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,150
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Broc Coli Island, New World</font></font>

442
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

443
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– All done?
– Yes, sir.</font>

444
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, let's go.</font>

445
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you kill my wife?</font>

446
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you kill my children?</font>

447
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you destroy my country?</font>

448
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Germa, aren't you?!
You guys are not human!</font>

449
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wall.</font>

450
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it took four hours.</font>

451
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to attend my brother's wedding.</font>

452
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no interest in your family.</font>

453
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nor your war for that matter.</font>

454
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's finished.</font>

455
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could a war between such
weak countries last two years?</font>

456
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– <i>The commission?</i>
– I got it.</font>

457
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Thank you!
– Thank you!</font>

458
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our country has been saved.
Did we ask demons for help?</font>

459
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, we didn't! They're angels!</font>

460
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Drop your weapons!
The war is over! It's over!</font>

461
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Germa!</font>

462
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa 66! Hurray!</font>

463
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Germa! Germa! Germa! Germa!</font>

464
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The wedding is in three days.</i></font>

465
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two days is enough
to get to Whole Cake Island.</font>

466
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about Sanji?</font>

467
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's already here.</i></font>

468
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, great. I can't wait to see him.</font>

469
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, right!</font>

470
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See you in two days.</font>
