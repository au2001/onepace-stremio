<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sham! Get going already!</font>

127
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! M-Me?!</font>

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hurry!</font>

129
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">O-Okay, okay! I'll go!</font>

130
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's in tears! What's he trying to do?!</font>

131
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why's he making <i>him</i> fight?</font>

132
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, you! Get ready!</font>

133
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna scratch you good
with these claws!</font>

134
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What am I supposed to do?!</font>

135
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, you! Stop or I'll kill you!</font>

136
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you can!</font>

137
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">What?!</font>

138
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What the hell?!</font>

139
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You! You just underestimated
me, didn't you?!</font>

140
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm impressed you could block that
after my innocent cat act!</font>

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You seem to have a little skill,</font>

142
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but I wouldn't underestimate
Sham of the Meowban Brothers!</font>

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Missing something?
Don't look at me, though...</font>

144
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There it is...</font>

145
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Cat Burglar"...</font>

146
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Give those swords back!</font>

147
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Give them back?
But you already have a sword.</font>

148
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">These are just in the way.</font>

149
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright! Now I'm much lighter!</font>

150
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're supposed to take good
care of other people's things!</font>

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bastard!</font>

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

153
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What did you cut?!</font>

154
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can bend like a cat!</font>

155
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're up, Buchi! Get 'im!</font>

156
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right, Sham!</font>

157
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Cat...</font>

158
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Astrophe!</font>

159
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn!</font>

160
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He got away!</font>

161
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Hold him down, Sham!</font>

162
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My bad!</font>

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The bastard's way
stronger than I thought!</font>

164
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What the hell?!</font>

165
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One hit from that would turn
every bone in my body to powder!</font>

166
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's not getting away this time!</font>

167
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right!</font>

168
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm not that great at
the one-sword style, but...</font>

169
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's go, Buchi!</font>

170
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay! Let's do it, Sham!</font>

171
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Pussy Willow March!
– Pussy Willow March!</font>

172
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh no! They got Zoro
on the defensive!</font>

173
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What're you doing?!</font>

174
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's not gonna get anywhere
just blocking those two guys' attacks!</font>

175
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna help him out!</font>

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Take this!</font>

177
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Lead Star!</font>

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gotcha!</font>

179
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why're you attacking
a guy on <i>our</i> side?!</font>

180
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, it's not like that!</font>

181
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It seemed like he let it
hit him on purpose...</font>

182
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh? On purpose?!</font>

183
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp, you dumbass!</font>

184
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you <i>want</i> to die?!</font>

185
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You don't suppose...</font>

186
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>we're</i> the ones who just got saved?</font>

187
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Had you hit them with that slingshot...</font>

188
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">those two probably would've
come after us instead!</font>

189
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He...</font>

190
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But this is no time for that!</font>

191
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it! If I just had another sword!</font>

192
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna get his swords!</font>

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If I give 'em back to Zoro,
he'll win for sure!</font>

194
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In that case, I'll do it!</font>

195
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't push yourself!
You can barely even stand!</font>

196
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Nami!</font>

197
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami!</font>

198
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What do you need swords for?</font>

199
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Uhh! I-I can explain!</font>

200
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Night is long gone now...</font>

201
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">so it seemed odd that the plan
wasn't making any progress.</font>

202
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">C-Captain Kuro!</font>

203
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">W-We're dead!</font>

204
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This can't get any worse!</font>

205
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What the hell is all this?!</font>

206
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To think that these brats
have held you back...</font>

207
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How the Black Cat
Pirates have fallen...</font>

208
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right...</font>

209
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Jango?!</font>

210
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">B-B-But...</font>

211
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you said letting that kid go
wouldn't cause any problems!</font>

212
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, I did say that.</font>

213
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:19,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But so what? We knew he was
going to try to stand up to us.</font>

214
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The only thing I didn't count on...</font>

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">was your guys' feebleness!</font>

216
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Us, f-feeble?</font>

217
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who're you calling feeble?!</font>

218
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Watch what you say, Captain Kuro!</font>

219
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, you were strong before!</font>

220
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But that was three years ago!</font>

221
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's not like we partied while you
lived the easy life in this village!</font>

222
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right! We've attacked lots of
towns and sunk lots of pirates!</font>

223
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your point being...</font>

224
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've done nothing for three years!</font>

225
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no way you can beat
the Meowban Brothers of today!</font>

226
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">S-Stop! Buchi! Sham!</font>

227
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're not our captain anymore!</font>

228
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sorry, but we're gonna kill ya!</font>

229
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-When did he get behind them?!
And those weapons...</font>

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Who</i> are you going to kill?!</font>

231
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He snuck...</font>

232
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">...behind us!</font>

233
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?! He's gone!</font>

234
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There it is!
The Pussy Foot Maneuver...</font>

235
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're right.</font>

236
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I do feel a bit of sluggishness.</font>

237
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's handling them like kids,</font>

238
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">after they had the upper hand
against Zoro and his one sword!</font>

239
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That man's "Pussy Foot Maneuver"
is a silent movement technique.</font>

240
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even a group of fifty assassins would
be killed before sensing him!</font>

241
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no way we
can escape his plan!</font>

242
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I got chills after seeing that
habit of his again three years after!</font>

243
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">His odd way of lifting his glasses
to avoid cutting his own face</font>

244
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">with those cat claws...</font>

245
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">clear proof that he hasn't
forgotten how to fight!</font>

246
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It seems I've grown
a bit good-natured myself...</font>

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">during my last
three years on dry land...</font>

248
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll give you five minutes.</font>

249
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you can't take care
of things here in five minutes...</font>

250
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">then I'll kill every last one of you...</font>

251
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">with my own two hands!</font>

252
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">F-Five minutes...</font>

253
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Five minutes should be enough!</font>

254
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Him! If we just beat him,
we can get past this hill!</font>

255
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We had the upper hand
against him just now!</font>

256
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll cut him up in five minutes!</font>

257
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're counting on you,
Meowban Brothers!</font>

258
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Zoro!</font>

259
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

260
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hey! You're kicking
my swords now?!</font>

261
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where's my "thanks"?</font>

262
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah...</font>

263
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks!</font>

264
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's no use! Three swords
won't help you!</font>

265
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your skill's still the same!</font>

266
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tiger...</font>

267
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You don't get it, do you?</font>

268
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">...Trap!</font>

269
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Four minutes.</font>

270
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just having three swords is different...</font>

271
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">from knowing the three-sword style!</font>

272
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's strong...</font>

273
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One hit...</font>

274
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He beat the Meowban
Brothers in one hit!</font>

275
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't worry!</font>

276
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll crush every last one of you
before your five minutes are up!</font>

277
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Two minutes.</font>

278
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I'll... Slaughter him...</font>

279
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">C-Captain...</font>

280
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hypnotize me...</font>

281
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">P-Please, Captain!</font>

282
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's alive. You do sloppy work.</font>

283
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">His tough fat saved him, huh...?</font>

284
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get 'im, Buchi!</font>

285
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">More hypnosis?!</font>

286
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This guy means trouble! He could
already crack the ground apart!</font>

287
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What happens when he's powered up?!</font>

288
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is my chance!</font>

289
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I gotta wake him up while I still can!</font>

290
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What is that crafty girl...</font>

291
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">up to now?</font>

292
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everyone's seriously hurt,
and he's just sleeping!</font>

293
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Die!</font>

294
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get up!</font>

295
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami! Look out!</font>

296
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Split in two!</font>

297
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dodge it!</font>

298
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What the?!</font>

299
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A chakram! It wasn't
just a hypnosis tool?!</font>

300
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami! How dare you
stomp on my face!</font>

301
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He's alive?!</font>

302
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can't tell if he has
good or bad timing...</font>

303
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">L-Luffy...</font>

304
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy!</font>

305
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oww...</font>

306
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oww!</font>

307
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He's alive again!</font>

308
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is bad!</font>

309
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Five minutes is impossible now!</font>

310
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami! That hurts, you jerk!</font>

311
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That wasn't me!</font>

312
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It wasn't me...</font>

313
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-Nami! Did you hurt your shoulder?</font>

314
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-It's nothing. I'm fine...</font>

315
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've done everything I can for now...</font>

316
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">so I leave the rest to you...</font>

317
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We absolutely can't
afford to lose this fight...</font>

318
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah!</font>

319
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Try hard! For my treasure!</font>

320
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay! That sounds like you, alright!</font>

321
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One minute.</font>

322
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can't be serious!</font>

323
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Not even Captain Jango and Buchi...</font>

324
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">...can finish them in one minute!</font>

325
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buchi! There's no time to think!</font>

326
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kill that bellyband bastard!</font>

327
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I'll handle that weird kid...</font>

328
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll kill Straw Hat!</font>

329
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's about time for
everyone to die now.</font>

330
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh? That bad butler is here too!</font>

331
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't approach me...</font>

332
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">from behind!</font>

333
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kaya!</font>

334
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp! Are you okay?!</font>

335
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">K-Kaya... What are you doing here?!</font>

336
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm so sorry, Usopp...</font>

337
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I know you may not accept my
apology, but I just couldn't believe it...</font>

338
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">K-Klahadore, a pirate...</font>

339
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Never mind that!</font>

340
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why are you here?!
I told you to run away!</font>

341
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your life is in danger!</font>

342
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But you're fighting!</font>

343
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even after I treated you so horribly
and you've been hurt so much...</font>

344
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you're still fighting for me! So I...</font>

345
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Miss Kaya...</font>

346
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why are you here?</font>

347
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">S-Stop this...</font>

348
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop this, Klahadore!</font>

349
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Merry told me everything.</font>

350
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Isn't that the girl from the mansion?</font>

351
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Meaning she's the plan's final target?!</font>

352
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then there's no need to
go to the village now?</font>

353
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We just need to kill her, right?!</font>

354
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore, please! If you want
my fortune, you can have it all!</font>

355
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just please leave
this village! Right now!</font>

356
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I will gladly accept it, but...</font>

357
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">there's one other thing
I want, you see...</font>

358
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What I want...</font>

359
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">is peace of mind.</font>

360
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Peace...?</font>

361
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes. I want simple peace.</font>

362
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I find the villagers' trust that I've
fostered these past three years</font>

363
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">to be nice and comfortable now.</font>

364
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So I want to have that
peace of mind forever...</font>

365
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I...</font>

366
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I <i>will</i> have that peace!
<i>And</i> your fortune...</font>

367
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In short, pirates <i>will</i>
come to the village!</font>

368
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And...</font>

369
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you will leave your will and die!</font>

370
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">These two things are absolute.</font>

371
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-No...</font>

372
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-You're not...</font>

373
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Run!</font>

374
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Run away, Kaya! There's no use
talking to him! Run away!</font>

375
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-You're not Klahadore...</font>

376
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're not Klahadore!</font>

377
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kaya...</font>

378
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Leave this village! Leave this minute!</font>

379
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I see. You've certainly grown
a lot these past three years...</font>

380
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Miss Kaya.</font>

381
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you remember? So much
has happened in three years...</font>

382
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We spent so much time together...</font>

383
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">even before your parents passed
away and you became bedridden...</font>

384
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So much time...</font>

385
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So many memories...</font>

386
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Together we suffered,
together we rejoiced...</font>

387
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">K-Klahadore...</font>

388
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I would visit the city with you...</font>

I constantly looked after you...</font>

390
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You listened to my
stories so happily...</font>

391
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I devoted myself to you...</font>

392
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">For so long...</font>

393
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, for so long...</font>

394
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I endured it...</font>

395
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:40,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, it was all so that

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">had to smile humbly
for some snot-nosed girl!</font>

398
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I went against my nature
and sucked up to you...!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn you...</font>

400
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you understand these daily insults?</font>

401
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you understand this man once
known as Captain Kuro?!</font>

402
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kuro!</font>

403

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Come to think of it...</font>

404

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

406
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:47,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You hit me with all your
might, as I recall...</font>

407
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:15,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you hate getting hit that much,
I got a hundred more punches for you!</font>
