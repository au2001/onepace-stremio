this hill no matter what...</font>

124
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but someone's in the way.</font>

125
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get rid of him.</font>

126
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Th-There's no way <i>we</i> can do that!</font>

127
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right, Buchi?!</font>

128
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, he looks strong!</font>

129
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?</font>

130
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Besides, we're just
supposed to guard the ship!</font>

131
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, that's right! I'm not sure
why you'd make us fight...</font>

132
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Huh? I thought he said
this was their trump card...</font>

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Sham! Get going already!</font>

134
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! M-Me?!</font>

135
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Now!</font>

136
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A-Alright, I'll do it!</font>

137
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's crying!</font>

138
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's his game plan?</font>

139
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why make this poor guy fight?</font>

140
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, you!</font>

141
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get ready!</font>

142
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm gonna scratch you up
real good with these claws!</font>

143
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What the hell are you up to?!</font>

144
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, you! Stop or I'll cut you in half!</font>

145
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Good luck with that!</font>

146
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What the hell?!</font>

148
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You!</font>

149
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I got you to drop
your guard, didn't I?</font>

150
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm impressed you could still block
after my poor-little-kitty-cat routine!</font>

151
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You might have a bit of skill,</font>

152
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but I wouldn't underestimate
Sham of the Meowban Brothers!</font>

153
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Missing something?
Well, don't look at me!</font>

154
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There it is...</font>

155
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Cat Burglary...</font>

156
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Give those swords back!</font>

157
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Give them back?
But you already have a sword.</font>

158
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">These are just in the way.</font>

159
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Perfect!</font>

160
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That lightened the load!</font>

161
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Show a little respect
for other people's stuff!</font>

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Bastard!</font>

163
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

164
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I wonder what you actually cut!</font>

165
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm as limber as a cat!</font>

166
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're up, Buchi!</font>

167
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get 'im!</font>

168
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">On it, Sham!</font>

169
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Cat...</font>

170
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Astrophe!</font>

171
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Damn!</font>

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He got away!</font>

173
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! Hold him down better, Sham!</font>

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">My bad!</font>

175
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This meathead is way
stronger than I thought!</font>

176
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What the hell?!</font>

177
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One hit from that guy would
pulverize every bone in my body!</font>

178
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's not getting away this time!</font>

179
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's right!</font>

180
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One-sword style isn't really
my specialty, but...</font>

181
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let's go, Buchi!</font>

182
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah! Let's do it, Sham!</font>

183
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– Pussy Willow March!
– Pussy Willow March!</font>

184
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is bad! They have Zoro
on the defensive!</font>

185
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you doing?!</font>

186
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's not gonna get anywhere
just blocking their attacks!</font>

187
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm gonna help him out!</font>

188
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Take this!</font>

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Lead Star!</font>

190
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Gotcha!</font>

191
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, why are you hitting <i>him</i>?!
He's on <i>our</i> side!</font>

192
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, that's not it!</font>

193
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's almost like he got
hit on purpose...</font>

194
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh? On purpose?!</font>

195
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp, you dumbass!</font>

196
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you <i>want</i> to die?!</font>

197
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You don't suppose...</font>

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">we're the ones who just got saved?</font>

199
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you had hit them with
your slingshot...</font>

200
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">they probably would've
come after us instead!</font>

201
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So he...</font>

202
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is no time for that!</font>

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Damn it!</font>

204
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If I just had one more sword...!</font>

205
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm gonna get his swords!</font>

206
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If I get them back to him,
he'll win for sure!</font>

207
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In that case, I'll do it!</font>

208
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't push yourself!</font>

209
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You can barely even stand!</font>

210
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wait! Nami!</font>

211
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami!</font>

212
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What do you need swords for?</font>

213
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Er... I-I can explain!</font>

214
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dawn has long since passed...</font>

215
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so it seemed odd that the plan
wasn't making any progress.</font>

216
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">C-Captain Kuro!</font>

217
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">W-We're dead!</font>

218
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Things can't get any worse!</font>

219
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What in the hell is going on here?!</font>

220
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">To think that mere children
have kept you from progressing...</font>

221
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How the Black Cat Pirates have fallen...</font>

222
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't you think...</font>

223
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Jango?!</font>

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">B-B-But...</font>

225
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">you said letting that kid go
wouldn't cause any problems!</font>

226
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, I did say that.</font>

227
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?</font>

228
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And what of it?</font>

229
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He was obviously going
to try and make a stand.</font>

230
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The one thing I failed to account for...</font>

231
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">was how pathetic all of you are!</font>

232
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We're... pathetic?</font>

233
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wh-Who are you calling pathetic?!</font>

234
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Watch your tongue, Captain Kuro!</font>

235
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, you used to be fearsome,</font>

236
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but that was three years ago!</font>

237
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's not like we were taking catnaps
while you lazed around the village!</font>

238
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's right!</font>

239
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We raided tons of towns and sent
loads of pirates to the bottom of the sea!</font>

240
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your point being...?</font>

241
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've done nothing for three years!</font>

242
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There's no way you can beat
the Meowban Brothers anymore!</font>

243
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Buchi, Sham, stop!</font>

244
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're not our captain anymore!</font>

245
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Sorry, but it's time to die!</font>

246
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wh-When did he get behind them?!</font>

247
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And those weapons...</font>

248
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's that about dying?</font>

249
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– He snuck...
– ...behind us!</font>

250
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?! He's gone!</font>

251
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There it is! The Pussyfoot Maneuver...</font>

252
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're right.</font>

253
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I suppose I have gotten a bit slower.</font>

254
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:52,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Zoro struggled with one sword, but this
guy handles them like they're kittens!</font>

255
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The Pussyfoot Maneuver
allows him to move about silently.</font>

256
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He could wipe out fifty assassins
before they even knew he was there!</font>

257
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We have no choice
but to carry out his plan!</font>

258
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I got chills when I saw
that habit of his three years later.</font>

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The strange way he lifts his glasses to avoid
cutting his own face with those cat claws...</font>

260
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">is clear proof that he still
knows how to fight!</font>

261
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I suppose I've gotten
a bit soft myself...</font>

262
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Three years on dry land
will do that to you...</font>

263
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So, I'll give you five minutes.</font>

264
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you can't clean up this mess
in the next five minutes...</font>

265
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll kill every last one of you...</font>

266
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">with my own two hands!</font>

267
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Five minutes...</font>

268
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Five minutes should be enough!</font>

269
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Him!</font>

270
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If we just beat him,
we can get past this hill!</font>

271
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We had the upper hand
against him just now!</font>

272
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We'll rip him to shreds in five minutes!</font>

273
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We're counting on you,
Meowban Brothers!</font>

274
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Zoro!</font>

275
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

276
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Hey!</font>

277
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're kicking my swords now?!</font>

278
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How about a "thank you"?</font>

279
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah...</font>

280
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Thanks!</font>

281
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's no use!</font>

282
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Three swords won't help...</font>

283
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">...if you don't know how to use 'em!</font>

284
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Tiger...</font>

285
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You don't get it, do you?</font>

286
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">...Trap!</font>

287
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Four minutes.</font>

288
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just having three swords
means nothing...</font>

289
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">if you don't know the three-sword style!</font>

290
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So...</font>

291
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So strong...</font>

292
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One hit...</font>

293
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-He beat the Meowban
Brothers in one hit!</font>

294
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't worry!</font>

295
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll take care of every last one of you
before your five minutes are up!</font>

296
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Three minutes.</font>

297
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I-I'll... slaughter him...</font>

298
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">C-Captain...</font>

299
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Hypnotize me...</font>

300
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">P-Please, Captain!</font>

301
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's alive.</font>

302
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You barely even scratched him.</font>

303
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Guess his extra padding saved him...</font>

304
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get him, Buchi!</font>

305
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hypnosis again?!</font>

306
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This guy's a pain.</font>

307
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He was already strong enough
to crack the ground.</font>

308
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What happens
when he's powered up?!</font>

309
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Now's my chance!</font>

310
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I gotta wake him up while I still can!</font>

311
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you up to now...?</font>

312
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Meddlesome girl...</font>

313
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Everyone else is getting their
ass kicked while he takes a nap!</font>

314
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Die!</font>

315
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get up!</font>

316
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami! Look out!</font>

317
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Split in two!</font>

318
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dodge!</font>

319
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wh-What the?!</font>

320
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A <i>chakram</i>!</font>

321
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It wasn't just for hypnosis?!</font>

322
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami! How dare you
stomp on my face!</font>

323
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-He's alive?!</font>

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Can't tell if he has
good or bad timing...</font>

325
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">L-Luffy...</font>

326
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy!</font>

327
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Ow...</font>

328
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Owww!</font>

329
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-He came back to life!</font>

330
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is bad!</font>

331
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No way five minutes is enough now!</font>

332
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami! That hurt, you jerk!</font>

333
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That wasn't me!</font>

334
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It wasn't...</font>

335
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">N-Nami?</font>

336
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Did you hurt your shoulder?</font>

337
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I-It's nothing. I'm fine...</font>

338
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I've done everything I can for now...</font>

339
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so I leave the rest to you...</font>

340
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We can't lose this fight
no matter what...</font>

341
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah!</font>

342
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do your best for the sake
of my treasure!</font>

343
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright! That sounds more like you!</font>

344
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One minute.</font>

345
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You can't be serious!</font>

346
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Not even Captain Jango and Buchi...</font>

347
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">...can finish them in one minute!</font>

348
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Buchi! There's no time to think!</font>

349
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Butcher that bellyband bastard!</font>

350
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll handle the weird brat...</font>

351
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Straw Hat is mine!</font>

352
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh? That butt-ler is here too!</font>

353
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Isn't that...</font>

354
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Didn't he fall off that cliff and die?</font>

355
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No matter.</font>

356
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do not approach me...</font>

357
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">from behind!</font>

358
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kaya!</font>

359
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp! Are you okay?!</font>

360
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">K-Kaya...</font>

361
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you doing here?!</font>

362
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm so sorry, Usopp...</font>

363
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I know you may not
accept my apology...</font>

364
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but I just couldn't believe it...!</font>

365
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">K-Klahadore, a pirate...</font>

366
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Forget about that!</font>

367
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why are you here?!</font>

368
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I told you to run away!</font>

369
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your life is in danger!</font>

370
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But... you're here fighting!</font>

371
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even after I treated you so horribly
and you've been hurt so badly,</font>

372
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">you're still fighting for me!</font>

373
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's why...</font>

374
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Miss Kaya...</font>

375
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why are you here?</font>

376
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">S-Stop this...</font>

377
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Stop this, Klahadore!</font>

378
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Merry told me everything.</font>

379
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Isn't that the girl from the mansion?</font>

380
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So she's the target of the plan?!</font>

381
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So we don't have to
go to the village now?</font>

382
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We just need to kill her, right?!</font>

383
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Klahadore, please!</font>

384
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you want my fortune,
you can have it all!</font>

385
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just leave this village!</font>

386
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">At once!</font>

387
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm more than happy to accept, but...</font>

388
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">there's one other thing
I want, you see...</font>

389
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What I want...</font>

390
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">is peace of mind.</font>

391
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Peace of mind...?</font>

392
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes. I want to be at peace.</font>

393
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I've spent three years earning
the trust of the villagers here.</font>

394
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><font color="#ffffff">The funny thing is, I've come
to take great comfort in that.</font></font>

395
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:46,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I want to have that sort
of peace forever...</font>

396
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And so...</font>

397
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And so I shall be given that peace!</font>

398
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">As well as your fortune...</font>

399
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In short, pirates <i>will</i>
come to the village!</font>

400
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Not only that...</font>

401
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but you will die
and leave behind your will!</font>

402
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">These two things are absolute.</font>

403
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">N-No...</font>

404
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Y-You're not...</font>

405
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Run! Run away, Kaya!
There's no use talking to him!</font>

406
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Run away!</font>

407
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Y-You're not Klahadore...</font>

408
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're not Klahadore!</font>

409
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kaya...</font>

410
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Leave this village!</font>

411
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right this second!</font>

412
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I see.</font>

413
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've certainly grown
a lot these past three years...</font>

414
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Miss Kaya.</font>

415
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you remember?</font>

416
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So much has happened
in three years...</font>

417
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We've spent so much time together...</font>

418
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even before your parents passed
away and you became bedridden...</font>

419
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So much time...</font>

420
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So many memories...</font>

421
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Together we suffered,
together we rejoiced...</font>

422
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">K-Klahadore...</font>

423
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We would visit the city together...</font>

424
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and I would always look after you
when you had a fever...</font>

425
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You listened to my stories
with a smile on your face...</font>

426
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I devoted myself to you...</font>

427
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">For so long...</font>

428
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, for so long...</font>

429
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I endured it all...</font>

430
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:51,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, I endured it all for this
very day when I could finally kill you!</font>

431
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I, the man once known
as Captain Kuro,</font>

432
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">had to debase myself and put on
a smile for some snot-nosed girl!</font>

433
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I cast aside my nature
and ingratiated myself to you!</font>

434
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Damn you...</font>

435
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you understand how humiliating
it was, day in and day out?</font>

436
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you understand what that meant
for the man once known as Captain Kuro?!</font>

437
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kuro!</font>

438
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Come to think of it...</font>

439
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I still owe you for hitting me.</font>

440
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp!</font>

441
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">As I recall, you struck me
with everything you had...</font>

442
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:27,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you hate getting hit that much,
I got a hundred more punches for you!</font>
