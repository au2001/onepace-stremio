122

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No way! He'll kill someone
just for having a weapon?!</font>

we've paid your tribute money!</font>

127
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why would we want to 
rebel now, of all times?!</font>

128

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take your hands off Gen{-san}!</font>

246
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Apparently, there's a long-nosed
outsider running all over the place.</font>

247
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{He locked up his friend here - OG}Another one is already locked up here{arch}</font>

250
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Guess I'll save him for now.</font>

251
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This Cocoyashi Village...</font>

252
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How do I get there?</font>

253
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get in.</font>

254
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Hm?</font>

255
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're a guest.
I'll take you there, swordsman!</font>

256
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's that?</font>

257
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A sea monster!</font>

258
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's a cow! It's huge!</font>

259
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A cow? They don't swim.
It's gotta be a hippo.</font>

260
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's something like this
doing in the East Blue?!</font>

261
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is a Grand Line creature!</font>

262
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? What's this guy doing?</font>

263
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's after the food!</font>

264
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">What?!</font>

265
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hurry and give it to him!
He'll flip the boat over!</font>

266
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gum-Gum Pistol!</font>

267
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stay away from my food!</font>

268
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You did it! You're incredible,
Big Bro Luffy!</font>

269
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Looks like you made it mad!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Another one, huh?! - OG}Need another one, huh?!{arch: he means another punch, so I'm making that clearer}</font>

271
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">You dumbass!</font>

272
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't beat up someone who's 
hungry for no reason!</font>

273
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's probably hurt or something
and can't catch his own food.</font>

274
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Right?</font>

275
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How sweet.</font>

276
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here, eat up. No need to hold back.</font>

277
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Die, you damn thing!</font>

278
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What're you doing?!
What happened to that sweetness?!</font>

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The bastard just tried to eat me, too.</font>

280
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here he comes!
He's gonna sink the boat!</font>

281
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– That jerk!
– Get back. I'll do it.</font>

282
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Collier Shoot!</font>

283
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Damn hippo!</font>

284
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{All right! Back to food!}All right! Back to eating!{arch: or maybe "Back to the food" (this here is lit. though), but just "Back to food" sounds too shortened even for Luffy}</font>

285
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That was good exercise.</font>

286
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">These guys are crazy.</font>

287
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here's Cocoyashi Village.</font>

288
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong{-san} should be here.</font>

289
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Great. Thanks.</font>

290
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No problem! Bye, now!</font>

291
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Whoops! I just remembered,
I forgot to ask your name!</font>

292
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? Me? What are you
asking my name again for?</font>

293
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,580

294
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Come back again!</font>

295
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What a strange guy.</font>

296
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What the hell happened?!</font>

297
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,700

301
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Roronoa Zoro!</font>

302
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">What?!</font>

Th-That's how we do it in my village!</font>

315
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But you are one of Zoro's men.</font>

316
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Though, it's only natural for famous
bounty hunters to come after me.</font>

317
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't kill me! I don't have
anything to do with Zoro!</font>

318
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Enough of your blatant lies.
You stood up to Arlong{-san}, too.</font>

319
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Doesn't look like you're
going to live either way.</font>

320
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">H-Hey! As a matter of fact,
Zoro and I are really close!</font>

321
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So just try and lay a finger on me!
Zoro won't stand by quietly!</font>

322
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh? Which means if I kill you,
Zoro will come back?</font>

323
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">N-No, you're wrong!</font>

324
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Killing me would be very bad!
If you keep me alive, Zoro'll show up!</font>

325
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But if you don't keep me alive,
Zoro won't come!</font>

326
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But how exactly did Zoro...</font>

327
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">escape from our prison?</font>

328
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What do you mean?</font>

329
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What I mean is, 
someone let him escape.</font>

330
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong{-san}. Does this
sound plausible to you?</font>

331
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Perhaps Nami let Zoro infiltrate this place so he could take your head?</font>

332
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">N-Now that you mention it,
Nami has been acting strange lately.</font>

333
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. She even helped Zoro
when he jumped into the water.</font>

334
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't tell me she was working
with Zoro from the very start.</font>

335
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She tricked us all?!</font>

336
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Betrayal is her specialty.</font>

337
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's enough of that!</font>

338
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't go any further based
on a bunch of conjecture!</font>

339
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

340
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Watch what you say!</font>

341
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Me, a traitor?</font>

342
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Eight years ago, I got this tattoo 
as my oath of loyalty to this crew!</font>

343
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sorry, sorry.</font>

344
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami. It's only natural
for you to be upset.</font>

345
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But rest easy.
I don't suspect you one bit.</font>

346
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We've known each other 
for eight years now!</font>

347
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We were just a little on edge is all.</font>

348
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Right, Nami?</font>

349
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The ones we do need to get rid of
are Roronoa Zoro and his group!</font>

350
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">H-Hey, Nami! S-Say something!</font>

351
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

352
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro just had to go and do that.</font>

353
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's wrong, Nami?</font>

354
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You seem a little pale.</font>

355
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But, as for long-nose here...</font>

356
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">not even you can save him now.</font>

357
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Not after he's defied Arlong{-san}.</font>

358
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How long...</font>

359
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How long are you going to suspect me?!</font>

360
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're too smart, you see.</font>

361
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll have the amount Arlong 
and I agreed to soon!</font>

362
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why would I betray you now?!</font>

363
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Agreed amount?!</font>

364
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I know.</font>

365
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You agreed eight years ago to buy
Cocoyashi Village from Arlong{-san}</font>

366
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">for 100 million belly.</font>

367
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But I just can't make sense of it.</font>

368
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You betrayed the villagers and your parent, and you only trust money,</font>

369
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so why do you care so much
about Cocoyashi Village?</font>

370
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why such a puny little village?</font>

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Actually, I found this... in your room.</font>

372
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Th-That's my...</font>

373
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">S-Say what?! 
Usopp's been captured?!</font>

374
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah! They took him to
Arlong Park a little while ago!</font>

375
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Brave as he was, 
that youngster defied Arlong!</font>

376
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's surely dead by now!</font>

377
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Damn.</font>

378
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Of all times to get caught, it had
to be after I killed some time there!</font>

379
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Usopp! Don't die on me!</font>

380
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go! To Arlong Park!</font>

381
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hang on, Nami!</font>
