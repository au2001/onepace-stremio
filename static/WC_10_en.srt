119
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably because he wishes he were dead.</font>

238
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, in a way, we <i>are</i> obeying Mama!</font>

 my hard biscuit soldiers</font>

243
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We figured out your weakness, but that doesn't mean you should take it out on my soldiers!</font>

244
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your?!</font>

245
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we...</font>

246
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,100

247
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?</font>

248
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sorry!</font>

249
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's put an end to this, biscuit soldiers!</font>

250
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This should end it!</font>

251
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I gotta eat them.
They'll keep coming if I break them.</font>

255
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,170

256
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami, can I try something other than eating them?</font>

257
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll fight them for a while, and then continue.</font>

258
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weather Egg!</font>

259
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care if you're related to an emperor...</font>

260
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's going to be the pirate king!</font>

261
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So there's no limit to his appetite!</font>

262
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Nami, I've been eating all night!</font>

263
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is his stomach bottomless?</font>

264
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

265
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rain Spark!</font>

266
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldiers are going to soften up again! Stop!</font>

267
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... I can't...</font>

268
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me, Sanji!</font>

269
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

270
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that gluttony!</font>

271
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,620
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Germa 66</font></font></font>

272
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,620
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Germa 66</font></font>

273
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Generalissimo Judge, it is time.</font>

274
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The preparations are complete.</font>

275
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good, inform my children.</font>

276
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're leaving for Whole Cake Chateau!</font>

277
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ready? This might sting a little.</font>

278
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hurry up and do it.</font>

279
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels a little weird...</font>

280
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch it.</font>

281
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How does it feel?</font>

282
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The swelling has gone down.</font>

283
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch!</font>

284
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pack only works for swelling.</font>

285
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's suppressing the body's normal response,
so it's actually preventing it from healing.</font>

286
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's better than your fiancée seeing your swollen face.</font>

287
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The members of the Charlotte family 
don't take their spouses' family name.</font>

288
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if they accept you as a part of their family,
 you can live a happy life.</font>

289
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you...</font>

290
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You came back on your own.
I don't owe you anything.</font>

291
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't get another chance.</font>

292
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, where did you 
pick up that sense of chivalry?</font>

293
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Women! Women! Women! Women!</i></font>

294
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Women!</i></font>

295
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shut up! We don't need a female chef!</i></font>

296
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cut it out!</i></font>

297
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm the type of man that 
reinforces my lessons through kicks.</i></font>

298
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't do that to a woman!</i></font>

299
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why not?! If she doesn't listen, then just kick her, too!</i></font>

300
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You idiot!</i></font>

301
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ouch!</i></font>

302
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A man can't kick a woman!</i></font>

303
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's been the rule
since the age of the dinosaurs!</i></font>

304
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen, little eggplant!</i></font>

305
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You can make all kinds
of mistakes as a human being!</i></font>

306
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But if you ever fail at being a proper man,</i></font>

307
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll cut off your balls,
and slit my own throat!</i></font>

308
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?! Why would you do that to yourself?!</i></font>

309
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's how a parent owns up to their {own }mistake!</i></font>

310
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You fool... Don't become
the type of person I despise.</i></font>

311
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now, get back to work.</i></font>

312
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's been the rule 
since the age of the dinosaurs.</font>

313
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, Your Highness, it's time to leave.</font>

314
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You all are going to the engagement ceremony at Whole Cake Chateau.</font>

315
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put this shirt on.</font>

316
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a member of the Vinsmoke royal family.</font>

317
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to look the part.</font>

318
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a joke...</font>

323
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's back!</font>

324
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't escape!</font>

325

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a great wedding ceremony!</font>

328
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,650

330
