132
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The time has come, captain.</font>

133
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This battle is to restore the honor of King Riku, who was dethroned in shame ten years ago,{The second half of this line was originally in the line below. But since 1: this line is on screen for way longer, and 2: it matches the Japanese better this way, I moved it here. -Starfish}</font>

134
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and to regain our freedom!</font>

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never forget that man's tyranny
when he came here and stole everything!</font>

136
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've spent a year preparing for this.</font>

137
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we're up against a Warlord's crew,
we still have a chance!</font>

138
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll listen carefully to the plan,
and figure out the best time to run away.</font>

140
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to turn left soon, Zoroland.</font>

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Left is the side that you don't have your swords on. {God this is awkward wording, fix please.}</font>

142
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think I don't know left from right?!</font>

143
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

144
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your ship is being attacked by
a female commander of the Donquixote Family, Jora.</font>

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She uses art to incapacitate her opponents. She is quite a formidable foe.</font>

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know a lot about her.</font>

147
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know the names, faces and powers of all of the Family's commanders.</font>

148
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Especially the top three commanders who annihilated Dressrosa's army all on their own.</font>

149
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:44,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol, Diamante and Pica.{I've noticed that there seems to be some inconsistency with whether the annoying slimey dude's name is spelled as Trebol or Trébol. For the record I believe the latter would be more accurate, unless Oda has actually specified that it's meant to be spelled the other way. (Trébol is Spanish for clover, as in the card. Likewise, Pica is Spanish for spade, so I changed that too to fit the pun.) -Starfish}
There's no way I could ever forget their faces.</font>

150
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years ago?</font>

151
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just how old are you?</font>

152
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm 27 years old.</font>

153
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,870

154
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

155
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way!</font>

156
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-dono! Zoro-dono! Over here!</font>

157
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

158
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're being too loud, you idiot!</font>

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that? They're acting like they know us.</font>

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swirly-Eyebrowland and Topknotland.</font>

161
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

162
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're going to save Nami-san?</font>

163
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then she really is in danger.</font>

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder she wasn't picking up the Snail Phone.</font>

165
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'm going too!</font>

166
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Sanji-dono.</font>

167
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here to inform Luffy-dono of the situation, remember?</font>

168

170
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope you get passionately stabbed.</font>

171
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your ship has been captured by Jora.</font>

172
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now it's headed for Green Bit!</font>

173
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is so much fun! { This is such a mood whiplash! -Starfish }</font>

174
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a beautiful marriage
between the music and art of the ocean! Yeah!</font>

175
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like the way you talk!</font>

176
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop the ship!
You're not heading for Green Bit, are you?!</font>

177
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law has quite a shock in store for him!</font>

178
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's expecting you,
but I shall be the one who comes to fetch Caesar!</font>

179
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook's acting strange. How could he betray us?</font>

180
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet you call yourself a swordsman, Sir Bone?!</font>

181
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have found myself!
I am an artist through and through.</font>

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Creating beautiful art is what I live for!</font>

These commoners will never understand, Soul King! { def: 'philistines' plays into her snooty speech, but it may be too much (originally 'commoners') }</font>

185
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your true passion is for expressing yourself! They can never understand that.</font>

186
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,610

187
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,540

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nooo!</font>

189
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help!</font>

190
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This does not hurt!</font>

191
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You needn't say a thing! I know I have flawlessly portrayed the tragedy that occurred on Dressrosa.</font>

204
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this, Jora-san.</font>

205
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see,
the bow of my violin is in fact a sword in a cane.</font>

206
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope that it plays exquisite music.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll just do it quietly and carefully.</font>

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How would that make a difference?</font>

254
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Pirate Hunter Zoro-senpai!{Orgasm}{BartoRomeo-chan XD}</font>

255
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three-sword-style user whose legend began
when he cut down a hundred men on Whiskey Peak...</font>

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and on Enies Lobby
they say he sliced the entire island in half!</font>

257
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's been supporting the crew as Luffy-senpai's right hand man!</font>

258
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the famous first mate of the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

259
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so freaking cool!</font>

260
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? My tears won't stop...</font>

261
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,490
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa Royal Palace</font>

262
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Gladius, you really should calm down.</font>

263
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Baby 5.</font>

264
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea how much
that woman's betrayal has messed up our plans?</font>

265
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damn Violet was supposed to capture Black Leg Sanji and read his mind to learn the enemy's plan.</font>

266
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were supposed to hinder their plans at every step, and take out every single one of the Straw Hats!</font>

267
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now look what's happened!
She took out her own subordinates and ran away! {Xemnas: The word used here "Shitomete" generally implies that she killed them and as we're not sure whether she killed them or not, I used this wording which leaves it ambiguous either way as to whether she killed them or just knocked them out.}</font>

268
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down!
You don't want to explode in here, do you?! {Xemnas: Isn't that ichigo's sword from bleach?}</font>

269
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is nothing I hate more than
people who can't stay on schedule or follow a plan!</font>

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,650
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Donquixote Family (Pica Army)
Gladius</font>

271
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone who betrays us...
or rather, betrays the young master, must die.</font>

272
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Violet has been acting strange ever since last night.</font>

273
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just think about it. She could easily have found
the Straw Hats' ship yesterday using her Clairvoyance. { def: clairvoyance capitalized? }{Xemnas: I think it should be, since it's also the name of her ability.}</font>

274
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,680
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Northeast Dressrosa
Heading Towards Green Bit</font>

275
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Violet-chan!</font>

276
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should have waited at the port, as we planned. {literally "the promised port" -Starfish}</font>

277
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That port is already crawling with marines.</font>

278
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should change your rendezvous point.</font>

279
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so the Navy's here.</font>

280
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've got a total of four warships here.</font>

281
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So there are at least 3,000 marines
in this country right now.{She strictly speaking says there are at least "over three thousand", but to me the like "at least over X" sounds weird... Saying that there are at least three thousand indicates that there are probably more anyway. -Starfish}</font>

282
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you figure out so much on your own
in such a short amount of time?</font>

283
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I have the power of Clairvoyance.</font>

284
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can send my line of sight flying like a bird
in any direction, up to 4,000 kilometers away.</font>

285
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see everything that happens in this country,
without lifting a finger.</font>

286
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you don't have to worry about me.</font>

287
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't get captured.</font>

288
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean you're staying in the country?</font>

289
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, don't worry.</font>

290
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to...</font>

291
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

292
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How horrible! Your ship suddenly reappeared and was struck by lightning!</font>

293
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lightning?!</font>

294
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, that probably means...</font>

295
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,390
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Waters off Dressrosa</font>

296
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, what should we do with her?</font>

297
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir Bone, I hit her hard.</font>

298
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, your muscles are well-developed.</font>

299
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Really? I have strong muscles?</font>

300
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really want to throw her in the ocean.</font>

301
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since she's a Devil Fruit ability user.</font>

302
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I have no desire to see her panties.</font>

303
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Who are you calling Miss Universe?</font>

304
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not what I said! No one said that!</font>

305
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should I hit her once more?</font>

306
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't bother with her.</font>

307
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to hurry to Traf.</font>

308
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, what did he mean when he told us to pick up Caesar?</font>

309
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen up, you have to... {copy past from 648}</i></font>

310
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>set sail for Green Bit right now!</i></font>

311
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm leaving Caesar in your care! {end copy paste} {Cecil: There was a mistake in that CP, which worries me XD}</i></font>

312
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, this is a strange situation.</font>

313
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since Doflamingo agreed to our demands and threw away his position as a Warlord,</font>

314
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar should be returned to him.</font>

315
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys really don't know anything.</font>

316
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way the young master would take some kids' demands seriously.</font>

317
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The young master has not thrown away his position as a Warlord.</font>

318
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, what do you mean by that?</font>

319
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

320
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow! That hurts, you little brat!</font>

321
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Onami!</font>

322
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've all fallen into his trap.</font>

323
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surely by now, Violet will have exposed all your plans. You can be sure your crewmates have been caught! {Halee: How about rewording the 2d sentence as: "You can be sure your crewmates have been caught."}</font>

324
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,180
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Green Bit</font>

325
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,130
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Law vs.
Doflamingo and Admiral Fujitora</font>

326
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were a Celestial Dragon, Doflamingo?!</font>

327
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I <i>was.</i></font>

328
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a Celestial Dragon anymore.</font>

329
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do bloodlines and destiny mean anyway?</font>

330
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think there is anyone else in the world who's led a life as checkered as mine.</font>

331
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd have loved to talk to you about my life before I met you, over a drink.</font>

332
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't have the time for it.</font>

333
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to do something about the
Straw Hat Crew over in Dressrosa.</font>

334
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Many people have made the fatal mistake of underestimating them.</font>

335
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Fujitora?</font>

336
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

337
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard some lightning coming from the sea.</font>

338
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does the sky look like? {Xemnas: He's asking if there are cumulonimbus clouds in the sky or not.} {Halee: Unless it's some speech quirk from Fujitora, it should read "What DOES the sky look like?"}</font>

339
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lightning?</font>

340
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may be blind, but I thought I could read the weather fairly well.</font>

341
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I'm getting old.</font>

342
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I remember, Namier could control the weather.</font>

343
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the ship has come.</font>

344
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Joker, if you've gotten it back, then hurry and give it to me!</font>

345
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart, my heart!</font>

346
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hurry!</font>

347
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never said that was Caesar's heart.</font>

348
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

349
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what you used to threaten me!</font>

350
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, my heart isn't inside my chest!</font>

351
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong, get a hold of yourself!</font>

352
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

353
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A marine's?!</font>

354
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then where's mine?!</font>

355
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was my subordinate's scream.</font>

356
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, Heavenly Demon?</font>

357
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Room!</font>

358
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should've paid attention to your gravity, Fujitora.</font>

359
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting out of here.</font>

360
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shambles!</font>

361
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker, save me!</font>

362
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think you had this much strength left, Law.</font>

363
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't know when to give up.</font>

364
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, let go of me, Law!</font>

365
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you put my heart?!</font>

366
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit wasting my time, you brat.</font>

367
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know there's no place to run.</font>

368
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you see Traf?</font>

369
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see very well because of the fog.</font>

370
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I do see a strange forest.</font>

371
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If... if Traf's plan failed, and we take back Caesar, what happens?</font>

372
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo will target us.</font>

373
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How scary!</font>

374
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

375
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?!</font>

376
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something in the ocean!</font>

377
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I-It's a school of Fighting Fish!</font>

378
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You came too close to the island!</font>

379
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they?</font>

380
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're killer fish that can sink warships!</font>

381
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Onami!</font>

382
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me, Doflamingo!</font>

383
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he targets the ship, then we're out.</font>

384
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll draw him to the bridge, and then throw Caesar from there.</font>

385
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I begin a fight with Doflamingo on top of the bridge, I can buy plenty of time for the ship to escape.</font>

386
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

387
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you trying to cross the bridge?</font>

388
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't understand.</font>

389
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you go to Dressrosa, then you're in my territory.</font>

390
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, those guys...</font>

391
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what you were planning.</font>

392
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Doflamingo! They have nothing to do with this!</font>

393
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over, Law!</font>

394
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo's flying toward us!</font>

395
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master!</font>

396
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this nightmare?!</font>

397
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we gonna die?!</font>

398
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No!</i></font>

399
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch closely, Law.</font>

400
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your allies are going to die a pathetic death right before your eyes!</font>

401
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

402
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Traf, hel-</font>

403
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

404
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come anywhere near my crying crewmates!</font>

405
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

406
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, here's a strong-looking one.</font>
