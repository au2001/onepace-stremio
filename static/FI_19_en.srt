00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper?</font>

137
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me.</font>

138
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?</font>

139
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll treat your wounds right away.</font>

140
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darling!  Stay awake!</font>

141
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Daddy!</font>

142
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and treat their wounds!  Quickly!</font>

143
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Hody.
He even attacked defenseless citizens!</font>

144
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the princess... alright?</font>

145
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

146
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm sure...</font>

147
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she's still fighting for us!</font>

148
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly.
What will happen to Fishman Island? </font>

149
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will it really be destroyed?!</font>

150
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to take it away.  Far away!</font>

151
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure are desperate.</font>

152
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Away from the island...</font>

153
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah!</font>

154
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

155
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Noah falls, it's all over!</font>

156
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!  She can't hear us!</font>

157
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't swim straight up!</font>

158
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the side!  Move to the side!</font>

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they've caught on?!</font>

160
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

161
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

162
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,630

163
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't interfere with my plan!</font>

164
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!  Hang in there!</font>

165
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Decken's power doesn't stop working here, then what was the point of killing him?</font>

166
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's it!</font>

167
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't move, then the ship will crash down onto Fishman Island and everyone there!</font>

168
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After Weak-hoshi worked so hard to draw it away from the island!</font>

169
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro-hoshi!  Let's go to Weak-hoshi!</font>

170
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

171
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shirahoshi!</i></font>

174
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island will be crushed, along with all of its people!</font>

175
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, all your companions are sure to die as well!</font>

176
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?!</font>

177
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

178
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Swim to the side!</i></font>

179
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shirahoshi!</i></font>

180
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,690

181
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weak-hoshi!</font>

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn mermaid!</font>

183
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How insolent!</font>

184
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi heard us!</font>

185
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's swimming to the side!</font>

186
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't have done that!</font>

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you!</font>

188
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wait!</i></font>

189
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go!</font>

190
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't letting go!</font>

191
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it...</font>

192
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah!  Come this way!</font>

193
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm losing my grip...</font>

194
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah!  Follow me!</font>

195
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

196
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

197
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Decken!  Just die already!</font>

198
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it.</font>

199
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard, Hody.  I won't let him get away with this!</font>

200
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah!  I'm right here!</font>

201
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship... It's starting to move to the side!</font>

202
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Great!  Keep going, Weak-hoshi!</i></font>

203
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shirahoshi!</i></font>

204
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go!</i></font>

205
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My left hand's target...</font>

206
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody, it's you!</font>

207
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember that!</font>

208
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until you die...</font>

209
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will always be hunting you, body and soul!</font>

210
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah!</font>

211
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!  Just a little further!</font>

212
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it moves too far, all of this was pointless!</font>

213
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the way to the ends of hell!</font>

214
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Noah... is falling!</font>

215
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just in time!</font>

216
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island...</font>

217
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is still in danger!</font>

218
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be!</font>

219
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Victory is mine!</i></font>

220
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he finally bought it.</font>

221
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now Vander Decken's power will stop working,
and the Noah will crash down onto Fishman Island!</font>

222
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die!  Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

223
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fools have gotten in the way of my retribution.</font>

224
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island's going to...</font>

225
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...be destroyed.</font>

226
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One way or another, we have to stop the ship.</font>

227
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

228
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna stop the Noah, don't you?</font>

229
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard.</font>

230
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Noah crashes into Fishman Island,
then it's all over.</font>

231
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our kingdom and the centuries-old mission
to protect the Noah.</font>

232
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen, my sons.</i></font>

233
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That Ark, the Noah, isn't just a historical ruin.</i></font>

234
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A long time ago, hundreds of years past,
we exchanged promises with a very important person.</i></font>

235
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That ship has been waiting patiently
on the ocean floor to carry out that promise.</i></font>

236
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The ship has not yet completed its mission.</i></font>

237
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And now, even the techniques used to build the ship
have been lost in time.</i></font>

238
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Until the promised day comes,
we mustn't allow the Noah to get a single scratch!</i></font>

239
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We understand, Father.</i></font>

240
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We will find out what's causing it to move
and deal with it appropriately.</i></font>

241
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We have to save our kingdom and the Noah,
no matter the cost!</i></font>

242
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was it just a bluff when you said that
you would protect everyone, Straw Hat?!</font>

243
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna stop it!</font>

244
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll smash that boat into smithereens before it hits the island!</font>

245
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't even say that!</font>

246
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even <i>if</i> you could do it, I already told you that the Noah holds both our past and future.</font>

247
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then is there another way we can save the island?</font>

248
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time to think.</font>

249
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What else can we do?</font>

250
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decken may still be alive.</font>

251
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we get him to wake up, we might be able to
make him change the ship's course!</font>

252
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You say that, but what if he's dead?</font>

253
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't hurry up and destroy the ship-</font>

254
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to stop saying that!</font>

255
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two gonna start fighting?</font>

256
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at what's happening while you two squabble.</font>

257
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah's gonna crash into Fishman Island.</font>

258
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait, Noah!</font>

259
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are many people on the island who are precious to me!</font>

260
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decken-sama!</font>

261
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,070

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

270
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama?!</font>

271
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit.</font>

272
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My Color of Arms is good against blunt strikes,</font>

273
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it's useless against this kind of attack.</font>

274
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My Haki still needs training.</font>

275
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have the time to fight underwater.</font>

276
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm gonna kick his ass, we have to move.</font>

277
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, you want to fight on this falling ship?</font>

278
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what you really want must be...</font>

279
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the air on board!</font>

280
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I get on board,
I can take out that bastard Hody in a single hit!</font>

281
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was worried he might do this!</font>

282
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bubbles will break
if you tear a big enough hole in them!</font>

283
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, there isn't any air on the deck anymore!</font>

284
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By now you must know that humans, who are helpless in situations like this, truly are inferior to fishmen!</font>

285
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in no position to think about stopping the Noah.</font>

286
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't even beat me!</font>

287
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die, Straw Hat!</font>

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

289
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama.</font>

290
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm incredibly sorry, but...</font>

291
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weak-hoshi?</font>

292
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi told me to do this.</font>

293
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro-hoshi.</font>

294
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody!</font>

295
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what are you trying to do?!</font>

296
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you realize how many lives there are on that island?!</font>

297
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro-hoshi.</font>

298
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi dearest.</font>

299
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you only have fake strength,</font>

300
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that I couldn't stand up to you
means that I'm still inexperienced.  I'll admit that.</font>

301
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there is still hope!</font>

302
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Hody, why?!</font>

303
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you trying to kill so many of your innocent brethren?</font>

304
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what is your goal?!</font>

305
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What drove you to do something so terrible, Hody?!</font>

306
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die!</font>

307
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi dearest!</font>

308
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fake strength like that can't beat me!</font>

309
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you managed to survive?</font>

310
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody, what are you trying to do?!</font>

311
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You say you want retribution against the humans,
but you're attacking fishmen.</font>

312
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you know how many of your fishmen brethren you're going to kill on Fishman Island?!</font>

313
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're even going to kill
your childhood friends from Fishman District.</font>

314
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know what you're doing?!</font>

315
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:51,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have so much hatred for humans that you've become blind with rage?</font>

316
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could have happened to you?</font>

317
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you abused by humans?</font>

318
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did the humans kill
a loved one or a dear friend of yours?</font>

319
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could have possibly happened to make you do this?</font>

320
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me, Hody!</font>

321
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what did the humans do to you?!</font>

322
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi dearest!</font>

323
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weak-hoshi...</font>

324
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy-san.</font>

325
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Air Tank.</font>

326
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one you met earlier.</font>

327
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been briefed on this terrible situation.</font>

328
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our sensors have detected the falling Noah.</font>

329
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Preparations are proceeding according to plan.</font>

330
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is what Bro-hoshi was talking about earlier.</font>

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Is there something you want on the deck?
Then I'll get there first. </i></font>

332
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hody!</i></font>

333
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Follow him!</i></font>

334
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No.  Wait, Straw Hat.</i></font>

335
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why do we have to wait?!</i></font>

336
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You should have learned by now.</i></font>

337
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Fighting in the water is
devastatingly favorable for a fishman like Hody.</i></font>

338

339
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So what'll we do?!</i></font>

340
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I have a plan.</i></font>

341
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey! Where're you going, Bro-hoshi!</i></font>

342
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Prince Fukaboshi.</i></font>

343
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What has happened, Prince?</i></font>

344
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We may need a large amount of air soon.
Prepare it at once.</i></font>

345
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>

346
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It'll be fine.  Isn't there air on the deck?</i></font>

347
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll just defeat him there!</i></font>

348
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Leaving aside the problem of Decken,
do you think Hody will just fight you on your terms?</i></font>

349
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Take this Baby Snail Phone with you,

351
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, whatever shall you do about the Noah?</font>

352
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  You there?</font>

353
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How're you gonna give us that air?</font>

354
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll use all of the air in the Air Tank.</font>

355
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Air Tank?  What's that?</font>

356
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an air transporting device,
used to deliver air to Fishman Island.</font>

357
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we use the air in the Air Tank to create a bubble,
it should be possible to completely enclose the Noah.</font>

358
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the bubble disables buoyancy,
so the air won't cause the Noah to float.</font>

359
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, it won't stop the Noah's descent.</font>

360
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, to get a bubble big enough to enclose the Noah
we'll have to use all the air we have.</font>

361
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we only get one shot.</font>

362
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have one split second when the Noah is directly beside us and if we miss...</font>

363
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there'll be no second chance.</font>

364
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't understand all that...</font>

365
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but basically, it's all or nothing?</font>

366
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir.  I wish we could do more,
but all we can do is entrust everything to you.</font>

367
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're incredibly sorry for putting you in this position-</font>

368
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me how hard it is!
Just hurry up and give the air to me!</font>

369
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as I have air, I'll manage!</font>

370
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger that.</font>

371
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll do everything in our power to help you.</font>

372
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san, we leave Fishman Island to you!</font>

373

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat.  Shirahoshi.</font>

374
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think you'll accomplish by staying with the Noah's descent?</font>

375
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just the sort of idiocy I expect from a human and the Mermaid Princess!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, human.  Give up, human.</font>

380
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just looking at you makes my skin crawl.</font>

381
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I shorten my life...</font>

382
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how many bystanders are hurt...</font>

383
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will have my revenge on you humans.</font>

384

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Hody.</font>

385
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You absolutely can't miss.  We only get one chance.</font>

386
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,380
