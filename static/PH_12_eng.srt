<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying, Tashigi!? How can you even think of appealing to these pirates!?</font>

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to beg for our lives! If it takes groveling on our knees then so be it!</font>

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we die here, then we'll be letting all our men die too!</font>

135
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then Vice Admiral Vergo-</font>

136
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we allow Vergo to do as he likes, then even more children will...</font>

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like the woman is a little smarter than you are.</font>

138
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Little White Hunter, I have no obligation to save you at all,</font>

139
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if sparing your lives will put Vergo at a disadvantage then that will benefit me.</font>

140
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, you'd best forget everything you heard about me and Joker.</font>

141
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:27,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is not a request. It's the condition for sparing your lives.</font>

142
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's goin' on out there?</font>

143
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I'm finally out!</font>

144
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing!?</font>

145
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait!</font>

146
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll just do what he wants if he's out of the cage!</font>

147
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like that chain link stuff is made outta Sea Stone. </font>

148
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Trafal-guy!</font>

149
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do I get inside?</font>

150
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Bro, I'd rather go and grab the Sunny.</font>

151
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever.</font>

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that look for?</font>

153
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Run!</i></font>

154
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we're running in this strange manner it's still catching up to us!</font>

155
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The dragon's getting further and further away!</font>

156
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta catch the damn thing and fly away now!</font>

157
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't go on!</font>

158
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san! Don't give up!</font>

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use, Nami-san's heart and lungs are about to give out!</font>

160
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My chest hurts!</font>

161
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My chest...</font>

162
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I caught him!</font>

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of bizarre power up was that!?</font>

164
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That smoke is closing in!</font>

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With a color that creepy it's gonna be deadly poison for sure!</font>

166
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, Brownybeard, for asking you to carry us while you're so badly wounded.</font>

167
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem. It's only like carrying a couple of little dwarfs. Never mind that, I've gotta save my men!</font>

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta get the kids too! I hope they haven't had any candy yet!</font>

169
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's that over there?</font>

170
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, there're people being chased by the gas.</font>

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dragon?</font>

172
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shutter opened!</font>

173
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an emergency!</font>

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shutters have been raised!</font>

175
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who touched the lever!?</font>

176
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! The G-5 marines are flooding in here!</font>

177
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, over there!</font>

178
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Vice Admiral Smoker from the Navy's G-5!</font>

179
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Trafalgar Law!</font>

180
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the pirate Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

181
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, weren't they all captured by Master!?</font>

182
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness, everyone got inside!</font>

183
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, what to do about my heart?</font>

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is gonna be cool!</font>

185
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel pathetic just being near you guys.</font>

186
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch!</font>

188
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang on a minute! Wait! Wait!</font>

189
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shutter's closing!</font>

190
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, we just got here!</font>

191
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open it! We've gotta get inside!</font>

192
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use, we're gonna be locked out and killed by all the gas!</font>

193
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not too late, we're not dead yet!</font>

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Kin'emon, can you cut iron?</font>

195
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing can hinder my sword!</font>

196
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard, keep going like this!</font>

197
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They cut a hole in the shutter!</i></font>

198
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you're all here!</font>

199
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

200
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're back!</font>

201
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Let's go wild!</font>

202
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What've you done!?</font>

203
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's great we made it inside, but the poison gas can get in too!</font>

205
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys serious!? You tryin' to kill us all along with you!?</font>

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, patch up that hole!</font>

207
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otherwise we're done for!</font>

208
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over!</font>

209
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no longer anywhere for life to exist on Punk Hazard!</font>

210
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There're still great clouds of it everywhere.</font>

211
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just one step outside in this stuff and you'd be done for.</font>

212
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's it like, Brook?</font>

213
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, kinda like a world of death.</font>

214
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just imagine if we hadn't patched up that hole.</font>

215
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes me shudder.</font>

216
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You make us shudder!</i></font>

217
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, good!</font>

218
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not good at all! You thoughtless bastards could've killed everyone here!</font>

219
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we fixed the hole!</font>

220
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You pirates mess about even more than people say!</font>

221
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give up now Straw Hat crew! And you too, pirate Brownbeard!</font>

222
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!? Now it feels like we're backed into a corner! There's nowhere to run!</font>

223
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that even a problem?</font>

224
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, this is pretty normal for us.</font>

225
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They should just give up now.</font>

226
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, they knew my name!</font>

227
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's kicking off down there!</font>

228
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two, don't get in the way of his crew and don't get in my way either, understand?</font>

229
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

230
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Trafal-guy, wait a moment!</font>

231
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over here, over here!</font>

232
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up! Switch us back!</font>

233
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have to!</font>

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! My dream is over!</font>

235
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back! But, wait a moment...</font>

236
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun!?</font>

237
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is this coat different!? Did you take off my clothes!?</font>

238
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's more to it than that...</font>

239
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? My body?</font>

240
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't damage from that punch just now.</font>

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, yeah, Nami got your body pretty badly smashed up by Caesar.</font>

242
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!?</font>

243
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad it was my body that got battered instead.</font>

244
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so proud of you! So very, very proud!</font>

245
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone here, listen carefully!</font>

246
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law!</font>

247
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This laboratory is totally surrounded by poison gas,</font>

248
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's a passage that bypasses the outside air and allows for escape directly to sea.</font>

249
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a giant door with R-66 written on it, that is the entrance to the passage out to sea.</font>

250
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a fan of mass murder, so I'll give you all two hours.</font>

251
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Any longer than that and I cannot guarantee the lives of anyone in this laboratory.</font>

252
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will something happen to the lab?</font>

253
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a possibility. Right now, I just have to do what I have to do.</font>

254
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, alright then.</font>

255
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin, I have a favor to ask.</font>

256
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-5!</font>

258
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smokey!</font>

259
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There're children in this laboratory that were kidnapped two years ago!</font>

260
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to take them back and then head for door R-66!</font>

261
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If what he said is true then there's a port straight ahead from there.</font>

262
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll steal a ship and escape from Punk Hazard!</font>

263
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Let's go!</font>

264
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's say goodbye to this island!</font>

265
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The children...</font>

266
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys, let's split up and find the children!</font>

267
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we can get every last one of them safely into the passageway! It's R-66!</font>

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, you're not allowed to be alone!</font>

269
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me, Momonosuke! I'm coming for you!</font>

270
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I understand.</font>

271
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks! Right then!</font>

272
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you wait, Caesar! You're not gonna stop me breathing again!</font>

273
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna batter you and take you hostage!</font>

274
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tashigi, I need you to lead those G-5 idiots now.</font>

275
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where're you going, Smoker-san?</font>

276
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not to face Vergo!?</font>

277
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't forgive that guy!</font>

278
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The law doesn't work in situations like this, Tashigi!</font>

279
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do it myself. He's underestimated the Navy!</font>

280
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, let me come too!</font>

281
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His... Vergo is insanely strong!</font>

282
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if something went wrong!?</font>

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's gonna protect our men? Help those idiots and the children escape.</font>

284
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san.</font>

285
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Seriously? Luffy already got beaten by Caesar?</font>

286
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we weren't prepared and we wound up suffocating, too.</font>

287
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard is a real pain! Since he's made outta gas he can suck the oxygen out of the air!</font>

288
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got knocked out by those yetis, too!</font>

289
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good.</font>

290
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

291
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good at all!</font>

292
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What were those two years for!?</font>

293
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, come on, we're both alive so-</font>

294
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't a joke!</font>

295
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we drop our guard beyond here there'll be no forgiveness!</font>

296
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!</font>

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro?</font>

298
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop messing around! From here on out this is the New World!</font>

299
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's pretty tough on himself.</font>

300
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, sorry! I won't drop my guard again!</font>

301
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Straw Hat!</font>

302
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno what he's doing, just take him out!</font>

303
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

304
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">UFO!</font>

305
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going ahead!</font>

306
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said be more serious!</font>

307
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get outta my way!</font>

308
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>
