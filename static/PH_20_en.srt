00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will be Caesar.</font>

136
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The button is located at-</font>

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say no more, Joker.</font>

138
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was my plan all along.</font>

139
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm right in front of the self destruct button.</font>

140
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The explosion will even reach the tanker they're planning to escape with.</font>

141
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of our ships will go to waste.  Is that alright?</font>

142
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me.</font>

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, take it all down with you, and die for me.</font>

144
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood...</font>

145
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">young master...</font>

146
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die, Smoker!</font>

147
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, partner.</font>

148
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've known you longer than any of the others.</font>

149
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've done well, until today.</font>

150
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you enjoy that? My Missile Girl's...</font>

151
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">flaming passion.</font>

152
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Baby 5!</font>

153
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you need this weapon when you're a weapon woman? </font>

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for picking it up for me, Buffalo.</font>

155
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That weapon is blessed.</font>

156
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whoever owns this weapon will become happy.</i></font>

157
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And if you buy it, I'll be happy too.</i></font>

158
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I am...</i></font>

159
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>needed!</i></font>

160
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you were being used!</font>

161
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out behind you -dasuyan!</font>

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know who sent you, but...</font>

163
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="36">I am the invincible Iron Pirate,
and I don't protect the peace of the seas!</font>

164
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="36">Iron Pirate!</font>

165
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's persistent!</font>

166
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapon Metamorphose!</font>

167
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Revolver Girl!</font>

168
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if that'd work!</font>

169
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is so fast! </font>

170
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is a dragon riding with us?</font>

171
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fath- </font>

172
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is with you?</font>

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

174
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The eel is attacking me!</font>

175
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Momo!</font>

176
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Farewell, young master. </font>

177
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the man...</font>

178
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who will become the Pirate King.</font>

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?</font>

180
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

181
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must have been an explosion somewhere, right?</font>

182
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was most likely Building D.</font>

183
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More specifically, it came from the SAD manufacturing room that I was in.</font>

184
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monet?</font>

185
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Monet?</font>

186
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Law.</font>

187
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart was supposed to be in Caesar's hands.</font>

188
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you have it?</font>

189
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'd gotten the wrong idea, that's all.</font>

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I want your heart! </i></font>

191
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And this seals our deal.</i></font>

192
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that, I took your heart, when you came to the laboratory.</font>

193
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The heart of Smoker.  Vice Admiral of Navy Unit G-5. </i></font>

194
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What a thoughtful present, Law. </i></font>

195
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just kindly returned the heart of his attendant Monet to him.</font>

196
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me.</font>

197
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As they all say, when you do something good,</font>

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">something good will happen to you.</font>

199
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good!</font>

200
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The place is starting to collapse even faster!</font>

201
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out!</font>

202
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The corridor is collapsing!</font>

203
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This tunnel is built in a mountainside.</font>

204
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it collapses, we'll be buried alive. </font>

205
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you talking about it so calmly!</font>

206
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

207
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rubble's blocking the path!</font>

208
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are the brakes? </font>

209
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!  We're safe now!</font>

210
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure wouldn't want him as an enemy!</font>

211
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he <i>is</i> our enemy. </font>

212
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There should be gas surrounding the exit as well.</font>

213
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can anyone here control the wind?</font>

214
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if you'd find someone with that special ability so easily!</font>

215
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can control it.</font>

216
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can!?</font>

217
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see the exit!</font>

218
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, just a bit further.</font>

219
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

220
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master! </font>

221
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The young master isn't here.</font>

222
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably in his room on the 4th floor.</font>

223
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, he wasn't in there.</font>

224
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the window was open.</font>

225
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh. Is that so?</font>

226
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I have no idea.</font>

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He left without taking any
 subordinates with him again.</font>

228
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-An iron security guard is in our way!</font>

229
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,040
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Sea</font>

230
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, the island and everyone on it haven't disappeared?</font>

231
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure you kill him.</font>

232
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm on my way!</font>

233
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,340
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Punk Hazard Shoreline</font>

234
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that iron soldier?</font>

235
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">None of our attacks do any damage.</font>

236
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because you tried to steal my cola.</font>

237
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cola?</font>

238
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he talking about?</font>

239
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring it on, Hurricane-man and Weapon-girl!</font>

240
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's wasting our time!</font>

241
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Baby 5.</font>

242
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one has ever been able to block this attack.</font>

243
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what you try, it's <i>super</i> useless!</font>

244
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna bore a hole in that body of yours!</font>

245
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This weapon that spins around is...</font>

246
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

247
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sickle Girl!</font>

248
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'll give you credit for that one.</font>

249
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impressive that you have the force to pierce through my General Body!</font>

250
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're basically like a mantis trying to fight a warship.</font>

251
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though it's wasted on you guys,</font>

252
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:49,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll show you the ultimate secret weapon 
of the pirate ship that will one day control these seas.</font>

253
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The land-based, mobile version of the Gaon Cannon!</font>

254
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its name is...</font>

255
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">General Cannon!</font>

256
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this -dasuyan!?</font>

257
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is this guy stopping us from getting Caesar back?!</font>

258
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that Caesar lying down there?</font>

259
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he doing here?</font>

260
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know who you're working for,</font>

261
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we can't afford to lose!</font>

262
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey hey, now this is a surprise.</font>

263
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys aren't your average pirates.</font>

264
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lump us in with that garbage!</font>

265
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the name of Joker...</font>

266
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'll be taking Caesar, by any means necessary. </font>

267
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I see!  So your goal...</font>

268
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is Caesar, huh?! </font>

269
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're almost at the exit!</font>

270
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep on blowing that wind, Nami!</font>

271
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The outside is flooded with poison gas too!</font>

272
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We made it out!</font>

273
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys finally made it.</font>

274
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was tired of waiting.</font>

275
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that!</font>

276
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Shogun!</font>

277
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Super!</i></font>

278
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a robot!</font>

279
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How amazingly cool!</font>

280
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buffalo?  And you're Baby 5!</font>

281
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law?!</font>

282
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really going against Joker?</font>

283
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You traitor!</font>

284
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker was saving the Seat of Hearts for you!</font>

285
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're they?</font>

286
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they your friends?</font>

287
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

288
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're enemies!</font>

289
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entire Straw Hat Crew and the Navy's G-5 unit!</font>

290
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't defeat them all.</font>

291
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is going on, Baby 5?</font>

292
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, we need to take Caesar to the young master.</font>

293
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just took Caesar and ran away.</font>

294
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, leave it to me! </font>

295
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flying enemies are the sniper's job.</font>

296
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys!</font>

297
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey.</font>

298
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp said to leave it to him.</font>

299
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't underestimate our sniper just because his nose is long. </font>

300
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be an idiot.</font>

301
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they somehow got away, the plan would...</font>

302
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You made an alliance with us, right?</font>

303
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weren't you watching just now?
I wish you'd put a bit more faith in us.</font>

304
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What alliance?</font>

305
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I've been doing is running.</font>

306
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to start attacking.</font>

307
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not afraid of an enemy that's far away and has lost the will to fight.</font>

308
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Furthermore, if the enemy's injured and has their back turned, I can handle him!</font>

309
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hurry up and get it done.</font>

310
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'm gonna give you some water.</font>

311
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do this.</font>

312
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grow Up!</font>

313
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Kabuto Chomping Grass!</font>

314
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, eat and store some ammo.</font>

315
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful, Buffalo.</font>

316
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're going to attack.</font>

317
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch my back, Baby 5.</font>

318
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who can fly.</font>

319
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll definitely complete our mission.</font>

320
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

321
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need me, right?</font>

322
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stop the attack, even if it costs me my life!</font>

323
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

324
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weather Egg!</font>

325
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's flying at us!</font>

326
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now hatch from your egg, lightning-chan!</font>

327
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thunder clouds?</font>

328
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buffalo, I've got a bad feeling about this!</font>

329
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm already flying at full speed!</font>

330
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not getting away.</font>

331
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's weather science! </font>

332
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thunder Breed...</font>

333
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

334
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tempo!</font>

335
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Baby 5!</font>

336
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, she's unconscious.</font>

337
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here's the finisher.</font>

338
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, chomping grass.</font>

339
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly...</font>

340
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shooting Star Rush!</font>

341
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Buffalo!  Protect me!</font>

342
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't move!</font>

343
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Of course.  Who do you think I am?</font>

344
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am part of the Donquixote Family!</font>

345
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will fulfill my...</font>

346
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a useless idiot.</font>

347
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think that'll work, you fool?</font>

348
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm made of gas!</font>

349
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I have to get to Dressrosa, even if it means going there alone!</font>

350
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's futile.</font>

351
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The last bullet was...</font>

352
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this? </font>

353
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...a pair of Sea Stone handcuffs!</font>

354
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!  I caught him!</font>

355
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that, Caesar!</font>

356
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can leave any enemy who's facing away to-</font>

357
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We get it already.</font>

358
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we've carried out phase one of the plan.</font>

359
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about it?</font>

360
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're pretty good aren't they?</font>

361
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I overslept.</font>

362
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, which way to Punk Hazard?</font>
