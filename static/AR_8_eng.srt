00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That'll be enough!</font>

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There isn't a fountain over there.</font>

132
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Could it be that rubber man?!</font>

133
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't worry about that.</font>

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's nothing, you damn half-fish!</font>

135
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I warned you not to 
say those words ever again,</font>

136
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">dead man!</font>

137
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If I can smash that block with a kick,</font>

138
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">he can fight.</font>

139
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy, you're the only one who can settle this now!</font>

140
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Those with devil fruit powers struggle to use those powers in the sea,</font>

141
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">let alone fight to survive, so he should be dead by now.</font>

142
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If he's still alive,</font>

143
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">that means someone is interfering with our little game.</font>

144
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you all right?!</font>

145
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm glad you're okay!</font>

146
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah! Oh?</font>

147
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?! What's the matter?!</font>

148
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Pops, what did you do 
with your pinwheel?</font>

149
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It was so cool.</font>

150
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who cares about that right now?!</font>

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Interfering?</font>

152
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It didn't seem like a fair game
from the start.</font>

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">At any rate,</font>

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">if something's getting in the way, 
I need to check on it.</font>

155
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Out of my way.</font>

156
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Egg Star!</font>

157
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I've got your back, Zoro!</font>

158
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Usopp!</font>

159
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is he all right?!</font>

160
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How brave! What an epic arrival!</font>

161
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go for broke!</font>

162
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's where you are?!</font>

163
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Usopp!</font>

164
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Listen, Nami!</font>

165
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I beat one of the officers!</font>

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">One of the officers! Me! I beat him!</font>

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The guy with a face like this.</font>

168
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Fishmen are a piece of cake!</font>

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You defeated... Chew?!</font>

170
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Serves you right!</font>

171
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">With my arrival, the fight suddenly reaches its climax!</font>

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The final chapter begins!</font>

173
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, is there anything you can do to get out of this?</font>

174
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, that's impossible.</font>

175
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't have any energy at all.</font>

176
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Come out! Come out! Come out!</font>

177
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Cook!</font>

178
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't know what's 
going on in the water,</font>

179
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but he must be the key!</font>

180
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Zoro!</font>

181
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stand firm and stop Arlong!</font>

182
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Okay!</font>

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We have to somehow prevent Arlong 
from going into the sea, huh?</font>

184
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll stop him from moving.</font>

185
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I won't let you have your way!</font>

186
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Arlong! Look here!</font>

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wha?! Big Bro Usopp!</font>

188
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How brave!</font>

189
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Usopp!</font>

190
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Standing in my way</font>

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Rubber Band of Doom!</font>

192
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">leads me to believe you want to die first, Roronoa Zoro.</font>

193
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now! Go, Zoro!</font>

194
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What are you trying to do?!</font>

195
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No way will I die.</font>

196
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll break that nose you're so proud of!</font>

197
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You fool.</font>

198
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm proud of it because it's unbreakable.</font>

199
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you were at your full strength,</font>

200
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">you might've been able to scratch it.</font>

201
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro!</font>

202
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Look over there!</font>

203
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hm?</font>

204
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Ahh! That damn octopus is up!</font>

205
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And... what the hell's he doing?</font>

206
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dammit! I thought the rubber band
was going to hit me!</font>

207
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

208
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">See?! He was my target!</font>

209
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You yelled, "Arlong," didn't you?</font>

210
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The octopus.</font>

211
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Roronoa Zoro! I won't 
let you have your way!</font>

212
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll crush your friend 
who went into the sea!</font>

213
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You don't have to be concerned 
since you'll all be dead, after all.</font>

214
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro!</font>

215
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami's big sister!</font>

216
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave the rest to me!</font>

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A fishman!</font>

218
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Move away, Big Sister.</font>

219
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll break that rock with my kick!</font>

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That octopus!</font>

221
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Takoyaki Punch!</font>

222
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Sister!</font>

223
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro!</font>

224
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So that was it?</font>

225
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That was too quick.</font>

226
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's up with these bandages?</font>

227
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did you fall down or something?</font>

228
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's this scar?</font>

229
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How can he still be alive 
with wounds like this?</font>

230
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How can he still be standing?!</font>

231
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What is that look in his eyes?</font>

232
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is that the look of someone who's dying?</font>

233
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's a man I need to kill for sure,</font>

234
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">right here, right now!</font>

235
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Staying still...</font>

236
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">would have kept some of the wounds from opening.</font>

237
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's right.</font>

238
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You find your situation amusing?</font>

239
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm not talking about me.</font>

240
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm talking about the octofreak.</font>

241
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

242
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I thought I told you,</font>

243
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">we win this game.</font>

244
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dammit!</font>

245
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That scared the crap outta me!</font>

246
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're the one who complicated everything in the first place!</font>

247
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He did it!</font>

248
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go beat down that shark bastard,</font>

249
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">you damn idiot!</font>

250
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is it coming, kid?</font>

251
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's coming!</font>

252
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wahhhhh! I'm back!</font>

253
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Rubber boy!</font>

254
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Luffy!</font>

255
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy!</font>

256
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That damn rubber jerk!</font>

257
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're late, idiot!</font>

258
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro!</font>

259
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh?</font>

260
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! Stop it!</font>

261
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You wouldn't!</font>

262
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's my turn!</font>

263
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You idiot!</font>

264
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,660

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bell...</font>

266
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and...</font>

267
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Whip!</font>

268
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

269
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Pistol!</font>

270
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gatling!</font>

271
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">All right!</font>

272
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did you do something?</font>

273
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He didn't feel a thing!</font>

274
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yep. That was my warm-up.</font>

275
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That idiot!</font>

276
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm gonna kill him!</font>

277
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's admirable how you scum have held on by the skin of your teeth.</font>

278
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Though, you'd have been happier dying at the bottom of the sea.</font>

279
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hm? Not really.</font>

280
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm glad they saved me.</font>

281
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Can you understand my anger?</font>

282
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's the anger of seeing my dear 
brothers crushed by worms.</font>

283
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You'll soon wish that you 
had submitted to your deaths.</font>

284
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is Big Bro Luffy gonna be okay?</font>

285
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">His furious assault had no effect whatsoever.</font>

286
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">More importantly, how far did Big Bro Zoro fly?!</font>

287
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go Luffy! I've got your back!</font>

288
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You don't have to worry 
about his back.</font>

289
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If he loses, you guys will all die, too.</font>

290
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah, we will.</font>

291
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If that happens, it's the end for the East Blue, as well.</font>

292
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's the bleak difference between you and me?</font>

293
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our noses.</font>

294
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our jaws?</font>

295
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I wonder if Big Bro's joking.</font>

296
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No, he's definitely serious.</font>

297
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our webs!</font>

298
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's our race!</font>

299
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Such a fool! He hurt himself 
by biting on a rock!</font>

300
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now his teeth are crack–</font>

301
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He crushed the stone 
pillar with his teeth!</font>

302
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Ahh! That's scary!</font>

303
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did you see...</font>

304
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">the inherent power of a fishman?</font>

305
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Heaven created you humans to have you bow before fishmen.</font>

306
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're inferior creatures.</font>

307
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're on a different level 
from the moment we're born.</font>

308
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll show you the real difference between you and me.</font>

309
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, yeah? Let's see it.</font>

310
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's no way I'm losing to you.</font>

311
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I am the man who'll be 
king of the pirates!</font>

312
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">King of the pirates?</font>

313
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't make me laugh.</font>

314
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Can you inferior humans do something like...</font>

315
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">crush a pillar with your teeth?</font>

316
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If that jaw gets you,</font>

317
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">it won't just leave bite marks...</font>

318
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">it'll tear clear through your bones!</font>

319
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So what?!</font>

320
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop...</font>

321
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">bragging over stuff like that!</font>

322
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can break stone without biting it.</font>

323
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nice! Score one for Big Bro Luffy!</font>

324
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's right! 
The result's the same!</font>

325
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Th-That's beside the point!</font>

326
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Humans are stupid and weak.</font>

327
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you fall into water and can't pull yourself out,</font>

328
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">then what'll you do?!</font>

329
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nothing! That's why I need help!</font>

330
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hm? He can also use swords?</font>

331
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take that... and that... and that!</font>

332
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What're you doing?</font>

333
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It looks like you're just 
swinging those blades around.</font>

334
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm not looking to play your little game.</font>

335
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I've had enough of this nonsense.</font>

336
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Clench your teeth!</font>

337
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wha...?! He shattered Arlong's teeth!</font>

338
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't know how to use swords, you bastard!</font>

339
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? What's he saying that now for?</font>

340
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't know how to sail.</font>

341
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't cook.</font>

342
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't lie, either.</font>

343
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey!</font>

344
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm confident that I can't 
live without help!</font>

345
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Fully admitting how 
pathetic you are...</font>

346
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You sure are honest.</font>

347
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I bet your crew is 
bothered by having</font>

348
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">such an incompetent captain like you.</font>

349
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I wonder why your crew tried 
so desperately to save you.</font>

350
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How can someone like you, with no damn pride, be a pirate captain?</font>

351
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What in the world can you do?</font>

352
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can defeat you!</font>
