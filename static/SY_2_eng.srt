47
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We can't simply kill her.</font>

48

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So basically, on your signal, the men
and I storm the village and kill the girl.</font>

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Then you'll get her inheritance.</font>

52
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Imbecile! Use your head!</font>

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How could I, an outsider,
inherit Kaya's estate?!</font>

54
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">By working hard for it?</font>

55
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Working hard is futile.</font>

56
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Listen, this is the most
important part!</font>

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Before killing her, you'll use hypnosis
to make Kaya write her will to say...</font>

58
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">"I leave my entire fortune
to my butler, Klahadore!"</font>

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Only then will I inherit
her enormous fortune...</font>

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">in a completely legitimate manner.</font>

61
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I've spent three long years gaining
the trust of everyone around her,</font>

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so no one would bat an eye when
she leaves me her inheritance.</font>

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Three years as a butler for that, huh?</font>

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You sure scared us back then,</font>

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Captain Kuro.</font>

66
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Three years ago, you suddenly said
you were giving up life as a pirate.</font>

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just like that, you set up
a subordinate as your double...</font>

68
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and let "Captain Kuro" be
executed for the world to see.</font>

69
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So that was the beginning of this plan.</font>

70
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You truly are Kuro
of a Thousand Plans.</font>

71
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't call me that.</font>

72
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I abandoned that name
three years ago.</font>

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">All I want now is to obtain vast riches
free from government pursuit.</font>

74
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In other words, I'm a pacifist now.</font>

75
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A "pacifist," he says!</font>

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What kind of pacifist murders
a rich girl's entire family?</font>

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hold on, now.</font>

78
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The father's death was real.</font>

79
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I hadn't planned on that.</font>

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh well.</font>

81
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It doesn't matter.</font>

82
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just give us the signal already.</font>

83
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We've been waiting offshore
for almost a whole week now.</font>

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The men are starting to get antsy.</font>

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This isn't good!</font>

86
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,090

88

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Weren't you listening?!
This is <i>seriously</i> bad!</font>

89
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're the real deal!</font>

90
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Captain Kuro is known as the most
cunning and ruthless pirate of all!</font>

91
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'd heard the Marines caught
and executed him three years ago...</font>

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but Captain Kuro is alive...</font>

93
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">as Klahadore, the butler!</font>

94
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's been after Kaya's fortune
for the past three years!</font>

95
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're gonna attack the village!</font>

96

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kaya's in danger, too!</font>

97
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is bad!</font>

98
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,890

101

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, wake up, Jango!</font>

125
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Have you still not fixed that habit?!</font>

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Hey, what're you doing?!
You're gonna fall!</font>

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Man, head-first, huh?</font>

128
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I didn't mean to kill him,</font>

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but there's no way
he survived that fall...</font>

130
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit!</font>

131
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He killed him!</font>

132
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That bastard!</font>

133
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit!</font>

134
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What about the other one?</font>

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Shall I take care of him?</font>

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No need.</font>

137
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Whatever he does
won't make a difference.</font>

138
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Tomorrow morning, Jango.</font>

139
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Attack the village at daybreak.</font>

140
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Ransack the villagers' homes,</font>

141
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and make certain Miss Kaya's
murder looks like an accident!</font>

142
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Tomorrow!</font>

143
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's how it is, Usopp.</font>

144
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No matter what you heard,
you can't stop my plan.</font>

145
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit!</font>

146
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You sure about him?</font>

147
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Of course. My plans are flawless.</font>

148
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is bad! This is really, <i>really</i> bad!</font>

149
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Everyone I grew up with
is going to be killed!</font>

150
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kaya is going to be killed!</font>

151
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Everyone I love!</font>

152

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Who are you?!</i></font>

153
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>The name's Usopp!</i></font>

154
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I'm a brave warrior of the sea!</i></font>

155
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,170

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I'll cheer you up with a story!</i></font>

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Mind your own business!</i></font>

158
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Please leave!</i></font>

159
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I'll call for someone!</i></font>

160
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>And then? What happened after that?!</i></font>

161
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I fought, of course!</i></font>

162
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit!</font>

163
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

164
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh? Wasn't Luffy with him?</font>

165
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

166
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Where's Luffy? Didn't you
go to the shore toge...</font>

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is he still mad about
his dad being insulted?</font>

168
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Who knows?</font>

169
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, that look was different!</font>

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, something must've happened!</font>

171
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What could've freaked
him out like that?</font>

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, how do we get to that shore?</font>

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Doesn't this smell like trouble?!</font>

174
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah! Something
went down at the shore!</font>

175
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is a job for the Usopp Pirates!</font>

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright, already!
How do we get there?!</font>

177
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Terrible news, everyone!</font>

178
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The pirates are coming!</font>

179
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Pirates are going to raid
this village tomorrow morning!</font>

180
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Run away, everyone!</font>

181
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright, Usopp!</font>

182
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Enough is enough!</font>

183
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We'll shut you up for good!</font>

184
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">N-No, it's not like that!</font>

185
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's the truth this time!</font>

186
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Shut up! All you ever do
is spout huge lies!</font>

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you were as honest as Klahadore,
maybe we'd actually believe you!</font>

188
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i><font color="#ffffff"><font color="#ffffff">Whatever he does

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Attack the village at daybreak.</i></font>

191
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit!</font>

192
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So he let me go... because
he knew no one would believe me?!</font>

193
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Are these to your liking?</font>

194
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I picked up the glasses
you custom-ordered...</font>

195
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">from the next town over.</font>

196
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes, they're perfect!</font>

197
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm sorry for asking you
to go all the way there.</font>

198
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's a present, isn't it?</font>

199
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes.</font>

200
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Tomorrow will be three years since
Klahadore came to this mansion.</font>

201
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's always taken
good care of me, so...</font>

202
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Klahadore will be delighted!</font>

203
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He will!</font>

205
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Pirates really will attack
tomorrow morning!</font>

206
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If we believed every one of your tall tales,
we'd have fled hundreds of times by now!</font>

207
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Please believe me!
You gotta get out of here!</font>

208
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They really <i>are</i> going to kill everyone!</font>

209
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I swear it's the truth this time!</font>

210
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And <i>we're</i> gonna get <i>you</i> this time!</font>

213
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Thank you for coming, men.</font>

214
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's truly been a long three years.</font>

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Once this plan succeeds,</font>

216
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I intend to give you all
a fair share of the plunder.</font>

217
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">At dawn tomorrow, ransack the village
to your hearts' content!</font>

218

221
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's what they said.
No doubt about it.</font>

222
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So what were you doing
sleeping down here?</font>

223
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's the thing!</font>

224
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I thought I was on top of the cliff...</font>

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82" color="#d6d6d6">So how'd I get down here?</font>

226
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We were right! Klahadore's a bad guy!</font>

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No wonder he seems so creepy!</font>

228
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So that's why our captain ran to
the village with that intense look!</font>

229
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's great, then!</font>

230
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They have time to escape now
that they've been warned.</font>

231
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Talk about dumb bad guys!</font>

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, that's right!
We gotta run away, too!</font>

233
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, we better grab our valuables...</font>

234
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– ...and hurry!
– ...and hurry!</font>

235
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh no!</font>

236
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?</font>

237
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We need to stock up on food
before the meat shop guy runs away!</font>

238
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's not the problem here.</font>

239
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp!</font>

240
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Thank goodness!</font>

241
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I thought you might
never come back...</font>

242
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You gotta run, Kaya!</font>

243
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're gonna kill you!</font>

244
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Um...</font>

245
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What do you mean?</font>

246
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've been tricked!</font>

247
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Your butler is actually a pirate!</font>

248
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hold on...</font>

249
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What kind of joke is this?</font>

250
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's no joke!</font>

251
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I heard it with my own ears!</font>

252
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Klahadore's a pirate...</font>

253
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">who weaseled his way into
this mansion to steal your fortune!</font>

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's been pretending to be a butler for
three whole years just so he could rob you!</font>

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you talking about, Usopp?</font>

256
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He said his crew's gonna storm in
and kill you at dawn tomorrow!</font>

257
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This guy's as bad as they come!
You gotta escape, quick!</font>

258
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I admit, he did go too far earlier.</font>

259
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But lying like this...</font>

260
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's not like you, Usopp!</font>

261
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No, it's not a lie...</font>

262
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's the truth...</font>

263
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's the truth!</font>

264
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>So...</i></font>

265
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>tell me, Usopp...</i></font>

266
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>What kind of story
do you have today?</i></font>

267
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Hmm...</i></font>

268
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Let's see... Today...</i></font>

269
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Yes?</i></font>

270
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Alright!</i></font>

271
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>This story happened when I was five...</i></font>

272
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I fought a giant goldfish
that lived in the south seas.</i></font>

273
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>A goldfish?</i></font>

274
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>You fought a goldfish?</i></font>

275
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Yeah! It was so big,
not even a fish tank...</i></font>

276
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>the size of this mansion
could've held it!</i></font>

277
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Oh, my!</i></font>

278
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I...</font>

279
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I loved them.</font>

280
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I loved the lies you told...</font>

281
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yet, why are you saying this?</font>

282
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's not like that! I'm not trying
to get back at Klahadore...</font>

283
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So why say it...?</font>

284
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kaya... I...</font>

285
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is something the matter, Miss?!</font>

286
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You gotta escape, Kaya!</font>

287
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Unhand her this instant!</font>

288
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just trust me!</font>

289
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You gotta get out of this village...</font>

290
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">before that butler gets back!</font>

291
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Stop!</font>

292
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Come on!</font>

293
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This will all make sense tomorrow!</font>

294
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But you gotta escape for now!</font>

295
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Please, listen to me!</font>

296
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're pathetic.</font>

297
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get away from her!</font>

298
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No!</font>

299
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Please, catch him!</font>

300
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He roughed up the lady of the house!</font>

301
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How horrible!</font>

302
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How could he?!</font>

303
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why...</font>

304
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why won't anyone believe me?</font>

305
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There he is!</font>

306
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Get him!</font>

307
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp...</font>

308
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Please maintain
your composure, miss!</font>

309
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Tomorrow morning, Jango.</i></font>

310
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Attack the village at daybreak!</i></font>

311
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

312
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, guys!</font>

313
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey!</font>

314
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Y-You're alive?!</font>

315
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alive?</font>

316
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, I just woke up!</font>

317
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He was asleep this whole time!</font>

318
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Anyway, Captain!</font>

319
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We heard everything!</font>

320
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let's hurry and tell everyone
about the pirates!</font>

321
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Tell everyone?</font>

322
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>You're pathetic.</i></font>

323
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Shut up! All you ever do
is spout huge lies!</i></font>

324
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm lying as usual, obviously!</font>

325
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That damn butler pissed me off,</font>

326
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so I made up a lie about
him being a pirate!</font>

327
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, I see!</font>

328
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So the straw hat guy is in on it, too!</font>

329
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, what's wrong?</font>

330
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I...</font>

331
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I can't believe you'd do that, Captain.</font>

332
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Me neither!</font>

333
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Same here!</font>

334
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even if that butler <i>is</i> a jerk,</font>

335
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I never thought you would lie
just to hurt someone!</font>

336
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We really respected you, too!</font>

337
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let's go home!</font>

338
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, it's suppertime!</font>

339
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wonder what we're having...</font>

340
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why did you tell them that?</font>

341
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Because I'm a liar.</font>

342
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They were never going to
believe me from the start.</font>

343
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I was too optimistic.</font>

344
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even so, the truth is the truth.</font>

345
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Pirates really are going
to come, aren't they?</font>

346
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, they're definitely
gonna show up.</font>

347
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But everyone thinks it's a lie.</font>

348
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They think tomorrow will be
just another normal, peaceful day...</font>

349
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's why...</font>

350
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm gonna stop the pirates at the beach
tomorrow and make sure it stays a lie!</font>

351
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's the only thing that
makes sense for a liar like me!</font>

352
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even if I get shot in the arm...</font>

353
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">or driven off with brooms...</font>

354
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">this is my home!</font>

355
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I love this village!</font>

356
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I want to protect everyone!</font>

357
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're one hell of a good guy,</font>

358
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">pushing away your crew
and going into battle alone.</font>

359
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just so you know, I call dibs
on all the pirates' treasure!</font>

360
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright! We'll help you out!</font>

361
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You guys...</font>

362
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">are going to fight with me?!</font>

363
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why?</font>

364
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well, you're way outnumbered, right?</font>

365
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">"Scared" is written all over your face.</font>

366
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">M-Me, scared?!</font>

367
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm perfectly fine against
lots of bad guys or whatever!</font>

368
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:30,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">After all, I'm Captain Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea!</font>

369
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Dammit! Dammit!</font>

370
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What're you looking at?!</font>

371
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We're dealing with Klahadore's crew!</font>

372
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Of course I'm scared!</font>

373
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's wrong with that?!</font>

374
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I don't want your pity!</font>

375
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Stop laughing and leave! Leave!</font>

376
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We aren't laughing!</font>

377
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's commendable.
That's why we want to help you.</font>

378
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">As if we'd risk our lives out of pity!</font>

379
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh...</font>

380
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You guys...</font>
