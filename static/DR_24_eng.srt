132
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can live the rest of our lives in luxury!</font>

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">F...</font>

134
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is bad, Usoland's...</font>

135
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five stars!</font>

136
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are some one-stars and a three-star guy there as well. </font>

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sabo-kun, what should we do?</font>

138
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're escaping above ground.</font>

139
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, hurry!</font>

140
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">God Usopp! Sorry, but please die!</font>

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five stars is 500 million!</font>

142
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Those guys were worshiping me a minute ago!</font>

143
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, run away.</font>

144
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

145
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's one over there.</font>

146
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the one-star samurai.</font>

147
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A hundred million belly!</font>

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How troublesome.</font>

149
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-According to the dwarves, this is the scrapyard.</font>

150
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really down here, Kanjuurou?</font>

151
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The 100 million is mine!</font>

152
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">To hell with it!</font>

153
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He fell!</font>

154
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The samurai fell into the hole!</font>

155
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have time to hesitate.</font>

156
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time is ticking,
 people are dying, and the town is burning. </font>

157
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do?</font>

158
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've only just realized that King Riku was innocent...</font>

159
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If all of us were to go up against him, then maybe we could kill Doflamingo.</font>

160
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not alone though.</font>

161
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To defeat Doflamingo, we'd have to go through two thousand members of the Donquixote Family.</font>

162
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what are we supposed to do?</font>

163
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku is among those twelve.</font>

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We shouldn't have to kill them.</font>

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Restraining them will do. There's only twelve of them.</font>

166
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no choice.</font>

167
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to fight.</font>

168
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd Cyborg Franky disappear to?</font>

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Barrier!</font>

170
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't follow us.</font>

171
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep going toward the surface!</font>

172
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro?</font>

173
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

174
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?</font>

175
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that Robin?</font>

176
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm with Luffy and the others right now.</font>

177
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's called the "Royal Grounds".</font>

178
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been put in a really aggravating situation.</font>

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin? Did you see that?</font>

180
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mingo's really annoying.</font>

181
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Usopp's bit was hilarious.</font>

182
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell, Luffy!</font>

183
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca was on that list as well, do you think she's okay?</font>

184
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca's...</font>

185
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm right here, Lucy.</font>

186
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, perfect timing.</font>

187
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldier's right here...</font>

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd the soldier go?</font>

189
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me, he...</font>

190
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an outlaw, kill him!</font>

191
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Soldier-san...</font>

192
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Soldier-san turn back into a human?</font>

193
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy, what kind of person is he?</font>

194
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of person?</font>

195
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one-legged soldier is...</font>

197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">your dad!</font>

198
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the guy from the statue in the Colosseum!</font>

199
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I-I couldn't protect her. </i></font>

200
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it...</font>

201
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Soldier-san is valiant...</i></font>

202
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>... and he will always watch over you.</i></font>

203
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm happy for you.</font>

204
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldier guy went somewhere, but listen, Rebecca.</font>

205
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't cry yet.</font>

206
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let the soldier die.</font>

207
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure you stay safe.</font>

208
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:18,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry I couldn't give you the Flame Fruit that you wanted to eat.</font>

209
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in exchange, I'll beat the crap out of Doflamingo!</font>

210
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So stay with my crewmates.</font>

211
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll end this game right away.</font>

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay alive!</font>

213
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it?!</font>

214
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

215
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, tell me who's there on your end.</font>

216
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here we have...</font>

217
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand, Straw Hatter?</font>

218
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our plan was to destroy the Smile factory to make Doflamingo and Kaidou clash.</font>

219
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you take out Doflamingo now, Kaidou's rage at losing the Smiles will be directed at us.</font>

220
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll mean we have to fight an enraged Emperor!</font>

221
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can worry about that later.</font>

222
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just look at this country! I've gotta do something!</font>

223
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Find the outlaws!</font>

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we want to survive, we have to catch them!</font>

225
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you find any outlaws, let everyone know right away!</font>

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, please stop me!</font>

227
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close. Don't let your guard down.</font>

228
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get moving.</font>

229
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isshou-san, you're not going to capture Doflamingo?</font>

230
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to restrain as many of the people running rampant as possible.</font>

231
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, our target here is the alliance between Straw Hat and Law.</font>

232
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Contact all our squadrons.</font>

233
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, I'm still in handcuffs.</font>

234
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll come off soon enough.</font>

235
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

236
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get the key.</font>

237
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promise I'll find it, and-</font><font size="13"></font>

238
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What route are we taking?</font>

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straight ahead!</font>

240
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not planning to jump, is he?!</font>

241
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you wait, Doflamingo!</font>

242
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Droves of people are pouring out from under the Colosseum!</font>

243
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like all the upheaval caused the underground and the surface to merge!</font>

244
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These must be the people who were forced to work in that underground port!</font>

245
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldiers...</font>

246
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Officials...</font>

247
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates!</font>

248
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... I can't believe so many people were enslaved without anyone knowing!</font>

249
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maynard, who told you to infiltrate the battle tournament?</font>

250
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go off on your own like that.</font>

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're lucky you're still alive.</font>

252
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Bastille-san,</font>

253
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">doing so let me see the whole picture of the tournament.</font>

254
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we apprehend Doflamingo,</font>

255
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,450
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Navy HQ Vice-Admiral
Maynard the Pursuer (Participant in the tournament)</font>

256
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the balance of the world could shift!</font>

Trading Port</font>

258
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

259
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a trading vessel from the Kingdom of Biggschots, disguised as a pirate ship.</font>

260
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows from several countries have come together in this port.</font>

261
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop!</font>

262
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm so sorry!</font>

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, Isshou-san?!</font>

266
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo can't be allowed to be a Warlord any longer!</font>

267
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should capture him right now!</font>

268
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure the Navy has been doing the same thing all along.</font>

269
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been in this organization a long time, right, Vice-Admiral?</font>

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you always ignored...</font>

271
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">these enraged screams?</font>

272
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not crying. They're furious!</font>

273
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think the World Government...</font>

274
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are gods?!</font>

275
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will obey my decision.</font>

276
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law and the others are after the Smiles, right?</font>

277
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Doffy, shouldn't we protect the factory?</font>

278
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,420
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Land Where The Royal Palace Is (The Sunflower Field)</font>

280
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I've got the keys right here.</font>

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600

282
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure?!</font>

283
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why give the enemy hope?</font>

284
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How weak you are. 
 You couldn't even protect one little girl,</font>

285
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trebol.</font>

286
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, old G-zer! She's not really a little girl, you know!</font>

287
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, Doffy!</font>

288
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really sorry about Sugar.</font>

289
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could I have known that a man with both arms and legs tied could make her faint?</font>

290
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was inconceivable!</font>

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the same with the Flame Fruit.</font>

292
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had no idea that the Revolutionary Army's second-in-command was fighting in the tournament.</font>

293
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was inconceivable!</font>

294
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No excuses, you disgraceful fools!</font>

295
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G, for dis<u>G</u>raceful!</font>

296
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's in the past.</font>

297
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blaming you won't change anything.</font>

298
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right? Our boss is the best!</font>

299
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that, Lao G!</font>

300
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you insist, I will accept your forgiveness.</font>

301
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Doffy, now the Navy will give us trouble.</font>

302
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do about Fujitora?</font>

303
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've settled matters with him. The Navy won't go after us.</font>

304
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But once Fujitora's use runs out,</font>

305
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'll have to get rid of him.</font>

306
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>To completely eliminate the system of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.</i></font>

307
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,700

308
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, getting rid of him won't be easy.</font>

309
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy and the pirates...</font>

310
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You could just let me go all out...</font>

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice!</font>

312
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so...</font>

313
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... and I could wipe them all out on my own!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have asked the populace if the Rikus or the Donquixotes are more fit to rule the country.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The citizens will choose their king.
They have that right.</font>

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,860

340
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never allow anyone to laugh at my family.
Do you understand?</font>

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,460

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I can't believe that pervert had the strength to run away.</font>

363
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd be in trouble no matter where we landed.</font>

364
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This entire country is our enemy.</font>

365
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's run!</font>

366
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

367
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After them!</font>

368
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, not that way!</font>

369
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the right way either, Straw Hat!</font>

370
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,290

373
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, Vise!</font>

374
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,570

 Should we really cut them down?</font>

389
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are civilians in there!</font>

390
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'll use my Haki to...</font>

391
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease this.</font>

396
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is! After him!</font>

397
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get him!</font>

398
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just leave me alone already!</font>

399
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this altered geography, the Colosseum wall is pushed up against the royal grounds.</font>

400
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can climb up there to meet with the others.</font>

401
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found them!</font>

402
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca, go on ahead.</font>

403
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-san!</font>

404
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're mine!</font>

405
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartolomeo!</font>

406
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so honored to have you address me by name, Robin-senpai!</font>

407
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'll stop the enemies here.</font>

408
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go on ahead with Sogeking-senpai.</font>

409
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

410
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-senpai thanked me!</font>

411
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I'm really fired up!
I ain't letting anyone chase you any further!</font>

412
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he planning to do now?</font>

413
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's happening again!</font>

414
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It can't be...</font>

415
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's finally...</font>

417
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once that guy shows up, it's all over!</font>

418
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can fight him!</font>

419
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is that?!</font>

420
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A giant...</font>

421
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's way too big!</font>

422
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

423
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pica!</font>

424
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pica-sama!</font>

425
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, everyone who dares to oppose our family...</font>

426
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will take you on!</font>

427
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice! It's so high!</font>

428
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, come on!</font>

429
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't fit him at all!</font>

430
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a weird voice!</font>

431
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>
