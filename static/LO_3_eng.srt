00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Since the day you sent me flying,</font>

127
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've been obsessed with
getting revenge on you.</font>

128
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That alone led me to
finally find my crew.</font>

129
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was indeed a great adventure.
I was missing parts of my body.</font>

130
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I laughed, I went through hell,
and I made new friends.</font>

131
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I call it "Little Buggy's Big Adventure."</font>

132
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You see, Buggy was...</font>

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why am I telling <i>you</i> any of this?!</font>

134
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What? Wait, what
was your name again?</font>

135
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bogey... No, Boogie.
Maybe it was Behee...? Or not...</font>

136
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, yeah!</font>

137
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buffoon!</font>

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buffoon?! Stop messing around!</font>

139
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're as irritating as ever, you moron!</font>

140
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-That's Buggy the Clown!</font>

141
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They're p-pirates!</font>

142
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the Buggy Pirates!</font>

143
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">People! Remain flashily where you are!</font>

144
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna show you all
just how scary I am.</font>

145
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh! It's Buggy!</font>

146
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You just remembered it?!</font>

147
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What's going on?</font>

148
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Long time no see, rubber man.
How's Roronoa Zoro doing?</font>

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay, Cabaji. Good job.</font>

150
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I ask that my hundreds of billions of
followers around the world watch closely!</font>

151
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're about to host a super
flashy public execution!</font>

152
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Monkey D. Luffy! You can't
move even an inch now.</font>

153
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You should feel honored, Straw Hat!</font>

154
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You get to die in the same place
as the King of the Pirates.</font>

155
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The atmospheric pressure
is dropping like crazy.</font>

156
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've never seen such
a bizarre drop before.</font>

157
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now that you mention it,
the wind does feel different...</font>

158
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A storm is gonna hit this island!</font>

159
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A-A storm?</font>

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'd better hurry back to
the ship or we'll be in trouble.</font>

161
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Will it be a big one?</font>

162
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey...!</font>

163
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

164
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Zoro!</font>

165
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Have you seen him?</font>

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You mean Luffy?</font>

167
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Pirates are here!
– Pirates are here!</font>

168
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pirates are here!</font>

169
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Run!</font>

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's Buggy the Clown!</font>

171
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What'd they say?!</font>

172
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buggy the Clown!</font>

173
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What? Then...</font>

174
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yes, sir!</font>

175
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In addition to Straw Hat Luffy,
Buggy the Clown and Iron Club Alvida,</font>

176
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">both being notorious East Blue pirates,
have arrived to take over the square!</font>

177
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right under my nose...</font>

178
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What arrogant scum.</font>

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What should we do, Captain Smoker?</font>

180
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Unit one will set up on the sea!</font>

181
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Unit two will secretly surround
the square in the streets.</font>

182
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The rest will stand by within
firing range of the square.</font>

183
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That is all!</font>

184
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, sir!</font>

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Give this order to unit one.</font>

186
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes sir?</font>

187
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Destroy any pirate ships
as soon as you see them.</font>

188
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't let any pirates off
this island. Not a single one."</font>

189
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">An execution!</font>

190
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">An execution is starting!</font>

191
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buggy the Clown will be
executing Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

192
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy's gonna be executed?!</font>

193
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That idiot!</font>

194
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's go!</font>

195
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Take care of this!</font>

196
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">S-S-S-Sanji!</font>

197
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Treat it like a lady! Got it?!</font>

198
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oops!</font>

199
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We have to hurry, too!</font>

200
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Hey, N-N-Nami! Where're we going?!</font>

201
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The harbor, of course!</font>

202
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-The harbor? Oh, makes sense!</font>

203
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Smoker! Please take a look.</font>

204
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Things are getting weird.</font>

205
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

206
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wha...! Th-That kid...!</font>

207
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's he doing?</font>

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Monkey D. Luffy. This can't be!
It looks like he's about to be killed!</font>

209
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain, are we
swooping in right away?</font>

210
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Idiot. Don't be hasty.</font>

211
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A pirate is about to kill another pirate.</font>

212
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is great. They're
saving us the trouble.</font>

213
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Listen up! Once Straw Hat's head rolls,</font>

214
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">surround Buggy, Alvida,
and those with them!</font>

215
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't give 'em time to think!</font>

216
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:13,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pirate Monkey D. Luffy is a criminal
and will be flashily executed for...</font>

217
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">pissing me off with his attitude!</font>

218
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Live it up flashily!</font>

219
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is my first time
seeing an execution.</font>

220
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're executing <i>you</i>.</font>

221
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

222
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! Stop joking!</font>

223
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You</i> stop joking!</font>

224
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Take this board off! You bastard!</font>

225
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And now, the public execution
will flashily commence!</font>

226
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Take it off! You tricked me!
You're a jerk! You bastard!</font>

227
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Ahhh!! Stop it! Ahhh!
I don't wanna die!</font>

228
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's a big cumulus cloud
in the sky to the east!</font>

229
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A storm is coming. It's
gonna be unimaginably big...</font>

230
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If Buggy, Luffy, and the others
go crazy, the Marines will take action.</font>

231
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're done for if the ship is washed
out to sea when we have to escape.</font>

232
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, this is urgent!</font>

233
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Marines may have
already made their move.</font>

234
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The <i>Going Merry</i> is in danger!</font>

235
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-The <i>Going Merry</i>
will end up in Marine hands?</font>

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Come on, Nami! H-Hurry up!</font>

237
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,470

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Since you have a big audience,</font>

253
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">do you wanna say
something before you die?</font>

254
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No? Well, that's okay.</font>

255
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It wouldn't matter anyway
since you're about to die.</font>

256
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm the man who's gonna be
King of the Pirates!</font>

257
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wha...?</font>

258
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">D-Did he just say
"King of the Pirates"?!</font>

259
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In this town, of all places...</font>

260
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a crazy thing to say...</font>

261
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well then, I guess this is it...
you rubber twerp.</font>

262
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop...</font>

263
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What?</font>

264
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– ...the execution!
– ...the execution!</font>

265
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?</font>

266
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Zoro! Sanji!</font>

267
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's Pirate Hunter Z-Zoro!</font>

268
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Zoro?!</font>

269
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Ah, there you are, Zoro!
But you arrived a moment too late!</font>

270
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– We'll bring down...
– ...that execution platform!</font>

271
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Roronoa Zoro...</font>

272
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Guys... get them!</font>

273
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Leave it to us!</font>

274
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Big Sis Alvida!</font>

275
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Out of our way!</font>

276
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Not even Zoro can stop me now!</font>

277
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is the end of your captain!</font>

278
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn bastard!</font>

279
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If I could just cut down the platform...</font>

280
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Listen.</font>

281
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The instant Monkey D. Luffy's head falls,
we're to attack all at once!</font>

282
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All units. Prepare for battle.</font>

283
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!</font>

284
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Zoro! Sanji!</i></font>

285
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Hurry up!</font>

286
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Usopp! Nami!</i></font>

287
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">This is heavy!</font>

288
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sorry.</font>

289
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm... dead.</font>

290
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I'm... dead.</i></font>

291
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Idiot...!</font>

292
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't say something so stupid!</font>

293
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He smiled!</font>

294
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm still alive!</font>

295
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Neat!</font>

296
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hey, do you believe in God?</font>

297
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Phew, lucky me.</font>

298
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop talking nonsense.
Let's get out of this town already!</font>

299
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">I was worried for a moment.</font>

300
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's just one thing after another.</font>

301
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now! Corner the pirates!</font>

302
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yeah!
– Yeah!</font>

303
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here they come!</font>

304
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Amazing! Amazing!
It's suddenly gotten crazy!</font>

305
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Amazing! Ahh! Amazing!</font>

306
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Luffy!</font>

307
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Ahhh... Z-Zoro!</font>

308
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I get that this is exciting,
but we've gotta go!</font>

309
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'd better hurry back to the ship or
we'll never be able to leave the island.</font>

310
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We won't be able to
enter the Grand Line!</font>

311
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! That's not good!</font>

312
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Straw Hats are running!</font>

313
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Capture them!</font>

314
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go after them!</font>

315
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why did he smile?</font>

316
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Did he know he'd be saved?</font>

317
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No. In that moment, he genuinely
thought his life was over.</font>

318
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He was prepared
to accept death and smiled.</font>

319
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain, we have to
apprehend the pirates.</font>

320
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey... have you seen a pirate who
smiled on the execution platform?</font>

321
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-Never! Even if they're acting tough,</font>

322
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">at the moment of death,
they all turn pale and die in despair.</font>

323
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That man in the straw hat smiled...</font>

324
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:20,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">just like the Pirate King, twenty-two years ago in this town...</font>

325
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold Roger smiled on
the execution platform.</font>

326
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain...</font>

327
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where did Straw Hat go?</font>

328
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He ran toward the sea, sir.</font>

329
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's unit one doing? They should've
destroyed their ship by now.</font>

330
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well... They had to return for
refitting because they couldn't</font>

331
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">light the gunpowder
due to the sudden rain...</font>

332
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

333
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A reserve unit is currently
moving to attack the ship instead.</font>

334
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Smoker! If we let them set
sail now, they'll enter the Grand Line!</font>

335
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The wind is blowing westward... Their ship will have a tailwind.</font>

336
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are these all coincidences?</font>

337
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's as if the heavens have
plans for that young man.</font>

338
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'd better hurry
or we'll be in trouble!</font>

339
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">We're gonna make it
to the Grand Line like this! </font>

340
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm White Hound Smoker.</font>

341
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">On my honor as a Marine Headquarters
captain, I won't let that man leave this island!</font>

342
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's with this storm?!</font>

343
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If we don't leave soon,
we'll be stuck here.</font>

344
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami's right that we should
hurry back to the ship!</font>

345
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Attacking me is a waste of time.</font>

346
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There isn't a man alive
who can touch my smooth skin.</font>

347
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I just saw a field of flowers...</font>

348
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Buggy, you're alive!</font>

349
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No way I'd die!</font>

350
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buggy, this isn't good!</font>

351
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Marines from HQ
aren't going to give up.</font>

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hmph. Like I care where
the Marines stick their nose...</font>

353
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Whose nose did you say
is sticking out?!</font>

354
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I didn't say anything like that!</font>

355
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's the plan?!</font>

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum! Go after Gum-Gum!</font>

357
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Mohji and Richie will have
burned down his ship by now.</font>

358
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He can't get off of this island.</font>

359
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll kick his ass
and leave this island, guys!</font>

360
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yeah!
– Yeah!</font>

361
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Motor!</font>

362
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yes, Captain!
– Yes, Captain!</font>

363
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Chop-Chop Buggy!</font>

364
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here we go!</font>

365
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Igniting the bomb engine!</font>

366
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Set the slope!</font>

367
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yes, Big Sis Alvida!
– Yes, Big Sis Alvida!</font>

368
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No Friction...</font>

369
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Smooth-Smooth Tracks!</font>

370
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't let the pirates get away!</font>

371
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh... What's this smoke?!</font>

372
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What the hell...?!</font>

373
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">White Out!</font>

374
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Smoker!</font>

375
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't have time for you small fries!</font>

376
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He's too strong!</font>

377
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The power of the
Smoke-Smoke Fruit...</font>

378
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He took down Buggy's crew
in a split second...</font>

379
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Fire!</font>

380
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain! He caught
us all in one fell swoop!</font>

381
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How dare you, Smoker!</font>

382
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's with this annoying steel net?!
Firing a weird pistol like that...</font>

383
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Marines developed this cage shot
as a way to deal with devil fruit powers.</font>

384
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit!</font>

385
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bring me the Billower Bike!
I'm going after Straw Hat!</font>

386
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, sir!</font>

387
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit!</font>

388
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why the sudden downpour,
when we've gotta burn this ship down?!</font>

389
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit! This is bad, Richie!
We can't get a fire going like this!</font>

390
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One more time!</font>

391
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Be patient, Richie! I'll feed you later.</font>

392
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What're you doing?!</font>

393
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Mohji!</font>

394
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, if it isn't that thief woman.</font>

395
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go, Richie!</font>

396
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Lethal Fresh Egg Star!</font>

397
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You...</font>

398
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn! The rain made my hand slip!</font>

399
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Richie! Just once, could you not...!</font>

400
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now! Let's get on the ship!</font>

401
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah!</font>

402
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold it! You have to get past me!</font>

403
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I am Mohji, first mate of
Buggy the Clown's pirate crew!</font>

404
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I won't let you set even
one foot aboard this sh–</font>

405
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Prepare to fire!</font>

406
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Marines!</font>

407
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is bad!</font>

408
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Aim!</font>

409
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Fire!</font>

410
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Contact the cannon unit!
We'll capture the pirate ship!</font>

411
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:33,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, sir!</font>

412
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-N-N-Nami!</font>

413
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah!</font>

414
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Which direction is the sea?</font>

415
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't tell where we're going
because of all this rain!</font>

416
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There they are!</font>

417
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Persistent bastards!
Should we stop and fight?!</font>

418
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We don't have time.</font>

419
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh?</font>

420
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who's that lady?!</font>

421
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

422
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I didn't realize you were
Roronoa Zoro, and a pirate at that.</font>

423
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You gonna take </i>this<i> sword, too?</i></font>

424
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You... You lied to me!</font>

425
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! What'd you do to her?!</font>

426
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You never asked for my name, is all.</font>

427
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I never lied to you.</font>

428
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Villains like you can't be allowed
to carry a sword of such renown!</font>

429
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I lay claim to the named
blade Wado Ichimonji!</font>

430
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You son of a bitch!
How dare you attack a lady!</font>

431
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go on ahead.</font>

432
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's go.</font>

433
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Zoro! If you hurt
the lady, I won't forgive you!</font>

434
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sergeant Major Tashigi!</font>

435
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is one sword
you won't be getting.</font>

436
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sergeant Major Tashigi lost...</font>

437
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But she's <i>the</i> Sergeant Major Tashigi...</font>

438
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So long. I'm in a hurry, so...</font>

439
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why not finish me off?!</font>

440
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is it because I'm a woman?!</font>

441
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You're lucky, Zoro.
You were born a boy.</i></font>

442
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Men might be physically
stronger than women,</font>

443
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but it's so insulting that
you won't fight seriously!</font>

444
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no way you understand what it
feels like to wish you were born a boy!</font>

445
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't carry a sword as an accessory!</font>

446
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't stand knowing that you exist!</font>

447
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll just tell you! It's your face!</font>

448
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You look exactly like my
good friend who died long ago!</font>

449
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And now you're saying
the same thing she used to!</font>

450
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who are you to imitate
her, you copycat?!</font>

451
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The hell...?! Grow up
and think before you speak!</font>

452
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I am who I am!</font>

453
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't know what your friend was like,
but I'm the one who's upset here!</font>

454
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Maybe <i>she's</i> the copycat!</font>

455
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What'd you say?!</font>

456
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I see the exit! The harbor is right there!</font>

457
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, who is it now?</font>

458
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're finally here...</font>

459
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

460
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Inherited will...</i></font>

461
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>the tides of time,
and humanity's dreams...</i></font>

462
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>They cannot be stopped.</i></font>

463
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>As long as people seek freedom,</i></font>

464
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>these things will never cease to be.</i></font>

465
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A pirate, huh? Fine by me.</font>

466
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm Captain Smoker.
I run Loguetown for the Marines.</font>

467
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're under arrest.</font>

468
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh? Arrest? Forget it!</font>

469
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm on my way to the Grand Line
to become King of the Pirates!</font>

470
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">King of the Pirates?</font>

471
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I refuse to get arrested
in a place like this!</font>

472
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then you'll have to beat me first.</font>

473
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Luffy...</font>

474
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sanji, go on ahead. I'll be right there.</font>

475
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Fire!</font>

476
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Fire the cannons!</font>

477
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If we stay here any longer,
the <i>Going Merry</i> will be sunk!</font>

478
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-You're about to set sail?
Luffy and them aren't back yet!</font>

479
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're out of options!
It's better than getting sunk!</font>

480
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right rudder full!</font>

481
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So what about Luffy's group?</font>

482
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll pick them up later!</font>

483
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't let them get away! Follow them!</font>

484
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami!</font>

485
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sanji!</font>

486
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sanji!</font>

487
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami, I'm back!</font>

488
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where're Luffy and Zoro?</font>

489
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can we even collect
those damn idiots?!</font>

490
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sanji!</font>

491
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Behind you!</font>

492
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn, there's no end to 'em!</font>

493
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll cover him! Bring me closer!</font>

494
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't! There's a strong current
keeping us from shore!</font>

495
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Ah, screw it!</font>

496
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

497
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bastards!</font>

498
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp! Sanji!</font>

499
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! What?! What's going on?!</font>

500
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I ate the Smoke-Smoke Fruit,
so my body become smoke at will!</font>

501
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's wrong? Had enough?</font>

502
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum Gatling!</font>

503
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What? Eww, that's gross!</font>

504
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">White Blow!</font>

505
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You jerk!</font>

506
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum Pistol!</font>

507
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get it now? You can't
enter the Grand Line.</font>

508
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's what I'm telling you!</font>

509
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're wanted for thirty million belly?</font>

510
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Looks like you've run out
of your devil's luck.</font>

511
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be so sure.</font>

512
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're...</font>

513
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What's happening? Who is it? Who's there?</font>

514
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The government is after your head.</font>

515
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The world is waiting for our answer.</font>

516
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-This is...</font>

517
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What just happened?</font>

518
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy!</font>

519
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy!</font>

520
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami!</font>

521
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'd better hurry before
the ship is swept away!</font>

522
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright!</font>

523
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum...</font>

524
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wha...?!</font>

525
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">W-Wait!</font>

526
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I have a bad feeling...</font>

527
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Rocket!</font>

528
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Ahhh, I knew it!</font>

529
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everyone...!</font>

530
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Seriously, that flashy gust
was a lucky break.</font>

531
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This escape was possible because
I always keep my wits about me.</font>

532
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where to now?</font>

533
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:24,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's head straight to
the Grand Line. How nostalgic!</font>

534
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:41,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If that's your decision, then go!</font>

535
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why?! Why did you help that man...</font>

536
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dragon?!</font>

537
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What reason would there be to
interfere with a man's departure?</font>

538
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Set sail! We're going after Straw Hat!</font>

539
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?</font>

540
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're entering the Grand Line.</font>

541
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">B-But, Captain!
This island is your post.</font>

542
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What would the higher-ups say?!</font>

543
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tell them I said,
"Don't order me around!"</font>

544
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm coming with you!</font>

545
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sergeant Major Tashigi!</font>

546
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't let Roronoa get away!</font>

547
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll capture him without fail!</font>

548
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Whoa! It feels like
the ship's gonna tip over!</font>

549
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">See that light?</font>

550
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The island's lighthouse?</font>

551
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's a "guiding light."</font>

552
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The entrance to the Grand Line
lies just beyond that light.</font>

553
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Grand Line is past that light...</font>

554
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What do you wanna do?</font>

555
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">D-Do we have to enter
during a storm like this?</font>

556
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay, then! Shall we hold a launch
ceremony for entering this great sea?</font>

557
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey!</font>

558
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh! Sounds good!</font>

559
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's do it!</font>

560
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To find the All Blue!</font>

561
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To be King of the Pirates!</font>

562
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To become the greatest swordsman!</font>

563
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To draw a map of the world!</font>

564
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:35,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">T-To become a brave warrior of the sea!</font>

565
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're going... to the Grand Line!</font>

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yeah!
– Yeah!</font>
