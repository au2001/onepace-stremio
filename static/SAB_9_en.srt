29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he must be!</font>

30
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna see him again, too!</font>

32
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was supposed to coat your ship, right?</font>

33
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, ship-coating costs a lot of money...</font>

34
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's fine, Hachi.</font>

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a question.</font>

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Exactly what is the "Will of D"?</font>

00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the Poneglyph I saw on Sky Island...</font>

46
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger's name was engraved with the ancient language.</font>

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did he know those letters?</font>

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I have come here, and I will lead these words to the end.</i></font>

49
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pirate Gol D. Roger.</i></font>

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you people know what happened during the "void century" 900 years ago?</font>

51
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we know.</font>

52
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We learned the entire history.</font>

53
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, miss...</font>

54
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be hasty.</font>

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please push forward with your ship, one step at a time.</font>

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps we, as well as Ohara, were too impatient.</font>

57
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to tell you the entire history here and now...</font>

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it's not like you could do anything the way you are now.</font>

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After you've taken your time to see the world...</font>

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The conclusion you'll reach might be different from what we found.</font>

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you still want to hear it, then I'll tell you everything about the world now.</font>

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, don't tell me.</font>

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll continue on the journey.</font>

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll see it all eventually.</font>

65
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too bad about what happened to your homeland, Ohara.</font>

66
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Roger couldn't actually read those letters.</font>

67
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were pirates.</font>

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We couldn't possibly compare to the genius Clover, or the other Oharans' intelligence.</font>

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He...</font>

70
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could hear the "voice of all things".</font>

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's all there is.</font>

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you sure, Robin?</font>

73
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you just let a great chance slip away?!</font>

74
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, old man!</font>

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna ask something too!</font>

76
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary treasure, One Piece...</font>

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really...</font>

78
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

79
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna hear where the treasure is!</font>

80
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't even wanna hear if there <i>is</i> a treasure or not!</font>

81
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno anything about it, but everyone sets off to sea to find out for themselves!</font>

82
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Pops were to tell us anything here, then I'll quit on becoming Pirate King!</font>

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're gonna have a boring adventure like that, then I won't do it!</font>

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I got it!</font>

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got it!</font>

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, I just got carried away!</font>

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna hear anything either!</font>

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah!</font>

89
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got the "I'll die if I hear anything about One Piece"-disease!</font>

90
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So don't you dare say anything, old man!</font>

91
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you do it?</font>

92
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Grand Line far exceeds anything than you can imagine.</font>

93
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemies will be strong too.</font>

94
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you conquer such a terrifying sea?</font>

95
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna conquer anything!</font>

96
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just that the person with the most freedom on the sea is the Pirate King!</font>

97
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

98
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really a big fan of yours, Monkey-chan.</font>

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship is in Grove 41, right?</font>

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be going there.</font>

101
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about you?</font>

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The admiral is still coming to this island, you know.</font>

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll just cause trouble if we stay here...</font>

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, let's go somewhere...</font>

105
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And shop!</font>

106
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you out of your mind?!</font>

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're being chased, so we have to stay hidden!</font>

108
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's right.</font>

109
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay together, people will probably come after us.</font>

110
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to get off more smoothly, it'd be better for us to split up in town.</font>

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, we'll just randomly split up into groups and gather up there when he's done, right?</font>

112
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Talking about gathering up like it's a plan...</font>

113
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whose mouth did that come from?</font>

114
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shakki, you have that, right?</font>

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I've got one.</font>

116
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a Vivrecard!</font>

117
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, if you know about it, that makes things easier.</font>

118
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a wanted man too...</font>

119
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I think I'll move the ship from Grove 41 and work on it somewhere else.</font>

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The coating should take about three days.</font>

121
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It takes three whole days?</font>

122
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your lives depend on my work, so that's the fastest I can do.</font>

123
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, we have to survive for three days...</font>

124
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary!</font>

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we say sunset in three days?</font>

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not sure which grove I'll be in...</font>

127
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But just follow the Vivrecard, and I'll be waiting for you with the ship coated.</font>

128
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd better go buy whatever supplies you'll need for your underwater trip to Fishman Island.</font>

129
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot, Luffy-chin and everyone!</font>

130
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, thanks!</font>

131
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This all happened because of me, so sorry!</font>

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To show our gratitude, we'll show you the way to Fishman Island, so don't worry!</font>

133
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out for the navy for the next three days!</font>

134
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi, watch your health.</font>

135
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's meet again in three days.</font>

136
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be there to send you off, okay?</font>

137
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya later, granny!</font>

138
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're up against an admiral!</font>

139
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll have to make sure that none of us die, eh?</font>

140
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't say scary stuff like that!</font>

141
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three days, huh?</font>

142
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, let's go...</font>

143
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the amusement park!</font>

144
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

145
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care!</font>

146
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be too reckless!</font>

147
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you too!</font>

148
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll leave Hachi to you!</font>

149
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I should go, then.</font>

150
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I'm counting on you!</font>

151
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But who'd have thought...</font>

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that we'd meet one of the Pirate King's crew mate in a place like this?</font>

153
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It surprised me.</font>

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I put it... He really left an impression, especially for a geezer.</font>

155
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, he is the most famous of Roger's crewmates, after all.</font>

156
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he was a crew mate on the Oro Jackson, huh?</font>

157
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I did assist a man named Roger...</i></font>

158
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad I met him.</font>

159
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you're the type of guy who respects his elders?</font>

160
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It happens from time to time!</font>

161
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

162
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't we go to the amusement park?</font>

163
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you shut up?!</font>

164
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to go...</font>

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, too?!</font>

168
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to run!</font>

169
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capture the pirates!</font>

170
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

171
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of wanted pirates around!</font>

172
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out for those with bounties exceeding 100 million!</font>

173
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

174
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello? This is Kizaru...</font>

175
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, that's odd...</font>

178
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How strange...</font>

179
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really bad!</font>

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I...</font>

181
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to take him down, I'd become famous at once!</font>

182
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be a fool! He's one of the navy's strongest fighters!</font>

183
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now! You...</font>

184
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

185
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

186
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Hey, I'm sure I just hit him!</font>

187
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It definitely passed through his head!</font>

188
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, that's really odd...</font>

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's obvious that he's got some sort of ability!</font>

190
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way a gun would work!</font>

191
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

192
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to ask you a question...</font>

193
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm looking for a man named Sentoumaru...</font>

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy's my subordinate, you see...</font>

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh, I was just asking...</font>

196
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you think that's going too far, Kizaru-san?</font>

197
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't destroy the Yarukiman Mangroves!</font>

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oops, seems like I overdid it...</font>

199
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's totally messed up...</font>

200
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, that's Admiral Kizaru?</font>

201
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apoo-san! We're in trouble, too!</font>

202
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to get away!</font>

203
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such an idiot.</font>

204
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the fun in just running away?</font>

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta upset the enemy before we go.</font>

206
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you planning to do?!</font>

207
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Requesting backup at the port!</font>

208
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

209
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know!</font>

210
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea, but all our troops...</font>

211
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">have turned into children and old men!</font>

212
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My back is killing me...</font>

214
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is classic!</font>

215
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's her doing!</font>

216

217
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out for the rookies with bounties over 100 million!</font>

218
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You dog!</font>

219
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Capone "Gang" Bege, the guy with 138 million on your head, right?!</font>

220
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll never reach the sea!</font>

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to your subordinates?! Are they moving independently?!</font>

222
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an unlucky man you are... Surrender!</font>

223
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got you guys beaten...</font>

224
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">when it comes to military might.</font>

225
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'd like to ask you something...</font>

226
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">K-Kizaru!</font>

227
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We'll take care of this...</font>

228
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, please run away!</font>

229
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not panic.</font>

230
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not die today.</font>

231
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you, we'll hide in the amusement park!</font>

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop lying.</font>

233
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd just play around, flashily at that.</font>

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

235
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're under attack!</font>

236
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't just stand around!</font>

237
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Standby to attack!</font>

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring out the cannons!</font>

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the gates!</font>

240
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Commence attack!</font>

241
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

242
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shoot!</font>

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

244
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy's got something inside his body!</font>

245
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It got bigger...!</font>

246
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't even do anything!</font>

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cavalry, charge!</font>

249
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's coming out of his stomach again!</font>

250
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An army is coming out!</font>

251
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now it's horses?!</font>

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capone "Gang" Bege...</font>

253
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of power does he have?!</font>

254
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Firing squad, take aim!</font>

255
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with the smoke?</font>

256
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, there's too much smoke!</font>

257
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said, I've got you outnumbered!</font>

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and run!</font>

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that the Seven Warlords are on the move!</font>

261
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously? Who?</font>

262
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Seven Warlords?!</font>

266
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a bit of a stubborn streak!</font>

267
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,480
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Island Grove 24</font>

268
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you. Run, Captain Hawkins!</font>

269
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hawkins!</font>

270
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Battle: Probability of defeat, 100%...</font>

271
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have a moment?</font>

272
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Escape: Probability of success, 12%...</font>

273
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm trying to find a man named Sentoumaru...</font>

274
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Defense: Probability of evasion, 76%...</font>

275
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not know that man.</font>

276
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please ask someone else.</font>

277
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if I can't find him...</font>

278
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't have anything to do...</font>

279
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And with that being the case, there's no way I'd let someone with a bounty like yours, go free.</font>

280
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bounty of 249 million, "The Mage", Basil Hawkins...</font>

281
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speed is weight.</font>

282
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you ever experienced a light-speed kick?</font>

283
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

284
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,480
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 27</font>

285
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

286
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what happened?!</font>

287
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know! He just suddenly flew off!</font>

288
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,670
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 24</font>

289
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really strong.</font>

290
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, is he still gonna fight?!</font>

291
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,190
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Archipelago Harbor</font>

292
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what was that?</font>

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just suddenly...</font>

294
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must have been attacked from somewhere...</font>

295
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 24</font>

296
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

297
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should have guessed, you are far stronger than I imagined.</font>

298
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How odd...</font>

299
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've beaten two already...</font>

300
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Having only ten bodies against an admiral is pretty discouraging...</font>

301
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the "Mad Monk", Urouge!</font>

302
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not just him!</font>

303
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one of the Seven Warlords, Bartholomew Kuma!</font>

304
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got me... He's too strong!</font>

305
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me... that's Kizaru?!</font>

306
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got terrible luck!</font>

307
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A navy admiral in front of me...</font>

308
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Warlord behind me...</font>

309
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the end for me?!</font>

310
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't say that.</font>

311
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I still do not see the mark of death upon you.</font>

312
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

313
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hawkins from North Blue, huh?</font>

314
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may be my enemy, but I appreciate the joke!</font>

315
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Another one showed up!</font>

316
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's "Red Flag", X-Drake!</font>

317
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

318
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rear admiral, Drake...</font>

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, I didn't intend to meet Kizaru!</font>

320
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty badly beaten, but let's see...</font>

321
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if there really is some hope of victory!</font>

322
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, it's time for my counterattack!</font>

323
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! This has become quite the situation.</font>

324
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, this is interesting!</font>

325
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in trouble!</font>

326
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys are all gonna die!</font>

327
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is our chance to run, right?!</font>

328
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?</font>

329
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where the fun begins!</font>

330
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,170
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 12</font>

331
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

332
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stand back, Luffy!</font>

333
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's one of the Seven Warlords!</font>

334
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seven Warlords?</font>

335
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you know?</font>

336
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, don't let that attack hit you!</font>

337
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shockwave!</font>

338
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

339
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could even do this?!</font>

340
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that's not a shockwave!</font>

341
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a...</font>

342
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!</font>

343
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to be happy!</font>

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartholomew Kuma... Why is he here again?!</font>

345
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard...!</font>

346
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he that guy who showed up afterwards on Thriller Bark?!</font>

347
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's him!</font>

348
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back then, he made some shockwave from the pads on his hand and caused us a lot of trouble!</font>

349
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was planning to eliminate us there, but...</font>

350
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess he realized we survived and came back!</font>

351
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back then, you sure got us good!</font>

352
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Vent</font>

353
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked!</font>

354
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

355
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!</font>

356
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second</font>

357
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already know you're strong, so I'll go all-out right away!</font>

358
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got no choice!</font>

359
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's strange...</font>

360
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He feels different from back then...</font>

361
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it just my imagination?</font>

362
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

363
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:51,720
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 36</font>

364
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's late!</font>

365
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The warships should be here by now...</font>

366
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's strange...</font>

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why hasn't he contacted me yet, that old man Kizaru...</font>

368
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he doesn't hurry up...</font>

369
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to...</font>

370
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">finish off all those rookies!</font>
