00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Once there was a man who obtained everything,
the legendary Pirate King Gold Roger.</i></font>

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>His last words before he was executed inspired people to sail the seas.</i></font>

00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,580
<font face="Pristina" size="65" color="#e7cdb2"><b>All my wealth and treasure?</b></font>

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,190
<font face="Pristina" size="65" color="#e7cdb2"><b>It can be yours if you want!</b></font>

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,340
<font face="Pristina" size="65" color="#e7cdb2"><b>Search for it!</b></font>

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,760
<font face="Pristina" size="65" color="#e7cdb2"><b>I left everything in that one place.</b></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>People now set sail in search of romance.</i></font>

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The world has entered a Great Age of Pirates!</i></font>

9
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What were they for?</font>

10
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In ancient times, there existed in this world the power to destroy everything.</font>

11
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three ancient weapons named after the gods...</font>

12
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon.</font>

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And she is one of those weapons.</font>

14
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

15
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be awful
if anyone found out about this, right?</font>

16
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that all the major influences around the world would want to claim Shirahoshi's power for their own.</font>

17
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both the Government and the pirates.</font>

18
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An ancient weapon?
The power to destroy the world, you say?!</font>

19
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I'd just say goodbye to this place now that I have all their treasure,</font>

20
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I've overheard something
pretty amazing here, haven't I?</font>

21
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so the Mermaid Princess is...</font>

22
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Luffy.</font>

23
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much do you know about what's happening in the world?</font>

24
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this, all of a sudden?</font>

25
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Judging from that answer,
I guess you don't know anything.</font>

26
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried about your lack of interest.</font>

27
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

28
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thank you for waiting.</i></font>

29
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you come outside and talk?</font>

30
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, just wait a second.</font>

31
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm bringing the food with me!</font>

32
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, you guys are here too?</font>

33
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I drank a lot.
I'm recovering from drinking too much booze.</font>

34
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm recovering from eating too much food.</font>

35
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji's recovering from seeing too much mermaid.</font>

36
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaid Island... is the greatest...</font>

37
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  Akainu and Aokiji got into a big fight?!</font>

38
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I was right.
You don't even know about an event that big?</font>

39
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.  I didn't hear anything during my training.</font>

40
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rayleigh was pretty strict, huh?</font>

41
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard about it!  I did!</font>

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?!</font>

43
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Immediately after the war two years ago,</font>

44
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleet Admiral Sengoku decided to retire.</font>

45
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sengoku wanted his trusted subordinate, Aokiji,
to become his successor...</font>

46
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there were many high ranked government officials
who wanted Akainu instead...</font>

47
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so they both became candidates for the position.</font>

48
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aokiji rarely shows interest in anything...</font>

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he was strongly opposed
to Akainu becoming Fleet Admiral.</font>

50
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two disagreed, and the unprecedented quarrel
between two Admirals escalated...</font>

51
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">until they finally settled it in a duel on a certain island.</font>

52
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dead men tell no tales.</font>

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The loser would no longer be around to complain. {He doesn't outright say that the loser will be unable to complain because he's dead, but it's very heavily implied.}</font>

54
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Control of the Navy would
pass into the hands of whoever won the duel.</font>

55
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their deathmatch lasted for ten days, and became a subject of conversation all over the world.</font>

56
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were almost equal in terms of power,
but the battle finally reached a conclusion.</font>

57
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The winner was Akainu.
Sakazuki is the new Fleet Admiral of the Navy!</font>

58
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Akainu!</font>

59
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're mine! {Copy-paste from 487}</i></font>

60
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Aokiji die?</font>

61
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were both gravely injured...</font>

62
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I suppose when he saw
his former comrade collapse before him,</font>

63
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">even Akainu felt some remorse.</font>

64
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aokiji refused to serve under Akainu...</font>

65
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so he left the Navy.</font>

66
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

67
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, Aokiji isn't a marine any more?</font>

68
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  Who knows where he is now,
or what he's planning.</font>

69
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, the Navy has lost a valuable asset.</font>

70
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the Government has a plan to fill that power vacuum...</font>

71
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and it gives the Navy almost unthinkable power.</font>

72
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, all of you.  A lot of things have happened in the New World over the past two years,</font>

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there are two changes in particular that you must keep in mind.</font>

74
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all, Navy HQ under Sakazuki's command...</font>

75
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has become an even more powerful force for justice.</font>

76
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other...</font>

77
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is the rise of the Blackbeard Pirates!</font>

78
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?</font>

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people we met in Mock Town, right?</font>

80
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guys who once ravaged my homeland!</font>

81
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Long time no see, Straw Hat! {End copy-paste from 446}</i></font>

82
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He had been with the Whitebeard Pirates
for quite a while.</font>

83
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was familiar with their territory, and after the Old Man died...</font>

84
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he went and took it over almost immediately.</font>

85
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And did it by using the very same Gura Gura power
he'd stolen from him.</font>

86
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Among society, he already ranks up with...</font>

87
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Red Hair...</font>

88
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kaidou...</font>

89
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and Big Mom...</font>

90
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as one of the Four Emperors.</font>

91
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he just snuck in and took Whitebeard's place.</font>

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an insufferable guy.</font>

93
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He truly is a damnable man.</font>

94
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rumor has it that they're out hunting Devil Fruit users.</font>

95
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know how they do it, but they can kill Devil Fruit users and take their powers.</font>

96
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard and his crew's goal is to
collect even stronger Devil Fruit powers.</font>

97
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful.</font>

98
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in danger!</font>

99
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think they need the Hito Hito Fruit.</font>

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

101
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun, you have...</font>

102
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a lot of history with Blackbeard... with Teach.</font>

103
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to be...</font>

104
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy!</i></font>

105
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Are you even listening?!</i></font>

106
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the captain, aren't you?!</font>

107
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should at least pay attention
to the important parts!</font>

108
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, don't worry about it, Jinbe.  We all heard it.</font>

109
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  You mean a captain <i>isn't</i>
someone who ignores everything people say?</font>

110
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being the captain means you're responsible
for the lives of your crewmates, does it not, Luffy?!</font>

111
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah, Jinbe, just take it easy.</font>

112
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like to leave it to chance, after all.</font>

113
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure this has been hard on all of you.</font>

114
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Absolutely.</i></font>

115
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Caimie!</font>

116
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, I don't see Weak-Hoshi around.</font>

117
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Princess said she was a little tired
and wanted to rest.  She just went to her room.</font>

118
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro!</font>

119
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

120
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it just me...</font>

121
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or is there something like a wild animal in the palace?</font>

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

123
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It does feel like something's here.</font>

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody!</font>

125
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't do this!</font>

126
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please just tell me who you are!</font>

127
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody!  Anybody!</font>

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make such a bitter face, Your Highness!</font>

129
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry, this isn't gonna hurt.</font>

130
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After I stole the treasure, selling mermaids seemed like more trouble than it's worth...</font>

131
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you're a special case!</font>

132
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just need you to go to sleep for a little while!</font>

133
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My brother and the others just let me know
that they've arrived here!</font>

134
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go to the New World together!</font>

135
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, let's see a smile.</font>

137
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Licky-licky.  Licky-licky.  Licky-licky.  Leee!</font>

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

139
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw Hat?!</i></font>

140
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

141
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy was still here?</font>

142
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

143
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so terrified!</font>

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so damn lucky, Luffy!</font>

145
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should have kicked him, dammit!</font>

146
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was so close!  Once again, we are in your debt.</font>

147
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't sweat it.</font>

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe that treasure thief was still in the castle.</font>

149
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usually, not even a single minnow
could find its way into the castle...</font>

150
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the gate was left open
during the chaos of the battle.</font>

151
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  The tower to the right was cut clean in half!</font>

152
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure it was the treasure thief
who took advantage of our absence and...</font>

153
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it was this guy who cut the tower.</font>

154
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When they were escaping from the cage, he showed off by cutting the bars and the room clean in half.</font>

155
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let him take the blame, you dumb starfish!</font>

156
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with you?!
Lying is the first step to becoming a thief!</font>

157
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second, Right Minister-chan!</font>

158
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chan?</font>

159
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, treasure thief?!</font>

160
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just what it sounds like.
That man stole all the treasure in the palace.</font>

161
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, that guy?</font>

162
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've got a bad feeling about this...</i></font>

163
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are your country's treasures, right?!  Aren't you gonna go after him?</font>

164
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Compared to the lives of all our citizens, the treasure is completely insignificant.</font>

165
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like hell it is!</font>

166
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, if we take it back...</font>

167
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be my honor to bestow the treasure
upon our country's saviors.</font>

168
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

169
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you!  Why'd you send him flying?!</font>

170
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you just knock him out
and tie him up here?!</font>

171
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even when she's angry, Nami-san is still-</i></font>

172
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go find him, right now!</i></font>

173
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

174
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's happened to Hody and his crew!  And their handcuffs have come off!</font>

175
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

176
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans!  Our malice will not end...</font>

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The time of our revenge will still come.</font>

178
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring Straw Hat to me... I will kill him.</font>

179
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I drunk?  My joints hurt...{ Btwb: Placed an ellipsis here since it does sound like he trails off. }</font>

180
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got old on purpose.</font>

181
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, we will get revenge on the Straw Hats -fosun...</font>

182
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will bestow judgment upon the humans.</font>

183
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is all this?!</font>

184
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this really Hody's crew?!</font>

185
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think you can keep me in a cage,
you dumb king!</font>

186
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-These bars...</font>

187
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hody!</font>

188
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?!</font>

189
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought, the Energy Steroids you've been using...</font>

190
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were the pills from the legendary Tamate Box, right?!</font>

191
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tamate Box?</font>

192
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A national treasure passed down
through the generations on Fishman Island -jamon.</font>

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, ten years ago...</font>

194
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there was an incident when
the contents of the Tamate Box were stolen.</font>

195
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't know who was responsible, and His Majesty decided to keep it secret to avoid panic.</font>

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I think about it,</font>

197
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it happened when you left the army, Hody!</font>

198
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  I stole them.</font>

199
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fools.</font>

200
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the legends are unclear what those pills do.</font>

201
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some legends claim that they can
give you the power of a thousand men,</font>

202
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">others say that they just make you old.</font>

203
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As far as a national treasure go, they're rather peculiar.</font>

204
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm guessing that they're just a vile drug, and were heavily guarded to prevent the dangerous effects.</font>

205
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You opened a box that should have never been opened,</font>

206
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">gained some power,
and became deluded with grandeur -jamon.</font>

207
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, Neptune!</font>

208
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll never be able to
carry out your revenge like this.</font>

209
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

210
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are the destined avengers!</font>

211
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will definitely slaughter...</font>

212
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">both you and the humans!</font>

213
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that it's come to this, I pity you.
I'll have to reconsider your punishment.</font>

214
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi, you're a disgrace to our species!</font>

215
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You killed my mother,
but I bear no grudge against you.</font>

216
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So please...  Be quiet now.</font>

217
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We mustn't let our island's children hear you.</font>

218
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Left Minister!</font>

219
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir Pekoms and Baron Tamago are at the Candy Factory!</font>

220
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom's subordinates... are here now?!</font>

221
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no candy to offer her this month.</font>

222
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody and his crew destroyed the factory,</font>

223
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and everyone wanted to give the candy that wasn't destroyed to the Straw Hats...</font>

224
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so we took it to the banquet!</font>

225
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know if excuses will be enough.</font>

226
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're dealing with a monster
who's willing to destroy whole countries over candy!</font>

227
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Four Emperors...</font>

228
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom!</font>

229
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The feast has been properly enjoyed, and has come to a proper close.</i></font>

230
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  We can have the treasure?!</font>

231
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

232
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well ain't that fortunate?</font>

233
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will Luffy-sama and the others be alright,
Nami-chin-sama?</font>

234
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, don't worry about them.</font>

235
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're making it big
just as we break into the New World!</font>

236
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is life really that simple?</font>

237
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Usopp!  Why don't we go look, too?</font>

238
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really shouldn't.  Upon checking, I found out...</font>

239
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that my bounty is over two hundred million beli!</font>

240
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  But I'm still only worth fifty.</font>

241
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look, Zoro and Sanji!</font>

242
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!  That was easy!</font>

243
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So your punch already knocked him out?
How boring.</font>

244
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an impressive pile!</font>

245
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the shaggy king really going to
give all of this to us?</font>

246
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!  I'll be able to buy tons of meat with this!</font>

247
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He really had all of this
stored inside that swampy body of his?</font>

248
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Heave-ho!</i></font>

249
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, back to Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

250
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How?</font>

251
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll need a flying fish.</font>

252
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which way to town, Zoro?</font>

253
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there.</font>

254
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay then, we go the other way!</font>

255
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

256
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, Left Minister...</font>

257
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it too much to ask
for some sort of leniency this one time?</font>

258
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The factory was unexpectedly attacked by Hody's crew, so...</font>

259
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your little rebellion has nothing to do with us -gao!</font>

260
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was planning to take a little taste for myself,
and now I'm starving!</font>

261
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You give us an offering of candy once a month,</font>

262
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and we give you Mama's name to protect you!</font>

263
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't that the deal?!</font>

264
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're business partners, so I didn't want to say this...</font>

265
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you know how terrifying Mama is, don't you?!</font>

266
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make her mad, and you'll...</font>

267
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">be annihilated!</font>

268
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so cute when he makes threats.</font>

269
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pay your protection -gao!</font>

270
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a crowd over there!</font>

271
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Candy Factory that Pappagg talked about!</font>

272
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  I hope there are some flying fish here.</font>

273
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This must be where they made
all that delicious candy we had earlier!</font>

274
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Candy Factory!</font>

275
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

276
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!  Is the feast over?</font>

277
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun!  What are you doing here?!</font>

278
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  I'm stuffed!</font>

279
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The meat was great too,
but the candy from Fishman Island is just the best!</font>

280
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

281
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Straw Hat-san...</font>

282
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell them that!</font>

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  Mr. Droopy Mustache!  You're here too?!</font>

284
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he just say candy?!  Who's this guy?!</font>

285
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!  That's Straw Hat Luffy!  No doubt about it.</font>

286
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's such a famous pirate doing here?</font>

287
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, well...</font>

288
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, kid!  What did you say about the candy?!</font>

289
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Sir Pekoms, you see...</font>

290
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?  You're not a fishman.</font>

291
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you come to buy candy?</font>

292
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just ate until my stomach was about to burst!</font>

293
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

294
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is the meaning of this?!
He's saying he ate all the candy!</font>

295
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, well, you see... There is a reason for...</font>

296
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  A talking lion!</font>

297
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever.
We've got a similar guy in our crew too.</font>

298
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms.</font>

299
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Recklessly threatening everyone
won't necessarily help us collect the candy.</font>

300
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us find a peaceful solution to this -<i>soir.</i></font>

301
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tea party isn't for another four days -<i>bon.</i></font>

302
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we set off tomorrow morning, we can still make it -<i>jour.</i></font>

303
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another weirdo.  Who are you?</font>

304
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Bon</i> day to you.
I am a soft-boiled member of our pirate crew.</font>

305
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I go by the name of Baron Tamago -<i>soir.</i></font>

306
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Tamago: Egg</i></font>

307
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Egg?</font>

308
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please remember my name, at least -<i>s'il vous plait.</i></font>

309
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incidentally, my dear fellows...</font>

310
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you just say something about eating
all the candy this factory produced -<i>c'est si bon?</i></font>

311
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he, a compass?</font>

312
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  I'd love to eat more if they had any!</font>

313
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it is precisely because they don't that we are in this quandary -<i>bon.</i></font>

314
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:23,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That mark up on the factory is the flag of our boss,
the great pirate Charlotte Linlin -<i>soir.</i></font>

315
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That flag marks this island
as part of the Emperor Big Mom's territory.</font>

316
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meaning!  Fishman Island is being protected by Big Mom's name -<i>bon!</i></font>

317
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must be nice!  I'd love to meet her!</font>

318
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom, huh?</font>

319
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make no mistake.  This is just business!</font>

320
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten tons of candy per month.</font>

321
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the price they must pay to fly that flag -<i>bon.</i></font>

322
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten tons?!</font>

323
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  Mama loves sweets
more than anything else -<i>soir.</i></font>

324
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island candy in particular, is her favorite.</font>

325
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we will wait until tomorrow morning.</font>

326
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no, Baron... Like I was just saying,
all the ovens in the factory are broken...</font>

327
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and it'll take several days to repair them,
so at least give us two weeks to-</font>

328
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No can do -<i>soir.</i></font>

329
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Egg!  Why can't you just wait?!</font>

330
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could one of the Four Emperors be such a small balled bastard?</font>

331
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She is no bastard!
Mama is a great female pirate -<i>vous plait.</i></font>

332
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She does not have any balls at all -<i>jour.</i></font>

333
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So she's a Madame?</font>

334
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I love candy... and you too, since you can make it.</font>

335
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what happens
if she doesn't get the candy on time?</font>

336
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happens...</font>

337
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">our agreement will be null and void!</font>

338
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in a few short days, Big Mom will send
valiant warriors to destroy Fishman Island -<i>vous plait!</i></font>

339
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Destroy Fishman Island?!</font>

340
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you, stupid?!
You think I'll let this country fall because of candy?!</font>

341
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We <i>just</i> saved this island!</font>

342
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem happy, Mama.</font>

343
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm looking forward to the tea party in four days!</font>

344
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be able to eat that delicious candy from Fishman Island again!</font>

345
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so excited, my stomach acid is just gushing out.</font>

346
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So excited!  So excited!  Fishman Island candy!</i></font>

347
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're looking forward to it too?</font>

348
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But of course!  That candy is a masterpiece!</i></font>

349
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then... you can look forward to it from inside my gut!</font>

350
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama!</font>

351
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back!</font>

352
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right... So how did it go, Bobbin?</font>

353
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We took care of 'em, then burned it down!</font>

354
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.  That country's baked sweets were the best!</font>

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure the burning country must have smelled nice?</font>

356
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too bad, but it couldn't be helped.</font>

357
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They failed to deliver the promised sweets, after all.</font>

358
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got any snacks?</font>

359
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone who won't give me candy must be killed.</font>

360
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate people who tell me
they'll give it to me and then don't!</font>

361
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate them as much as bitter candy!</font>

362
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speaking of which...</font>

363
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently Fishman Island might not
be able to deliver the candy for this month.</font>

364
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms just contacted me.</font>

365
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should we burn down Fishman Island, too?</font>

366
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The candy from Fishman Island isn't coming?!</font>

367
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get me the Snail Phone right now!</font>

368
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be Mama -gao!</font>

369
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just explained the situation to her.</font>

370
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A... A message from Big Mom herself?!</font>

371
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Pekoms!</font>

372
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You answer it -gao!  I don't want her to yell at me!</font>

373
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?!</font>

374
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!</i></font>

375
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!</i></font>

376
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you Big Mom?!</font>

377
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i></font>

378
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not Tamago, nor Pekoms.</font>

379
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

380
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Monkey D. Luffy!
The man who will become the Pirate King!</font>

381
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i></font>

382
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun!</font>

383
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san!</font>

384
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey... D?</font>

385
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, Garp's grandson?</font>

386
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I remember!</font>

387
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're that kid who caused a ruckus during the war two years ago, right?</font>

388
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no candy here!</font>

389
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ate all of it!</font>

390
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There really isn't any at all?!
There was supposed to be ten tons of it!</font>

391
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I ate all ten tons!</i></font>

392
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san, you don't have to do this!</font>

393
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he trying to do?!</font>

394
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an idiot you are!  Don't lie to me!</font>

395
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're covering for the fishmen, aren't you?</font>

396
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's true that I ate it!</font>

397
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know it was promised to someone else.</font>

398
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got tons of treasure here.</font>

399
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give all of it to you as compensation for the candy!</font>

400
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Treasure?!</i></font>

401
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  As if I could eat treasure!</font>

402
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to eat sweet candy!</font>

403
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second!  Is that all treasure?!</font>

404
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yup.</font>

405
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama, this is Tamago speaking!  Let's think about this calmly!</font>

406
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A few days days ago, that brat, Captain Kid, sunk two ships that we were supposed to protect -<i>bon!</i></font>

407
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They lost a lot of money.  To tell the truth, we've been needing a little money to settle that problem -<i>bon!</i></font>

408
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just this once, the smart choice would be
to wait another two weeks for the candy,</font>

409
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and accept this treasure
as an apology for their blunder -<i>jour!</i></font>

410
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for your sweets, we'll pick up the sweetest and most savory we can find on our way back.</font>

411
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta be kidding me, Tamago!</font>

412
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you say such a disgraceful thing.</font>

413
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What pirate would ever accept a compromise for the things she wants?!</font>

414
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I- I'm <i>soir</i>y!</font>

415
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although...</font>

416
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this brat who's willing to stand up to me
has piqued my interest.</font>

417
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you wish, just this once...</font>

418
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll change my target from Fishman Island to you!</font>

419
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Luffy...</font>

420
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll remember you. { tlc: It's because I remember you. }</font>

421
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come, to the New World!</font>

422
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun!</font>

423
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.  Just you wait!</font>

424
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got something to settle with you now.</font>

425
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

426
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too dangerous to trust!</font>

427
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll kick your ass in the New World...</font>

428
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and make Fishman Island my turf!</i></font>
