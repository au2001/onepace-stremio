00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, Ivankov and Inazuma all have Devil Fruit powers!</font>

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget to bring your prison bullets!</font>

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've arrived at Level Six!</font>

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charge!</font>

5
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this stone structure?</font>

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way!</font>

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they still here?! Find them!</font>

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seriously think anyone would open a hole like that and <i>not</i> run? Idiot.</font>

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Head Jailer Shiryuu!</font>

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See that, you worms? When I'm not around, you can't do anything.</font>

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been doing a pretty damn lousy job here.</font>

12
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a horrible incident.</font>

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shame to Impel Down.</font>

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those three guys you're looking for freed Crocodile and Jinbei...</font>

15
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">before going up to Level Five through that hole.</font>

16
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Relay this message to Magellan at once: I'll lend him a hand.</font>

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

18
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crocodile and Jinbei?!</font>

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! They're not in their cells!</font>

21
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So that means, even though I had them sealed up inside Level Six, they've managed to escape?!</font>

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are five of them now, and they're all on Level Five?!</font>

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how it is!</font>

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think I'm responsible for this?</font>

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan is handing over Portgas D. Ace right now, so you'll probably have to take full responsibility.</font>

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Full Responsibility</i>?!</font>

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! I shall fight them as well!</font>

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send all troops to Level Four!</font>

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sadi-chan! Saldeath!</font>

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take all your men with you and head for Level Four!</font>

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will be an attempt to become Warden with your lives on the line!</font>

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I got it wrong! This will be a battle with your lives on the line!</font>

33
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are vyou ready?</font>

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if vwe DO make it to the entrance on the first floor,</font>

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the problem is what comes after vwe've made it outside.</font>

36
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe're surrounded by the impassable Calm Belt.</font>

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vwe're to cross it and reach Navy HQ, vwe have no choice but hijack one of the Navy's warships.</font>

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Numbers are absolutely essential!</font>

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe have to get more allies.</font>

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, right now only a handful of vyou will make it to the first floor without getting caught!</font>

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vwe are caught, gruesome torture awaits vus.</font>

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So listen up, in order to increase vour survival rate just a little bit,</font>

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">vwe'll have to free as many prisoners as vwe can between Level Five and Level One!</font>

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The more trouble the prisoners cause, the more enemy troops will be distracted by them!</font>

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe will steal as many keys and free as many prisoners as we can while making our way up there!</font>

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe are going to cause a riot here in Impel Down the likes of which has never been seen!</font>

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So let's go, Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

48
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gone ahead already.</font>

50
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He freed himself?!</font>

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe'll follow him immediately, Candies!</font>

52
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Will someone please stop me?!</font>

53
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So fast! So fast! I'm spinning even faster than ever!</font>

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Tension Hormones were too effective!</font>

55
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. But that's actually pretty convenient, isn't it?</font>

56
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it isn't!</font>

57
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost ten in the morning right now!</font>

58
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The execution will take place at three this afternoon!</font>

59
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're certain to carry out the execution at that exact moment!</font>

60
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Whitebeard intends to stop them, he should attack several hours before the execution!</font>

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-san is already being taken across the sea.</font>

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The battle could break out any minute now!</font>

63
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They won't kill him before three o'clock, right?!</font>

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we still have a chance!</font>

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These doors are completely pointless.</font>

66
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll dry it up with my right hand.</font>

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Explanation of Crocodile's Suna Suna Fruit powers.</font>

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Suna: Sand</i></font>

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is a sand man who can turn into and manipulate sand.</font>

70
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The palm of his right hand can absorb the moisture from anything.</font>

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When touched by his hand, people and plants will dehydrate, while earth and stone will crumble to sand.</font>

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they are!</font>

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is Level Four!</font>

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners that escaped from Level Six, the Warlord Jinbei...</font>

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inferno Hell, huh?</font>

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The intruder, Monkey D. Luffy...</font>

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

78
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The former Warlord, Crocodile...</font>

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all here!</font>

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Start counterattack!</font>

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

82
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Morons! Use the prison bullets!</font>

83
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crescent Sand Dune!</font>

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shoot him! Use the prison-bullets!</font>

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

86
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arabesque Tile Fist!</font>

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-There's no way we can win!</font>

91
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a rookie with a 300 million beli bounty, and he's got <i>two</i> Warlords with him!</font>

92
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Don't falter!</font>

93
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll just have to hold them back with our sheer numbers until the reinforcements arrive!</font>

94
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it. I'm in a hurry.</font>

95
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go.</font>

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn them... Shoot!</font>

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,880
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Beast Hell</font>

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,480

99
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is all that noise?</font>

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,760

103
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, proceed to Level Four.</font>

104
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I just heard something from the speakers...</font>

105
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has something happened in the prison?</font>

106
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Buggy! Look!</font>

107
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards and the Blugori are leaving!</font>

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.</font>

109
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like there's some trouble on another floor, partner.</font>

110
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a great opportunity for us!</font>

111
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that's right...</font>

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I think back on it...</font>

113
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were chased by the Army-Wolves in Level Five...</font>

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And just moments ago, we were pressed against the floor trying to deceive those Accursed Beasts...</font>

115
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might have seemed like comic relief, but we've FINALLY made it back here to Level Two...!</font>

116
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're a breath closer to that long-awaited outside world...</font>

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ya ready, guys?</font>

118
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we are!</font>

119
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fake keys that Three-guy made out of wax...</font>

120
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is totally awesome!</font>

121
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, proceed to Level Four.</font>

122
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Sector A! What's happening?!</font>

123
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sector B, wait!</font>

124
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden! This is the monitoring room!</font>

125
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is strange...</font>

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no no... This cool hat, you see,</font>

128
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it is a specially-made headdress that I was going to wear to commemorate my promotion to Warden...</font>

129
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not talking about the thing on your head!</font>

130
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see someone sneaking around on Level Two!</font>

131
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like a couple of prisoners!</font>

132
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What</i>?!</font>

133
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, the keys! We're getting out of here!</font>

134
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot, you there!</font>

135
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Crocodile?!</font>

136
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm thinking of escaping this place, but I'll need some soldiers.</font>

137
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How 'bout it?</font>

138
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanna join me...</font>

139
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister One?</font>

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose I'll tag along, if it's with you.</font>

141
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was starting to get bored.</font>

142
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a ton.</font>

143
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Captain Buggy you should be thanking.</font>

144
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level Two guards, are you there?!</font>

145
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you are, then respond!</font>

146
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you guys doing?</font>

148
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, we're heading to Level Four, like we were ordered...</font>

149
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Stay and keep watch on that floor!</font>

150
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This floor?</font>

151
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things have turned to our favor, partner!</font>

152
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If these guys start rioting again, we can use that chance to smuggle ourselves onto a warship!</font>

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, and then our escape will be complete!</font>

154
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose Straw-Hat and Mister Two are already dead...</font>

155
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if they survived, they'll be stuck in prison for the rest of their lives!</font>

156
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our own lives are the most important thing!</font>

157
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So long, suckers!</font>

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Buggy the Clown!</font>

159
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up there! Look above you!</font>

160
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Above us...?</font>

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, men!</font>

162
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the best chance we'll ever get!</font>

163
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If ya wanna taste the fresh air again, raise hell like your lives depend on it!</font>

164
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the kick-off!</font>

165
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our savior!</font>

166
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Captain Buggy!</font>

167
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is Level Two...</font>

168
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners have escaped from their cages and are running wild again!</font>

169
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please send the Blugori back here!</font>

170
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't restrain them!</font>

171
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Level Four!</font>

172
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it now?!</font>

173
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Okama-queen Ivankov, Inazuma,</font>

174
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the guy you ran into earlier, Mister Two...!</font>

175
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit messing around!</font>

176
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've arrived, followed by a huge crowd of people!</font>

177
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A... A crowd?!</font>

178
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.</font>

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All troops, urgently proceed to Level Four.</font>

180
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the people they've brought with them are... You won't believe this!</font>

181
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're prisoners who have vanished over the years,
who we thought had been taken by the Demon's Tug!</font>

182
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?!</font>

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?!</font>

184
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe've finally made it!</font>

185
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan!</font>

186
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan!</font>

187
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got a tension boost, huh?</font>

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm unstoppable now!</font>

189
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here, Mister One?!</font>

190
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's this guy?</font>

191
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the guy who was beaten by
Waistband-chan back in Alabasta!</font>

192
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Someone I don't know, then.</font>

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden! Hurry and send reinforcements to Level Four!</font>

194
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level Two, as well!</font>

195
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do I do...?</font>

196
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Face-Growth Hormone!</font>

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too hot!</font>

198
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell Wink!</font>

199
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

200
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't stop them!</font>

201
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All these prisoners, who were really ferocious before they disappeared,</font>

202
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are all wearing some kinda weird, fanatical getups!</font>

203
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're unstoppable in more ways than one!</font>

204
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go to Navy HQ!</font>

205
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like an unprecedented riot is taking place in Impel Down.</font>

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their leader is Monkey D. Luffy.</font>

207
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a good look at the sky. It's the last time you'll see it.</font>

208
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you've been secured on to the execution platform,</font>

209
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you'll never...</font>

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">see the sky again.</font>

211
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Onigumo.</font>

212
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare to open the gates to Marineford.</font>

213
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleet Admiral Sengoku!</font>

214
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did it go?</font>

215
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's nowhere to be found!</font>

216
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's just over 5 hours left till Ace's execution.</font>

217
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no idea when Whitebeard might show up,</font>

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and now, even though we've entered the most critical time,</font>

219
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we can't find the Warlord Blackbeard anywhere on the island, no matter how hard we look!</font>

220
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And one more thing...</font>

221
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A warship that didn't get clearance to leave...</font>

222
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just arrived at Impel Down!</font>

223
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't suppose...</font>

225
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait here!</font>

226
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't call for any outside reinforcements,</font>

227
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and we're in a state of emergency and cannot take on this responsibility!</font>

228
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were just checking with HQ...</font>

229
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares about that? We're on the same side, ain't we?</font>

230
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Still! Pirates aren't allowed inside the prison, regardless of the circumstances!</font>

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No need to hold back.</font>

232
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm with the Government!</font>

233
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a depressing place this is!</font>

234
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporting in!</font>

235
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crew of the ship that Blackbeard arrived on...</font>

236
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has been eliminated!</font>

237
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

238
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

239
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir!</font>

240
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you lot!</font>

241
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liberation!</font>

242
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got an intruder!</font>

243
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's one of the Seven Warlords, Marshall D. Teach!</font>

244
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hang in there!</font>

245
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys are the guards that were just wiped out!</font>

246
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darkness...!</font>

247
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard and his crew have broken in with hostile intent, no doubt about it!</font>

248
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was... pulled into the darkness...!</font>

249
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know what they're here for!</font>

250
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over! My life is over!</font>

251
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's not true.</font>

252
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the beginning.</font>

253
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the beginning of my dark, depressing life where I'm unable to become Warden.</font>

254
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden!</font>

255
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull yourself together!</font>

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy is on Level Four,</font>

257
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buggy the Clown is on Level Two,</font>

258
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the Warlord, Blackbeard, is at the main entrance!</font>

259
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What can I do about this?!</font>

260
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about going back to the monitoring room and eating some crackers?</font>

261
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull yourself together! We must protect Impel Down!</font>

262
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, you're not the one taking responsibility here, so <i>of course</i> you can say that...</font>

263
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me you're trying to take my job as Assistant Warden?!</font>

264
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal!</font>

265
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you hear me?</font>

266
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden Magellan, is that you?</font>

267
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where... Where are you now?</font>

268
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in Level Two.</font>

269
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've taken care of the imbeciles who were causing an uproar here.</font>

270
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

271
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help...!</font>

272
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've sealed all the exits to this floor.</font>

273
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be completely immobilized before long.</font>

274
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're trapped here!</font>

275
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Buggy! There's a clog of poison blocking the way!</font>

276
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, Magellan! You sneaky bastard!</font>

277
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be in big trouble at this rate!</font>

278
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea why Blackbeard has invaded this place,</font>

279
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I have a plan to deal with him.</font>

280
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a risky move, but as things stand now, we have no choice.</font>

281
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A risky move, is it?</font>

282
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I've decided that we must release Shiryuu!</font>

283
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Seriously</i> ?!</font>

284
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, we can't rely on
reinforcements from Navy HQ.</font>

285
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must pull through on our own, one way or another.</font>

286
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send all available troops to deal with the situation on Level Four.</font>

287
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be on Level Four shortly.</font>

288
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold tight until I get there!</font>

289
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden!</font>

290
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden!</font>

291
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay! Warden!</font>

292
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just hurry up and get moving.</font>

293
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,640
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down Head Jailer</font>

294
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,640
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Shiryuu of the Rain</font>

295
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shiryuu. Does it feel good being out of that cell?</font>

296
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I've learned my lesson.</font>

297
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was about to die from eternal boredom...</font>

298
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not just gonna use me then lock me up again, are you Magellan?</font>

299
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been sentenced to death.</font>

300
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an opportunity to postpone your sentence.</font>

301
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no second chance.</font>

302
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I see.</font>

303
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll keep that in mind.</font>

304
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your sword, Head Jailer Shiryuu.</font>

305
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll leave Blackbeard to you.</font>

306
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well.</font>

307
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My sword, eh?</font>

308
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time, no see...</font>

309
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So sorry...</font>

310
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For cutting you guys down.</font>

311
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the guards have been defeated!</font>

312
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've stolen the keys!</font>

313
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, keep building vour numbers, and let vus throw the prison into chaos!</font>

314
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way, the enemy can't hold vus back, and vwe'll increase vour chance of survival!</font>

315
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you wanna escape, get out of those cells!</font>

316
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your chance to escape!</font>

317
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go together!</font>

318
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're letting us out of here?</font>

319
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Blugori!</font>

320
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go wild!</font>

321
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, it's the Blugori!</font>

322
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head Guard Saldeath, we're counting on you!</font>

323
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blugori! Get that Okama with the humongous face!</font>

324
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not a huge face! It's vmy Face-Growth Hormones!</font>

325
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get him, Blugori!</font>

326
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell...</font>

327
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wink!</font>

328
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took out the Blugori army with one hit!</font>

329
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Impossible!</font>

330
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it! What is that?!</font>

331
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

332
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou don't have time to be standing around!</font>

333
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave vyour back to vus, and just keep running forward and climbing upward!</font>

334
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get going!</font>

335
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, gotcha.</font>

336
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

337
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Demon Guards!</font>

338
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's three of them!</font>

339
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, it's reinforcements!</font>

340
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sadi-chan and her team are here!</font>

341
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These kids won't...</font>

342
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">let you take a single step past this spot!</font>

343
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun, let us go! I will help you!</font>

344
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though I am not so good at fighting on land...</font>

345
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? You're pretty tough...</font>

346
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them, Demon Guards!</font>

347
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

348
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without its eyesight, even a Demon Guard
is useless as a tree stump.</font>

349
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them!</font>

350
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll crush them!</font>

351
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone attack at once!</font>

352
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pathetic weaklings...</font>

353
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use! They're too strong!</font>

354
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither guns nor cannons affect them!</font>

355
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help!</font>

356
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hopeless! Don't fight 'em! Pull back!</font>

357
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all gonna die!</font>

358
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys are worse than the Blugori! Run!</font>

359
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I just <i>love</i> the sound of your screams!</font>

360
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those Demon Guards are quite frightening, indeed!</font>

361
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Help us!</font>

362
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Third!</font>

363

364
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them, Demon Guards!</font>

365
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

370
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

371
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Raise the drawbridge!</font>

372
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them through!</font>

373
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

376
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's only five of 'em! Stop Blackbeard's crew!</font>

377
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire! Fire!</font>

378
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might be a member of the Warlords, but he's intentionally betraying us!</font>

379
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard is no longer our ally!</font>

380
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if he betrayed us? He was a pirate to begin with.</font>

381
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Head Jailer Shiryuu!</font>

382
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did you get out of the cell?</font>

383
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five enemies, eh?</font>

384
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that?</font>

385
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy looks dangerous...</font>

386
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that Magellan?</font>

387
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Marshall D. Teach... "Blackbeard", are you not?</font>

388
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right! And who're you?</font>

389
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

390
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They beat the Demon Guards! We can't stop them!</font>

391
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charge forward!</font>

392
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing to be afraid of!</font>

393
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Their numbers keep growing!</font>

394
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn-</font>!

395
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the leader of the Demon Guards, Sadi!</font>

396
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares?! Get her!</font>

397
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence! You will refer to me as Sadi-chan!</font>

401
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">do such a thing to my adorable...</font>

402

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait.</font>

405
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't Vi tell vyou to keep moving forward?!</font>

406
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Female Hormone!</font>

407
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make way, eccentric girl!</font>

408
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence! You're a female Ivankov, huh?</font>

409
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ambiguous anarchist!</font>

410
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now...</font>

411
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi feel like a woman.</font>

412
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! The staircase to Level Three is close!</font>

413
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will open the door!</font>

414
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's go!</font>

415
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? The door is opening itself!</font>

416
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares? We're in luck!</font>

417
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now let's go to Level Three!</font>

418
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the fortress of Hell!</font>

419
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shall not pass!</font>

420
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is this guy... Barging in here like he's so big?</font>

421
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal! He's the Assistant Warden of this prison!</font>

422
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

423
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold!</font>

424
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a thousand men guarding the stairs to Level Three,</font>

425
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all wielding bazookas loaded with special prison ammunition!</font>

426
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no escape for you!</font>

427
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To defend the bright future of the defenseless civilians...</font>

428
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, infamous, world-renowned pirate...</font>

429
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will carry out your sentence on the Warden's behalf!</font>

430
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His attitude is different from what we're used to...</font>

431
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it!</font>

432
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

433
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's serious!</font>

434
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we can count on him! He's really strong!</font>

435
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannya! Hannya!</font>

436
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

437
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know it!</font>

438
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Hannya Carnival!</font>

439
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inferno Hell Carriage!</font>

440
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're not gonna move, then I'll send you flying!</font>

441
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I <i>will</i> save Ace!</font>

442
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make me laugh!</font>

443
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you could send me flying so easily, I wouldn't be worthy of being Assistant Warden!</font>

444
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second!</font>

445
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

446
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet...</font>

447
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

448
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been waiting for you...</font>

449
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan! Please hurry!</font>

450
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are the ones leading the riot?</font>

451
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're right in front of the stairs to Level Three.</font>

452
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stairs leading from floor to floor are pretty far apart. Let's hurry!</font>

453
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just barely managing to hold them back with the help of Assistant Warden Hannyabal!</font>

454
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden!</font>

455
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me!</font>

456
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not...</font>

457
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>LET YOU PASS</i> !</font>

458
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow the Assistant Warden's lead! Keep fighting!</font>

459
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">FINE BY US!</font>

460
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was nothing! I can still fight!</font>

461
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">GET OUT OF MY WAY!</font>

462
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I will not let you pass!</font>

463
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

464
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Stamp!</font>

465
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

466
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get in my way!</font>

467
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I have to hurry, or Ace will...!</font>

468
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, you're gonna save your brother?!</font>

469
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try to glorify the trash of society!</font>

470
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You pirates and rebels gained your reputations outside by committing crimes!</font>

471
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden Hannyabal!</font>

472
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just stay down! You'll die!</font>

473
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Civilians can't sleep at night...</font>

474
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">fearing that their loved ones will lose their lives, and it's all because you scum dare to sail the seas!</font>

475
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that is why we imprison the most dangerous criminals around the world...</font>

476
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To make sure that the defenseless civilians can rest easy!</font>

477
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the fortress of Hell!</font>

478
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it were to fall, the whole world would descend into the depths of fear!</font>

479
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said I wouldn't let you pass, so
you're not taking a single step past me!</font>

480
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden...!</font>

481
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace is important to me! So move it!</font>

482
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't reason with such a fool...</font>

483
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Assistant Warden! Help us!</font>

484
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! What happened to you?!</font>

485
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give it up!</font>

486
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go around spouting that crap about "Justice" or "Evil"!</font>

487
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can look all over the world,</font>

488
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you'll <i>never</i> find an answer!</font>

489
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ridiculous!</font>

490
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's that guy I met in Jaya!</font>

491
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, this sure is quite an impressive group.</font>

492
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've walked in on a pretty major incident, huh?</font>

493
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Teach! What are you doing here?!</font>

494
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or I suppose I should call you Blackbeard now?</font>

495
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei...</font>

496
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, no need to be so violent. Mind loosening that fist of yours?</font>

497
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, I heard you and Ace were good friends, huh?</font>

498
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm not the one you should be blaming here.</font>

499
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?!</font>

500
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm chasing after a certain man.</i></font>

501
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He calls himself Blackbeard.</i></font>

502
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>People's dreams...</i></font>

503
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>will never end!!</i></font>

504
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I heard that a pirate called Blackbeard...</i></font>

505
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>managed to join the Warlords by capturing Fire Fist Ace.</i></font>

506
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Blackbeard...</i></font>

507
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,730

508
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're...</font>

509
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?!</font>

510
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Oh, yeah, I never introduced myself, did I?</font>

511
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time no see, Straw Hat!</font>

512
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure was surprised when I heard that you were Commander Ace's little brother!</font>

513
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shouldn't you be there?</font>

514
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gonna start soon, ya know?</font>

515
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your brother's execution, that is!</font>
