51
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She went to the pool with Kokoro-san.</font>

52
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pool?</font>

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you guys went over that mountain to enter the Grand Line too right?</font>

57
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, no.</font>

58
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't pass over Reverse Mountain.</font>

59
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At headquarters, they have ships that are able to move through the calm belt-</font>

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!? That's unfair!</font>

61
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, they aren't 100% perfect though.</font>

62
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But how!?</font>

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are Sea Kings there that are bigger than battleships!</font>

64
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They really messed us up!</font>

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, the undersides of the ship are covered in a rock known as sea-stone.</font>

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what about it?</font>

67
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you see,</font>

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sea-stone puts out the same kind of energy as the sea,</font>

69
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So to all the fish in the ocean the ship seems-</font>

70
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea's energy?</font>

71
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's it!</font>

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That way even if they move through the creatures' homes</font>

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sea Kings won't even notice the ship's presence!</font>

74
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That way even if they didn't take the entrance at Reverse Mountain,</font>

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They could still enter the Grand Line at will.</font>

76
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected of the Marine scientists.</font>

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got some good information.</font>

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big sis, big sis!</font>

79
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you gonna swim?</font>

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

81
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet for a second Chimney!</font>

82
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a rare chance!</font>

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate big sis's so selfish!</font>

84
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm spying right now!</font>

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that something you're supposed to yell?</font>

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The person responsible for this groundbreaking research is most certainly the marine's scientist...</font>

87
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dr. Vegapunk.</font>

88
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's amazing.</font>

89
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, he truly is amazing.</font>

90
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, that devil fruit you ate,</font>

91
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the one who identified the power it contained.</font>

92
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he invented the new technology which allows objects to consume devil fruits.</font>

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that's just in the last few years!</font>

94
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dr. Vegapunk...</font>

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm, he seems pretty amazing.</font>

96
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, this world is full of amazing people!</font>

97
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I hadn't met Luffy-san back then, I wonder what a small world I would live in.</font>

98
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You made me aware of this sea.</font>

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That day, if you hadn't come bursting out from that barrel...</font>

100
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would certainly still be stuck at work on Alvida's ship.</font>

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

102
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were on Alvida's ship weren't you?</font>

103
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't that hilarious?</font>

104
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason why you got on that ship in the first place!</font>

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What now?</font>

106
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't heard this story.</font>

107
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're truly grateful.</font>

108
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why we want to try and repay Vice-Admiral Garp by-</font>

109
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

110
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna show him what it's like in our shoes.</font>

111
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that sounds good you evil-idiot!</font>

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?!</font>

113
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Are you really going back already?</font>

114
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat with us! Eat!</font>

115
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really enemies...</font>

116
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't act friendly together.</font>

117
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!</font>

118
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know what the second half of the Grand Line is known as?</font>

119
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Further beyond the Red Line, the sea becomes more vast.</font>

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That final sea, people call it by one more name...</font>

121
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New World.</font>

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New World.</font>

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea where those who wish to usher in a new era gather!</font>

124
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who controlled that sea was...</font>

126

127
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will certainly meet again there!</font>

128
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And next time I'll capture you!</font>

129
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll become even stronger!</font>

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One day, in the Navy, I'll...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll...</font>

132
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Become a Navy Admiral!</font>

133
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

134

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, I just got carried away.</font>

136
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm embarrassed, just saying I want to become that.</font>

137
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've just felt kind of inspired since we found you and-</font>

138
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coby!</font>

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna fight me, right?</font>

140
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then of course you'll become that strong!</font>

141
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What else?</font>

142
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But an admiral?</font>

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next time we meet, we'll be even stronger.</font>

144
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even more amazing!</font>

145
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

146
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a wavering dream I blurted out but...</font>

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he able to believe me wholeheartedly?</font>

148
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

149
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still a crybaby, Coby?</font>

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That I was able to meet you two again today...</font>

151
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm truly grateful!</font>

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It truly will be a challenge to go after these two!</font>

153
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to keep becoming even stronger!</font>

154
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in the New World we'll meet again!</font>

155
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

156
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, hey!</font>

157
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two better prepare yourselves!</font>

158
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got the guts to surpass you!</font>

159
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait up!</font>

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

161
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one can stop us now!</font>

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?</font>

163
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've lost your mind!</font>

164
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:26,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you've made yourself another unbelieveable opponent, haven't you?</font>

165
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coby's a capable guy. I just knew that.</font>

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

167
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The water-water meat is done!</font>

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandma, you're amazing!</font>

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sure smells good!</font>

171
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't it?</font>

172
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, say 'aaaah'.</font>

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Delicious!</font>

174
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Delicious!</font>

175
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Water-water meat barbeque!</font>

176
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sogeking!</font>

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did you-</font>

178
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, eat as much as you like!</font>

179
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you crying?</font>

180
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

181
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The smoke just got in my eyes is all.</font>

182
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is it, Robin-chwan~?</font>

183
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Different from the stocked foods isn't it?</font>

184
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it's delicious.</font>

185
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's them!</font>

186
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san!</font>

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you finally woken up?</font>

188
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, the Franky family!</font>

189
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come and eat!</font>

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a barbeque!</font>

191
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My favorite!</font>

192
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, there's a ton of us, we need to get more meat!</font>

193
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Sodom and Gomorrah!</font>

194
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm starving.</font>

195
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too.</font>

196
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The giants! Heey!</font>

197
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

198
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were awake?!</font>

199
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Galley-La Company!</font>

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing at the pool...</font>

201
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you shameless girl!</font>

202
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a pool, you know.</font>

203
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gaah, something smells good.</font>

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iceburg-san!</font>

205
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I absolutely can't let you see this, this woman is some kind of pervert!</font>

206
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on there!</font>

207
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't take a break when building a ship.</font>

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! So we're gonna take that moment right now!</font>

209
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're got room for me too right?</font>

210
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right? Right?</font>

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were waiting on you Brother!</font>

212
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's begin!</font>

213
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Number One: Sogeking!</font>

214
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll sing!</font>

215
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! It's a party!</font>

216
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>On the Island of Snipers,</i></font>

217
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>I was born.</i></font>

218
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen from there, Nico Robin.</font>

219
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be...</font>

220
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aokiji?</font>

221
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you escape like always?</font>

222
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should have been able to escape from CP9 if you were alone.</font>

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's because this time was different.</font>

224
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To just let them be killed,</font>

225
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't do that.</font>

226
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The giant that fought for Ohara
20 years ago, Jaguar D. Saul...</font>

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was my close friend.</font>

228
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:39,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That day I respected his wishes, and spared your life.</font>

229
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Therefore I feel I have a responsibility to watch how your life turns out.</font>

230
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But after twenty years without a place of your own,</font>

231
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I felt it was to risky to let such a dangerous bomb continue to roam freely.</font>

232
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly, I felt that you finally had to die.</font>

233
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I wanted to finally finish off with what had happened at Ohara.</font>

234
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, there was no way I could have expected the CP9 to be defeated.</font>

235
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you finally found your place?</font>

236
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

237
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What Saul told you, whether it was wrong or right...</font>

238
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From here on, will you show me that answer?</font>

239
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I intend to.</font>

240
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, live strong.</font>

241
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ohara is not yet forgotten.</font>

242
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aokiji!</font>

243
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Robin!</font>

244
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look over here!</font>

245
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin! Over here!</font>

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

247
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much meat can you eat?</font>

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the greatest Luffy!</font>

249
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, try and have some manners.</font>

250
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were just stuffing yourself a second ago.</font>

251
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna try?</font>

252
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

253
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Robin!</font>

254
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, over here.</font>

255
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe I should try too?</font>

256
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, do it Robin!</font>

257
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop, Robin-chwan!</font>

258
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She hasn't done anything yet...</font>

259
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five Elders!</font>

260
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five Elders, something terrible has happened!</font>

261
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

262
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the New World, the fleet we sent a few days ago was defeated.</font>

263
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emperor "Red Hair" Shanks and Emperor "Whitebeard" Edward Newgate,</font>

264
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have finally made direct contact!</font>

265
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

266
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man!</font>

267
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man!</font>

268
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Red Hair wants to have a meeting with you.</font>

269
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, show him in.</font>

270
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the brat has better got some good booze with him.</font>

271
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it true the whole fleet was defeated?</font>

272
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it is said.</font>

273
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have Red Hair and Whitebeard come in contact?</font>

274
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Attention!</font>

275
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up!</font>

276
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what will happen from here on.</font>

277
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay on strict guard and await orders!</font>

278
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yessir!</font>

279
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease the course!</font>

280
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rise the sails!</font>

281
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

282
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're receiving Red Hair.</font>

283
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he comes... Red Hair.</font>

284
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You weaklings better stay back.</font>

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't handle it.</font>

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does that mean?</font>

287
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nevermind that, just go inside.</font>

288
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

289
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?</font>

290
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's already too late.</font>

291
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't panic, they're just unconscious.</font>

292
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're half-prepared, you won't be able to hold your senses before that man.</font>

293
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always...</font>

294
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an insane Haki.</font>

295
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Haki: Ambition</i></font>

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me.</font>

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to be a little threat since it's an enemy ship.</font>

298
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just seeing your face makes the wound given by that bastard ache again.</font>

299
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've brought some healing water, I've got no intention to fight.</font>

300
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something I want to talk with you about.</font>

301
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that comes from the one who just showed off their Haki?</font>

302
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot.</font>

303
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Red Hair!</font>

304
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, look at what you did!</font>

305
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! If it isn't the first division commander, Marco?</font>

306
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Won't you join my crew?</font>

307
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

308
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man, should we...?</font>

309
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, doesn't look like he wants a fight.</font>

310
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave us alone.</font>

311
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">West Blue liquor, this won't do.</font>

312
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From all of the seas I've been in, there's no liquor that surpasses this water's skin healing properties.</font>

313
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's liquor from my hometown.</font>

314
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, drink it.</font>

315
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not bad...</font>

316
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger,</font>

317
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Garp,</font>

318
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sengoku...</font>

319
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only a few of those who knew the seas back then remain.</font>

320
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been 22 years, it's only natural.</font>

321
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've also climbed the ladder...</font>

322
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were just an apprentice on Gol D. Roger's ship.</font>

323
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were pretty good on Roger's ship,</font>

324
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With that weird faced partner of yours.</font>

325
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Here we come, Whitebeard!</i></font>

326
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I hope you're prepared!</i></font>

327
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll rip off that beard of yours!</i></font>

328
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who're you calling red nose?!</i></font>

329
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was always with you.</font>

330
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has that funny red nose died?</font>

331
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buggy?</font>

332
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That takes me back...</font>

333
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The day of the captain's execution, we went our separate ways in Loguetown.</font>

334
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Come with me, Buggy!</i></font>

335
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Like I'm gonna be your subordinate, idiot!</i></font>

336
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard rumors that he's still a pirate.</font>

337
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like it was just yesterday to me.</font>

338
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are just a few of the ones who became legends.</font>

339
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The daily duels between you and Hawk-Eyes still sound new in my ears.</font>

340
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When a man like you return from East Blue with a lost arm, anyone would be surprised.</font>

341
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of enemy did you give it to?</font>

342
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That left arm of yours.</font>

343
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This...</font>

344
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I wouldn't have taken you with me anyway.</i></font>

345
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As if you could ever become a pirate.</i></font>

346
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I will!</i></font>

347
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Someday I will find crewmates who will beat to this crew.</i></font>

348
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll find the greatest treasure in the world.</i></font>

349
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And I'll definitely become the Pirate King!</i></font>

350
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I made a bet...</font>

351
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...on the New Age.</font>

352
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if it was worth it, then fine.</font>

353
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard.</font>

354
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been through numerous battles, and received many wounds, but...</font>

355
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, the one that aches...</font>

356
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...is this wound.</font>

357
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This one isn't one I got from an adventure, nor received from Hawk-Eyes.</font>

358
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who gave me this, was one of yours...</font>

359
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard, Teach!</font>

360
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like I was being careless.</font>

361
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you see what I'm trying to say?</font>

362
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard.</font>

363
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was quietly waiting for a chance.</font>

364
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't take the title of commander to be renowned.</font>

365
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted to conceal himself.</font>

366
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up until now he remained hidden under the shadow of the name of Whitebeard.</font>

367
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in order to gain power, he made his move.</font>

368
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end, he aims to get to the top,</font>

369
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With his own will.</font>

370
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might even come to steal your title.</font>

371
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want me to do?</font>

372
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the main question.</font>

373
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop Ace!</font>

374
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he's young, your 2nd division crew commander is a man of trust.</font>

375
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace is strong, I know that.</font>

376
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, that fame and trust can twist things.</font>

377
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the time for those two to fight yet!</font>

378
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave your hands off Blackbeard Teach.</font>

379
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's my only request.</font>

380
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The old man is laughing.</font>

381
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's like the way of talking of that funny nose.</font>

382
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His crime is... something that should never be done on a pirate ship, murder of another crewmate!</font>

383
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He broke the iron rule.</font>

384
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since the time he got on my ship, no matter how stupid he was, he became my son.</font>

385
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where does the soul of a murdered son go to?</font>

386
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to show that man that you can't cross this world without morals!</font>

387
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my responsibility to show Teach of his foolishness!</font>

388
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you got it, moron?</font>

389
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a hundred years too soon to instruct me!</font>

390
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one could have stopped this...</font>

391
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rampaging point of this age!</font>

392
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not enough to scare me!</font>

393
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am Whitebeard!</font>

394
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That red haired bastard! What's he doing to the old man?!</font>

395
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just take it easy.</font>

396
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't the type of man that does stupid things.</font>

397
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, it seems something went wrong in the conversation.</font>

398
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look in the sky.</font>

399
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The clouds...</font>

400
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, the sky has been split in two!</font>

401
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother, isn't that Iceburg?</font>

402
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it?</font>

403
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really going at it, Franky.</font>

404
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, why did you come?</font>

405
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gaah, what about it?</font>

406
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't I give you a hand?</font>

407
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, did you come to interfere with my plan?</font>

408
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been doing nothing but dismantling; aren't your skills dulled?</font>

409
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show me your blueprints.</font>

410
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of Tom's Workers are present...</font>

411
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we have to build a ship in this empty place.</font>

412
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is for the Straw Hats!</font>

413
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should we give you a hand?!</font>

414
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Taking care of such a rushed job alone has gotta be rough.</font>

415
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it okay that you do it here instead of in town?</font>

416
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're building a replacement for that burnt ship,</font>

417
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the employees had to come and lend a hand, no matter what.</font>

418
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

419
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every single one of you...!</font>

420
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such good guys they are.</font>

421
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are.</font>

422
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better not slack off!</font>

423
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Let's show them what the 1st Dock is capable of!</font>

424
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

425
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

426
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's today's newspaper!</font>

427
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It shows the events at Enies Lobby.</font>

428
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It finally came!</font>

429
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What's written about it?</font>

430
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an article that could decide our fates!</font>

431
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... that...</font>

432
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That...</font>

433
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">About us...</font>

434
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing recorded.</font>

435
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Really?!</font>

436
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not at all?</font>

437
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no mistake!</font>

438
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we were preparing for a permanent fugitive life!</font>

439
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank God!</font>

440
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an unexpected thing to do.</font>

441
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, take a look!</font>

442
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an article about Straw Hat!</font>

443
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems he took down the judiciary island.</font>

444
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this, his bounty will definitely rise!</font>

445
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enies Lobby is famous for having the sea train running all the way from Water Seven.</font>

446
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not far from here.</font>

447
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We might get the chance to meet him again.</font>

448
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be within our firing range...</font>

449
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How pitiful... an unlucky bunch they are...</font>

450
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Captain!</font>

451
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we're going!</font>

452
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, prepare to leave!</font>

453
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get delayed!</font>

454
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

455
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, Teach.</font>

456
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been looking for you.</font>

457
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does this mean?</font>

458
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all the trouble the Franky Family caused.</font>

459
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:17,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be that your grandpa didn't want to involve ordinary people and didn't report them?</font>

460
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... such a thing...</font>

461
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think not.</font>

462
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is surely Aokiji's doing...</font>

463
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an unpredictable man.</font>

464
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, I'm glad.</font>

465
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine for us, but for them to become fugitives would be quite unfortunate.</font>

466
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in their place, it says some awful things about what we did.</font>

467
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Declaration of War on the World Government".</font>

468
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They even blame us for burning the island.</font>

469
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this our bounties will rise.</font>

470
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Will I also get a bounty on my head?!</font>

471
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's very probable, but...</font>

472
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The most badass will be me.</font>

473
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"A Big Star Appears".</font>

474
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you getting excited for?!</font>

475
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky is building us a ship?!</font>

476
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, you were asleep, right?</font>

477
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay, this is great!</font>

478
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about that? He's a good guy after all!</font>

479
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of ship will it be? I'm looking forward to it!</font>

480
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">He was a nice guy, a nice guy...</font>

481
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then let's use the rest of the money to buy supplies.</font>

482
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, do you think the ship will be huge?</font>

483
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well since we got here I was wishing for more wide areas.</font>

484
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the 100 million beli that was here?</font>

485
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that was spent during the party, buying meat and booze.</font>

486
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spent...?</font>

487
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our money?!</font>

488
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't it for our party?</font>

489
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost nothing remains!</font>

490
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, of course!</font>

491
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost everyone in town stayed at that party to the very end.</font>

492
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sure was fun!</font>

493
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, since we'll get our ship, it doesn't matter anymore.</font>

494
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I thought of getting some wonderful furniture for the ship...</font>

495
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go to the canal to look for some.</font>

496
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Robin, since I'm out to play, can you lend me some money?</font>

497
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't take it anymore!</font>

498
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not getting anything!</font>

499
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood!</font>

500
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp?</font>

501
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

502
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you want me to come back now?</font>

503
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez, it can't be helped.</font>

504
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm not there, you can't do anything.</font>

505
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, since you insist, I'll come back to the crew.</font>

506
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe it's best if I say it this way.</font>

507
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the 23rd pattern...</font>

508
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chopper, we're having nice weather today.</font>

509
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go fishing!</font>

510
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy, what about you?</font>

511
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This one is also good.</font>

512
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The "act as if nothing ever happened" strategy.</font>

513
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or...</font>

514
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've decided to go to Elbaf!</font>

515
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Please don't go!</font>

516
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was kidding.</font>

517
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can understand your feelings.</font>

518
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you be coming back, Usopp?!</font>

519
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, idiot!</font>

520
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez, you guys sure love me!</font>

521
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he doing?</font>

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That idiot.</font>

523
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iceburg, you seem tired, how about some sleep?</font>

524
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would be you!</font>

525
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm beaten...</i></font>

526
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My body...is hot...</i></font>

527
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm still alive...</i></font>

528
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>At this rate... I will die...</i></font>

529
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No one's here.</i></font>

530
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>An abandoned scrapped ship.</i></font>

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Scrap...</i></font>

532
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Iron pieces...</i></font>

533
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A place which calms me down...</i></font>

534
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>First, if I don't do something about this unmoving body...</i></font>

535
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The log is set.</font>

536
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The log pose is pointing to the next island.</font>

537
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, all that's left is to get on the ship.</font>

538
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be fun!</font>

539
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, since it's going to be a surprise, he told us not to go and see it.</font>

540
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, if you follow that log, do you know where you will arrive?</font>

541
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, where?</font>

542
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems to be pointing down a little.</font>

543
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

544
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next island is...</font>

545
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bottom of the sea paradise,</font>

546
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fish-man Island.</font>

547
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">F-F-F-Fish-man Island?! At last?!</font>

548
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?! What's wrong, Sanji?!</font>

549
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fish-man Island?</font>

550
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How complicated...</font>

551
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, because of what happened in your village...</font>

552
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, that fish-man was a pirate, right?</font>

553
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's correct, you really did understand it, right, idiot?</font>

554
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you're stupid.</font>

555
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fish-man Island is a famous landmark on the Grand Line!</font>

556
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The world's most beautiful mermaids draw arcs in the sea.</font>

557
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dream kingdom where you can coexist with the fishes.</font>

558
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so?!</font>

559
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

560
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, can't we dream?</font>

561
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what we pirates do!</font>

562
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are young ones too!</font>

563
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, getting to the paradise isn't that simple.</font>

564
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried about this "bottom of the sea" concept, though...</font>

565
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll know once we go there.</font>

566
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The problem isn't there.</font>

567
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look at the most recent newspaper front page.</font>

568
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this...?</font>

569
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Once again this month, 14 ships have disappeared."</font>

570
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does this mean?</font>

571
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That triangular zone is...</font>

572
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Florian Triangle.</font>

573
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an area you're forced to pass through to get to the paradise.</font>

574
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every year over 100 ships disappear in that sea for unknown reasons...</font>

575
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, much later, the ships are found without any of the sailors.</font>

576
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are eyewitness reports of a ghost ship carrying those deceased ones who sailed in that sea.</font>

577
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghosts appear?! That's scary!</font>

578
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will we see living skeletons?!</font>

579
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you imagining?</font>

580
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

581
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I definitely don't want to encounter or see them!</font>

582
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such an awful ship!</font>

583
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could happen in that sea?</font>

584
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows...</font>

585
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything could happen there.</font>

586
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who enter that sea never come back, that's why I don't know...</font>

587
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a foggy, deep, dark sea...</font>

588
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful...</font>

589
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, before entering that extremely disastrous, dangerous sea, you better be firmly prepared.</font>

590
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghost ships that are mere shadows of what were once merchant ships or pirate ships...</font>

591
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are indispensable parts of the legends of treasure ships.</font>

592
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's search for the ghost ships!</font>

593
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!</font>

594
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?! I don't want to!</font>

595
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I intend to stock up with lots of provisions in case we have an accident, so don't worry.</font>

596
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A treasure ship?</font>

597
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There might be swords as well.</font>

598
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate bros!</font>

599
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

600
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need something?</font>

601
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother Franky told us to come and call for everyone!</font>

602
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The dream ship is complete!</font>

603
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks great!</font>

604
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it complete already?!</font>

605
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was fast!</font>

606
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The five top-notch shipwrights stayed up all night building it!</font>

607
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Building it!</font>

608
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Then let's go!</font>

609
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

610
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san!</font>

611
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san!</font>

612
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Franky family!</font>

613
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you guys?</font>

614
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're out of breath.</font>

615
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be honest, we just heard about it!</font>

616
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see the wanted posters?!</font>

617
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanted posters?</font>

618
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have been given an incredible bounty, Straw Hat-san!</font>

619
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, everyone else has one as well!</font>

620
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too?!</font>

621
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

622
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too?!</font>

623
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too?!</font>

624
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead of talking, see it for yourselves.</font>

625
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All seven of you now have bounties!</font>

638
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait.</font>

639
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What we're requesting, is this.</font>

640
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please look at this.</font>

641

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

644
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's terrible!</font>

645
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

646
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We somehow managed to avoid this, but Brother couldn't...</font>

647
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother's life will be in danger if he stays in Water Seven.</font>

648
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he gets caught this time, we won't have the power to save him!</font>

649
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surely, Brother must be worried about us and doesn't want to leave the island.</font>

650
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why we all came to talk with you...!</font>

651
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san, I beg of you!</font>

652
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it is against his own will, take Brother out to the sea!</font>

653
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man was the child of a pirate to begin with!</font>
