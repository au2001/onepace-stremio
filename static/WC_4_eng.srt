282
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! You were a soldier of the Neptune Army,

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to fight with us, the former slaves

284
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You became a warlord
to help advance the social status of us fishmen!</font>

285
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you allied with the Big Mom Pirates</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be fine without you.
Don't underestimate us!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't need to ask!</font>

If anything happens, take me with you!</font>

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,700

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No "but"! You should lose something too!</font>

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

353
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, spin it.</font>

354
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait to see what you're gonna lose!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="56"><i>Meanwhile, Luffy and the others are
sailing through Big Mom's territory.</i></font>

356
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So sweet!</font>

357
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, it's not moving a bit.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! What if those ants attack us again?!</font>

361
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When the sun rises,
it'll begin to flow again.</font>

362
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But during the night,
it gets cold and solidifies.</font>

363
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Share those things beforehand!</font>

364
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta melt it and get out
of this area of starch syrup!</font>

365
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

366
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull it!</font>

367
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just put the army of ants to sleep!</font>

368
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna be trouble when they wake up.</font>

369
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

370
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those sea ants once ate my ship.</font>

371
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my!</font>

372
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once? What did you come here for?</font>

373
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pedro used to be a pirate
along with Pekoms.</font>

374
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Really?!</font>

375
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so naive.</font>

376
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought of myself as an explorer,
but I became a wanted person.</font>

377
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I only accompanied Pekoms halfway.</font>

378
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I trust you people, so I can tell you.</font>

379
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was looking for poneglyphs
because I wanted to help Master Nekomamushi.</font>

380
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when I trespassed in Big Mom's territory,
it became my last voyage.</font>

381
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

382
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was defeated here once.</font>

383
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seldom told anyone about this.</font>

384
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know that.</font>

385
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have bad memories,
yet you came back?</font>

386
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If my experience helps you even a little bit
to take back Sanji, I'll be happy.</font>

387
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On top of that,</font>

388
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">maybe it wasn't so bad that I came along.</font>

389
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard our kings showed you people
the lode poneglyph at the Whale Tree.</font>

390
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They did.</font>

391
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was surprised.</font>

392
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you may have saved us,</font>

393
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they haven't shown it to anybody
other than the Kozuki clan...</font>

394
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for 26 years...</font>

395
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since they showed it to
Gol D. Roger's pirate group.</font>

396
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirate king?!</font>

397
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Later, Roger reached Laugh Tale
and was called the pirate king.</font>

398
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You people remind
Duke Inuarashi and Master Nekomamushi of them.</font>

399
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're expecting you to become
somebody who'll need the lode poneglyphs.</font>

400
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you gonna do after you defeat Kaido?</font>

401
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's too far ahead!
I haven't thought about it...</font>

402
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next, you'll need the lode poneglyph
that Big Mom has!</font>

403
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If so, this would be our biggest chance!</font>

404
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since we came this deep into her territory,</font>

405
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'd better steal Big Mom's lode poneglyph
in addition to taking back Sanji!</font>

406
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? But that's...</font>

407
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not just Sanji, but also a lode poneglyph?</font>

408
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Robin asked me to get it too,
but I wanna rescue Sanji first...</font>

409
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know.</font>

410
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get the lode poneglyph.
You guys go for Sanji.</font>

411
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

412
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we reach the island,
could I have a little time?</font>

413
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I'll get it!</font>

414
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, but if you're doing it for us,
we'll come with you!</font>

415
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you make sure to protect Sanji.</font>

416
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after you get him
back, things will be tough.</font>

417
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay. Then I'll leave it to you!</font>

418
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!</font>

419
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't decide so easily!</font>

420
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if Luffy-<i>san</i> was born to be lucky...</font>

421
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Brook?</font>

422
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing. I'm also lucky.</font>

423
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about? You're weird.</font>

424
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, the ants are awake!</font>

425
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

426
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"></font>

427
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come!</font>

428
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save the <i>Sunny<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

429
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,550
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45"><font color="#000000">The Next Day...</font></font></font>

430
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,550
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45">The Next Day...</font></font>

431
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, guys!</font>

432
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up!</font>

433
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What is it?</font>

434
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! Look!</font>

435
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here finally!</font>

436
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, it's gigantic!</font>

437
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is where an emperor lives!</font>

438
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a cake!</font>

439
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That tallest whole cake is a castle
where Big Mom lives.</font>

440
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A castle?!</font>

441
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-<i>san</i>, we'll continue
on straight like this?</font>

442
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that cape is
the only place without security.</font>

443
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

444
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the place Pudding-<i>san</i> mentioned.</font>

445
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we have to really thank her.</font>

446
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it weren't for her,
I don't know if we could've made it this far.</font>

447
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

448
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, somebody's there!</font>

449
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?</font>

450
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that Sanji?! Hey!</font>

451
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>
