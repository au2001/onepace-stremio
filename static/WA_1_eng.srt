00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even after he became a pirate,
he still cared about this island...</font>

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,040

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">for the rest of his life.</font>

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Even back then, he didn't have a family,

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This was his home nonetheless.</font>

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">After the Summit War...</font>

112
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">we at least tried to defend
the things that Pops was protecting</font>

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so we kicked off the Payback War against
Blackbeard as he invaded our territory.</font>

114
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But we were no match for Teach
and the power he got from Pops.</font>

115
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He took everything from us...</font>

116
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I wanted to beat the hell
out of that ingrate...</font>

117
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Pops was...</font>

118
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He was pretty stingy, wasn't he?</font>

119
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He often wanted others' drinks...</font>

120
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and never got any for us!</font>

121
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Since his entire share of our treasure
went back to this village...</font>

122
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We all knew it!</font>

123
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I see...</font>

124
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So, in essence, this village
acts as his final memento.</font>

125
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah...</font>

126
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,740

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Red Hair buried him nearby...</font>

128
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">By the way...</font>

129
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">there's a Warlord named Weevil
claiming he's Pops' biological son...</font>

130
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">who attacks people connected to Whitebeard.</font>

131
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, is that true?!</font>

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If we're talking about his love life,
one can't be certain...</font>

133
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">but I'd wager they're after his fortune.</font>

134
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">As if they'd take our word
for it that it doesn't exist.</font>

135
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I figure that sooner or later he'll
come after me and this place.</font>

136
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I see.</font>

137
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So you can't leave right <i>meow</i>.</font>

138
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Weevil's mother Buckin used to be a pirate.</font>

139
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I know that thirty or forty years ago,
she was on the same ship with Pops.</font>

140
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Then, maybe he's also a memento
that should be protected.</font>

141
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">His behavior sure would suggest otherwise!</font>

142
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're right!</font>

143
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you're going to see Straw Hat Luffy, I want
you to pass on a message, Nekomamushi.</font>

144
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, no problem.</font>

145
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You said you're headed to Wano?</font>

146
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yep.</font>

147
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you planning to do there?</font>

148
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We'll take down Kaido!</font>

149
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The Emperor... Kaido?!</font>

150
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy's going to pick a fight
with Kaido this time?!</font>

151
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,800
<font face="Roboto" size="59"><font color="#000000">At Sea, the New World</font></font>

152
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,800
<font face="Roboto" size="59">At Sea, the New World</font>

153
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy! It says the Reverie has begun!</font>

154
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Monarchs from all over the world are
attending the conference at Mary Geoise!</font>

155
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hmm...</font>

156
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">All eyes are on the Ryugu Kingdom</font>

157
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">since they're participating for
the first time in two centuries!</font>

158
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">King Neptune and his sons are there...!</font>

159
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And it looks like Shirahoshi was
applauded at the Red Port!</font>

160
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So she came up to the surface!
Wimpyhoshi is getting stronger!</font>

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,220
<font face="Roboto" size="59"><font color="#000000">Captain "Straw Hat" Luffy

<font face="Roboto" size="59">Captain "Straw Hat" Luffy
Straw Hat Pirates
Bounty: 1.5 Billion Belly</font>

163
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It seems like your grandpa was their escort.</font>

164
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh...?</font>

165
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They took a big step toward their dream
to relocate the Fishmen to the surface!</font>

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Vivi sweetie!</font>

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You became an even more beautiful princess!</font>

168
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And who could it be for?</font>

169
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Me?! Hey, is it for me?!</font>

170
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Move!</font>

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Vivi!</font>

172
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's Vivi!</font>

173
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's been forever since we last saw her!</font>

174
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's become a graceful and regal princess!</font>

175
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, so this is Vivi.</font>

176
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If we ever meet, I'd like to see her panties–</font>

177
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Like she'd show you!</font>

178
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, these are photos from the Unity Courtyard...</font>

179
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Look at all the royals who
attended with their bodyguards.</font>

180
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I-If Dressrosa is participating...</font>

181
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There she is! Viola my lovely!</font>

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Ugh! It's Wapol!</font>

183
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The acorn guy is there, too!</font>

184
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What? Wapol?! Did he make a comeback?!</font>

185
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Rebecca! Sai! We know so many of them!</font>

186
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Of course. Royals from all around the world
gather at the Reverie to discuss issues!</font>

187
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, maybe at the Reverie...</font>

188
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">At the Reverie, the princesses that I know...</font>

189
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">are getting worked up talking about me!</font>

190
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wouldn't that be nice?</font>

191
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, look at this, Chopper!</font>

192
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right here!</font>

193
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What is it, Chobro?</font>

194
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Doctorine!</font>

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, is she still alive?</font>

196
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey!</font>

197
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Doctorine...</font>

198
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! What are you doing, Chopper?!</font>

199
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't cut it out!</font>

200
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What? Wait!</font>

201
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Give me back my princesses!</font>

202
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What are you doing?!</font>

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! I haven't read the other
side yet! It's full of holes!</font>

204
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh? Is this an article about Kaido?</font>

205
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Big Mom... is what?! I can't even read it!</font>

206
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Sanji! Chopper! Give those back to me!</font>

207
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– No!
– No!</font>

208
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm glad everyone's doing great!</font>

209
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Once we sail around the world,
let's visit them again!</font>

210
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yes! All in good order!</font>

211
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Anyway, Luffy, the transponder snail
still won't connect?</font>

212
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, I forgot.</font>

213
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! This is Luffy! Come in!</font>

214
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There's no response.</font>

215
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Whatever. Let's push on!</font>

216
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wait, Luffy!</font>

217
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's wrong?</font>

218
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The wind...</font>

219
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The chill on the wind... and I've
never seen waves like these...</font>

220
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This can only spell trouble.</font>

221
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So this is the sea that surrounds Wano!</font>

222
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The wind is getting stronger as we draw closer,
and the waves are getting bigger!</font>

223
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It doesn't look like a normal
wind-driven current. The way it swells...</font>

224
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In addition to the unusual current...</font>

225
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Look! That's some nasty weather!</font>

226
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We'll want to avoid the storm...
Shall we wait it out?</font>

227
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! What are you talking about,
Brook?! Let's go to Wano <i>now</i>!</font>

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy, why would you put your
crew in such obvious danger?</font>

229
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Y'know, Brook...</font>

230
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Kin'emon actually warned me about this...</font>

231
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>Allow me to elaborate through this snail device.</i></font>

232
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>All the waters surrounding Wano are plagued
by terrible weather with no end.</i></font>

233
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>The sea is rough and the current is strong...</i></font>

234
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>making entry into the country an ordeal!</i></font>

235
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! The weather is always this bad?!
Then should we just go?!</font>

236
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's what I'm saying. Let's go!</font>

237
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Not only does it have strong samurai
but it's also perilous to enter...</font>

238
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It truly is an isolated country!</font>

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let me think a little... There must
be a way to get through safely...</font>

240
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What <i>is</i> that thing?!</font>

241
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's an octopus!</font>

242
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A giant one!</font>

243
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why's an octopus here?!</font>

244
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We're at sea! Octopuses live here!</font>

245
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I know that, but...!</font>

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">When did it come on board?!</font>

247
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! We're getting closer to Wano!</font>

248
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

249
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Who cares?! Go, <i>Sunny</i>!</font>

250
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">To Wano!</font>

251
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! Something's coming our way!</font>

252
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! What is it?!</font>

253
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It looks like a giant fish!</font>

254
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is it a shark?!</font>

255
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A shark?!</font>

256
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh no! It's coming!</font>

257
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">K-Koi...</font>

258
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh my, oh my!</font>

259
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's a massive koi!</font>

260
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's a school of koi?!</font>

261
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why are there koi in the sea?!</font>

262
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">They're freshwater fish!
How can they survive here?!</font>

263
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Like it matters when we're
dealing with monster koi!</font>

264
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, Sanji! Are they tasty?</font>

265
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Forget about those monsters!</font>

266
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well, alternating between baths of
hot and cold water firms them up,</font>

267
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">resulting in a delicacy called <i>arai</i>.</font>

268
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Simmering in miso makes <i>koikoku</i>.</font>

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Prepared as tempura or boiled in
salty-sweet sauce is also good.</font>

270
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright!</font>

271
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It'll be a banquet once we see
Zoro and the others again!</font>

272
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't, Luffy!</font>

273
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Koi have a lot of tiny bones!</font>

274
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Who cares?! How is that even
important right now?!</font>

275
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't fight back!</font>

276
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Of course it fights back!
Why don't you ever learn?!</font>

277
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Sanji! You got Luffy all riled up,
so <i>you</i> need to bring him back!</font>

278
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't worry, Nami. He'll be fine.</font>

279
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

280
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We need to protect the ship instead!</font>

281
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The wind is strong! Carrot, furl the sail!</font>

282
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Okay!</font>

283
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll help!</font>

284
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Look how clear the water is!
It's like the water of a mountain river!</font>

285
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'd prefer it if the water was not-so-clear!
The giant fish are scaring me!</font>

286
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! Wait, does that mean this is a river?</font>

287
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Where are these koi heading?!</font>

288
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hang on tight! We're going with the flow!</font>

289
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is Luffy still around here?!</font>

290
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

291
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Whoa-whoa...! What is that?!</font>

292
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The river's flowing to the bottom of
the waterfall! How's that possible?!</font>

293
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I got it!</font>

294
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If these falls are the reason it's fresh water,
then a massive source is up there!</font>

295
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Meaning, the country of Wano is up there?!</font>

296
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Up there...</font>

297
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! Whaaat?! How is that possible?!</font>

298
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh! Look at that!</font>

299
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The koi are climbing up the waterfall!</font>

300
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why?!</font>

301
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Holy carp! Those koi are cool!</font>

302
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A sailing ship can't do that!
We'll sink under the waterfall!</font>

303
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've got that right!</font>

304
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy!</font>

305
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wow, those are some tough koi!</font>

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">This is no time for that!</font>

307
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy! She says this ship's gonna sink!</font>

308
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Okay, I've got this!</font>

309
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

310
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hang on tight!</font>

311
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm counting on you, koi!</font>

312
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You've got to be kidding!</font>

313
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Go!</font>

314
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Alright!</font>

315
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Up we go!</font>

316
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's wrong with the sea around Wano?!</font>

317
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's so chaotic!</font>

318
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! There's the shore!</font>

319
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">– It's a whirlpool!
– It's a whirlpool!</font>

320
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Luffy! Let go of those koi!</font>

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No! They're my dinner!</font>

322
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Enough already!</font>

323
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Brook! Take the helm!</font>

324
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Okay!</font>

325
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's no good! The current is too strong!</font>

326
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Damn! We're almost there!</font>

327
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We're not gonna make it this time...</font>

328
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Doctorine!</font>

329
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey? Where are my koi?</font>

330
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's not important now!</font>

331
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?</font>

332
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh no! The whirlpool's got us!</font>
