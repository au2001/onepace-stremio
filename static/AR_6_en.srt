00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I dunno, but it doesn't look good!</font>

126
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:15,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

127
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Pinwheel!</font>

128
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I didn't come here to 
take on these guys!</font>

129
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The one I wanna beat up...</font>

130
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">is you!</font>

131
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's perfect, then.</font>

132
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I was just now thinking of killing you{ now}.</font>

133
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That was dangerous, you moron! {.}</font>

134
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you trying to kill us, too?!</font>

135
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What {destructive}incredible power!</font>

136
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I {can't}wouldn't have believed that any human {exists
who can}could throw that giant beast!</font>

137
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is this {battle of this world}fight some kind of dream?</font>

138
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare you hurt our brothers!</font>

139
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It would seem we need to fight, too.</font>

140
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Looks like we need to teach them
the differences between our {species}races.</font>

141
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The main forces finally show up, huh?</font>

142
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong{-san}, please {stay there quietly}just relax.</font>

143
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you {go on a mad rampage}lose your temper,
you'll {tear all of}lay waste to Arlong Park{ into pieces}.</font>

144
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We'll take care of these guys!</font>

145
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Yeah}Alright, do as you wish.</font>

146
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yikes!</font>

147
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey. Hey, {there}guys. 
There's something I...</font>

148
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That octopus is up to something.</font>

149
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Octopus is best boiled with a little salt and sliced up.</font>

150
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Add some olive oil and paprika, and 
it's a perfect snack while drinking.</font>

151
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, I'm kind of in trouble. 
Hear me out.</font>

152
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Take this! Zero vision!}See how you like having no vision!</font>

153

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Takohachi {Ink Jet}Black!</font>

154
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You idiot! Why didn't you dodge?!</font>

155
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't see!</font>

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now to finish you off!</font>

157
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Luffy! Run!</font>

158
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah, that's the problem.</font>

159
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't seem to move!</font>

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh?!</font>

161
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">M-My feet are stuck!</font>

162
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're the one who stuck 
them in the ground!</font>

163
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why {does he have to be so-}would he do that?!</font>

164
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Takohachi {Ink Jet}Black on the Rocks!</font>

165
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What a pain.</font>

166
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sanji! {Great!}That was amazing!</font>

167
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Seems I've wound up following
one hell of an idiot of a captain.</font>

168
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Agreed.</font>

169
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's... awesome!</font>

170
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But he's 100 times better than
{a}some damn gang that'd hurt a lady.</font>

171
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Lady?</font>

172
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{To think you'd}You're pretty crazy to bust in here
just for that one lousy girl.</font>

173
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Lousy girl?</font>

174
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just try and insult
Nami{-san} one more time.</font>

175
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll {use a buttered frying pan to 
turn you into meuniere, Fish Man!}panfry you in butter, monsieur fish fry!</font>

176
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You seem somewhat
skilled for a human.</font>

177
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Any sort of chivalry from a pirate
is {obviously}bound to be half-hearted.</font>

178
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go ahead and see if my chivalry 
is half-hearted or not.</font>

179
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I spent half my life
{was }raised by a{n unbeatable} tough-as-nails pirate{ for half my life}.</font>

180
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It appears you don't know the true 
{level}power of the fishman {species}race.</font>

181
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Oof! Oof!} {Dan: This should probably me removed, unless you want to make it "heave-ho" or something}</font>

182
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They're still really stuck.</font>

183
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Still?! They're still stuck?!</font>

184
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yep, they're still stuck.</font>

185
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I get the feeling just pulling
me won't get them unstuck.</font>

186
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you even trying?! Are you even
trying to {pull}get your legs out?!</font>

187
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh{at}y're they playing around here in Arlong Park{ for}?</font>

188
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll kill them!</font>

189
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, you! Get unstuck already!</font>

190
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get back here!</font>

191
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, octopus.</font>

192
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They're busy right now.</font>

193
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll take you on.</font>

194
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Roronoa Zoro! Yeah! I forgot!</font>

195
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare you trick me!</font>

196
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah! And you cut down
tons of my brothers!</font>

197
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm not interested 
in these old stories.</font>

198
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It doesn't matter what reasons
you have for wanting to kill me.</font>

199
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The situation's changed now!</font>

200
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're not trying to destroy us.</font>

201
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're trying to destroy you!</font>

202
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A-Alright, Zoro!
That octopus is all yours! Nice!</font>

203
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy!</font>

204
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm back.</font>

205
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why, you...</font>

206
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">My bad!</font>

207
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Seems you really do 
want me to kill you.</font>

208
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wasn't that the guy
who saved Gen{-san}?</font>

209
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're the people from 
Cocoyashi Village!</font>

210
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh?</font>

211
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Judging from the fact you have 
weapons, I take it this is a rebellion?</font>

212
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Then you're all–</font>

213
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Exploding Star!</font>

214
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Usopp!</font>

215
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{You're dealing with me!}I'm your opponent!</font>

216
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you wanna die that badly,
I'll {get rid of}finish you right now!</font>

217
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just who is that lad?</font>

218
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's brave one minute, then runs 
away the next. He's a baffling man.</font>

219
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get back here, {Nose}schnoz!</font>

220
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Well, you got a big mouth!</font>

221
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why are these people pirates?!</font>

222
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're all pathetic. Move.
I'm sick of watching this.</font>

223
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong{-san}! We asked you
not to go on a rampage!</font>

224
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I won't. I just thought up a fun game.</font>

225
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm {going to}gonna {beat}clobber you{ up}!</font>

226
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Do you really think you can beat us?</font>

227
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So what if we do?</font>

228
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We do, idiot! Let go!</font>

229
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sounds like he has something to say.</font>

230
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What the... What the...</font>

231
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">People with devil fruit
powers can't swim!</font>

232
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Though, even people without powers 
would sink in this situation!</font>

233
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's gonna throw him into the sea?!</font>

234
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gum-Gum Pistol!</font>

235
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oww!</font>

236
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You fool. {.}</font>

237
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Darn}Damn you!</font>

238
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How pointless.</font>

239
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy!</font>

240
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{Damn }You bastard!</font>

241
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm coming to save–</font>

242
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Idiot! Don't get worked up!</font>

243
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They want us to go in the water!</font>

244
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The fishmen would obviously have 
the advantage in an underwater fight!</font>

245
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's only one way to save Luffy!</font>

246
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take these guys down {in an instant}tout de suite,
then go into the water?</font>

247
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let's do it! There's no time!</font>

248
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah!</font>

249
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just how many seconds will 
the rubber man hold out?</font>

250
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, so that's the game?</font>

251
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,460

309
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No! If {many}a lot of us go and take time

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{and }It will just cause these people trouble, if anything.</font>

312
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It'll be pointless if we end up
{putting a crimp in}interfering with their fight.</font>

313

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So I'll do it alone.</font>

323
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Okay!</font>

324
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm sorry!</font>

325
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If only we were a little stronger...</font>

326
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Please save Big Bro!</font>

327
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You damn fish bastard!</font>

328
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Roronoa Zoro! Do you mind if I ask
you a question? You don't, right?</font>

329
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I heard you use three-sword style.</font>

330
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why are you using only one sword?</font>

331
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're already losing
{big}fairly badly with one sword!</font>

332
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sh-Shut up! I'm not {fighting}taking this seriously!</font>

333
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Actually, there's a reason that
a human swordsman can't defeat me.</font>

334
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wanna hear what it is?
You wanna hear it, right?</font>

335
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">When you hear it, you'll be
surprised, scared, blown away!</font>

336
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dammit! I can't be in pain right now!</font>

337
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">My fever's getting worse, too!</font>

338
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I thought it would come down
while I was moving around, but...</font>

339
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just as I thought, it's the wounds...</font>

340
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">from your fight with Hawk Eye{ are...}!</font>

341
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro!</font>

342
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What're you doing?</font>

343
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you trying to fake
an illness or something?</font>

344
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I won't fall for that. Roronoa Zoro!</font>

345
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just check out my true form!</font>

346
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Look! This is my true form!</font>

347
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here comes Hachi,
user of the six-sword style!</font>

348
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! That's not {where}when you're
supposed to fall! Don't mock me!</font>

349
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Ah! Big Bro!</font>

350
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So he was bearing the pain!</font>

351
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. His injuries would kill a normal person</font>

352
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">or leave them bedridden for half a year!</font>

353
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

354
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I thought something was strange.</font>

355
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He looked as if nothing had happened
right after that fierce fight.</font>

356
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is he an idiot or what?!</font>

357
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I thought I warned you 
to pay attention.</font>

358
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I have a 40th degree
in Fishman Karate.</font>

359
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What? Someone went flying?!</font>

360
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">B-Big Bro?!</font>

361
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Cook!</font>

362
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Ahh...</font>

363
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Cook!</font>

364
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's been taken care of, Arlong{-san}.</font>

365
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What do we do with Roronoa Zoro?</font>

366
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just ditch him in the sea.
What weaklings. How boring!</font>

367
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's all?</font>

368
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Geez, they sure did
a lot of damage, though.</font>

369
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's no big deal.</font>

370
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong Park can't be destroyed
by this kind of damage.</font>

371
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Indeed.</font>

372
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare you, Roronoa Zoro!</font>

373
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You died from shock before I, the 
great swordsman, could attack you?!</font>

374
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">History would have remembered you,
had you {died}fallen to my six-sword style.</font>

375
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Well, no matter how much you struggled,</font>

376
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">or even if the {world is turned upside down,}sun were to rise in the west,</font>

377
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">{you humans can't even give a 
scratch to}no human could ever lay a hand on me, the wielder of six swords!</font>

378
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop it, Hachi. I know how you feel,</font>

379
