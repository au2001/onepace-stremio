00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in the way!</font>

135
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stopping them is not gonna be easy.</font>

136
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they're gonna be like that, they're forcing our hands.</font>

137
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha, give us the candy!</font>

138
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you can't! I can't give this to you!</font>

139
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

140
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad candy!</font>

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

142
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull yourselves together!</font>

143
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We asked Chopper-chan to save us!</font>

144
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give it!</font>

145
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

146
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't listen to them, we won't be able to go home!</font>

147
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That won't work. Run away! Now, Mocha!</font>

148
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait! Hogging it is unfair!</font>

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get her!</font>

150
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Are you going to keep it all for yourself?!</font>

151
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

152
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The exit's sealed.</font>

154
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that chick?</font>

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's her!</font>

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, see?! It's the bird-lady I told you about!</font>

157
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,730

158
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Split it up and share with everyone.</font>

<font face="impress bt" size="45">Building D - SAD Manufacturing Room</font>

160
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,290

161
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,130

163
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a message from Joker.</font>

164
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He says that it's a shame.</font>

165
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't work?</font>

166
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snatching my heart back from Caesar would have gone according to plan.</font>

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only thing I didn't expect was your arrival,</font>

168
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo.</font>

169

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's <i>san</i>!</font>

170
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,010

172
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was planning to silence you either way.</font>

173
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get it over with, then. I don't think I can stand looking at this trash before me for much longer...</font>

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this dangerous looking room?</font>

176
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's something you don't need to know about.</font>

177
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo, I don't want my subordinates to find out about this.</font>

178
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They love you like a father.</font>

179
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To find out that you're Joker's dog...</font>

180
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's too late to do anything about that.</font>

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already met them a few minutes ago.</font>

182
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do?</font>

183
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What indeed?</font>

184
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo!</font>

185
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem pretty upset, Smoker-kun.</font>

186
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you seriously worried about those misfit Marines?</font>

187
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As base leader I can do whatever I want to my useless subordinates.</font>

188
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And since you guys know too much, I'm gonna have to make you disappear.</font>

189
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter how long you've been with them,</font>

190
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or that you're their base leader.</font>

191
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you left the base, they've become my subordinates.</font>

192
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you lay a finger on them!</font>

194
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened here?</font>

195
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot, hot it's damn hot!</font>

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nowhere left to walk.</font>

197
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what on earth happened here?!</font>

198
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry it up, bring the injured people to the front.</font>

199
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And protect Tashigi-chan!</font>

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop acting so friendly! We're enemies!</font>

201
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's only according to society's rules, pirates are free to do what they want.</font>

202
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way you kicked that fake Vergo is enough to even make a man fall in love with you.</font>

203
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was really cool, bro.</font>

204
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut it! I said I don't want any cheers from the men!</font>

205
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop calling that pirate "bro"!</font>

206
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A tank exploded!</font>

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad. It punched a hole through the wall.</font>

208
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the other side too. Damn it all!</font>

209
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run, you guys!</font>

210
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gas is leaking in from outside!</font>

211
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the killer gas from earlier!</font>

212
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't want to die then start running!</font>

213
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even this huge space in Building B will be flooded with gas in no time!</font>

214
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop whining and get moving!</font>

215
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tashigi-chan, run!</font>

216
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll die if you hesitate! Just focus on going the right way!</font>

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg!</font>

218
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, you guys! You're gonna die at that pace!</font>

219
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,600
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Building R, 2nd Floor - The Secret Room</font>

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys are such idiots.</font>

221
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who would've thought that they'd let in the Shinokuni themselves?</font>

222
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if they die where they are, it won't be on my experiment broadcast.</font>

223
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, close the gates to Buildings C and D.</font>

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, but what about Building R?</font>

225
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave that one open.</font>

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna set a trap for those idiots on the first floor of Building R.</font>

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are heading for Gate 66 in the R-Building.</font>

228
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll lead them there to make sure that they don't get sidetracked.</font>

229
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really hate this room.</font>

230
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The second floor of the Building R - The Secret Room.</font>

231
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never wanted to use this room.</font>

232
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I can't let the Straw Hats get away.</font>

233
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've gotten far too confident.</font>

234
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have Joker backing me.</font>

235
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once they're in that room, I'll kill them all.</font>

236
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master, we finished our preparations for battle a long time ago.</font>

237
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you call us here to the old office of that despicable Vegapunk?</font>

238
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vegapunk created that incident four years ago, so he is our enemy as well.</font>

239
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure we should be sitting here doing nothing?</font>

240
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shouldn't we go and fight them?</font>

241
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nope, it's fine.</font>

242
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are my special forces,</font>

243
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wish for your blood to be spilled in vain.</font>

244
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Master!</font>

245
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, it's time to explain my plan.</font>

246
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've closed the doors leading to Buildings C and D.</font>

247
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so now all open corridors in the laboratory lead to the room below us,</font>

248
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the first floor of the Building R.</font>

249
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hats, G-5 and the children...</font>

250
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>All</i> the survivors will end up in this room.</font>

251
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the first floor of Building R has air vents.</font>

252
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, those air vents will flood it with Shinokuni.</font>

253
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There will be nowhere for them to run.</font>

254
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That way, no one can survive.</font>

255
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With all the gates closed, it will become one big gas chamber.</font>

256
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The video feed from that room is already being sent to all the brokers in the New World.</font>

257
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That way I can show my skill to the entire underworld.</font>

258
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I may, Master Caesar...</font>

259
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you the one that created that horrifying poison gas?</font>

260
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it looks like the poisonous gas that Dr. Vegapunk released four years ago.</font>

261
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really creeps us all out.</font>

262
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

263
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a scientific battle for vengeance!</font>

264
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, my subordinates...</font>

265
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On that day, I tried to stop him.</font>

266
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mad scientist Vegapunk.</font>

267
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"If you lost control of that weapon,</font>

268
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:10,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just what do you think would happen to all the people on this island? Stop it, Vegapunk!"</font>

269
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But still, the accident occurred.</font>

270
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he continues to lead the Navy's top scientists,</font>

271
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as the world's greatest scientist!</font>

272
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't stand it!</font>

273
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can we really allow the cruel man who hurt all of you...</font>

274
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to keep being praised as the greatest scientist in the world?!</font>

275
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

276
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I have have to prove that I'm better than him!</font>

277
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By creating a weapon of mass destruction even though I didn't want to!</font>

278
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To prove that I am the world's greatest scientist, not him!</font>

279
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When the Navy accepts that, and I'm the science division's lead scientist,</font>

280
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then my dream to use science to bring about world peace can come true!</font>

281
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

282
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry Master. We're ashamed to have ever doubted you.</font>

283
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are our god of salvation!</font>

284
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop it, Caesar!</i></font>

285
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop the experiment right now!</i></font>

286
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you lost control of that weapon,</i></font>

287
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,000

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Silence, you brainless fools!</i></font>

289
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Where do you think we are?!</i></font>

290
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's the Navy's research facility.</i></font>

291
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They want us to create a weapon that could kill many pirates at once.</i></font>

292
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They don't want a weapon that would kill innocent civilians as well!</i></font>

293
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You idiot.</i></font>

294
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's what we call acceptable losses.</i></font>

295
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's their own fault for being in the line of fire.</i></font>

296
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If we destroy everything, the world will truly be at peace.</i></font>

297
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You are so...</i></font>

298
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cruel?</i></font>

299
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now, isn't that funny!</i></font>

300
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How is this any different from you experimenting on the prisoners here, like they were garbage?</i></font>

301
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The current Fleet Admiral Sengoku is naive,</i></font>

302
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>but Admiral Akainu should see the value of my weapon.</i></font>

303
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now if you understand, get out of here.</i></font>

304
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're in the way!</i></font>

305
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Vegapunk is just jealous of my genius.</i></font>

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I heard that he failed at gigantification again.</i></font>

307
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is science, not magic! Humans aren't going to grow into giants without effort!</i></font>

311
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,890

312
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Vegapunk, what is the meaning of this?!</i></font>

313
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You have been expelled from the science division.</i></font>

314
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your research is far too dangerous.</i></font>

315
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can no longer overlook it.</i></font>

316
