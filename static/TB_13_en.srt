137
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool! Why would I do that for strangers?!</font>

138
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They requested my aid for the same reason you admired me!</font>

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was because I was a genius!</font>

140
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was all about the money!</font>

141
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't want to help all those patients who kept coming incessantly from all over the world!</font>

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Please help my father!"</font>

143
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Save my child!"</font>

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Help my boyfriend!"</font>

145
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a huge annoyance!</font>

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So troublesome.</font>

147
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to pay for the incompetence of all those pathetic doctors who couldn't even save a life.</font>

148
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you comprehend the trouble of being such a genius?!</font>

149
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether you respect me or not is up to you,</font>

150
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the mere fact that I disappointed you is ridiculous.</font>

151
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can't stand me as a doctor because of your absurd ideals...</font>

152
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then you're deceiving yourself, stupid reindeer!</font>

153
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to tell me what a doctor should be?!{edited for clarity - Sky}</font>

154
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't intend to tell you anything!{Retranslated to match previous line - Sky}</font>

155
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think of you as a doctor anymore!</font>

156
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The same goes for those zombies!</font>

157
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just empty shells moving to your will!</font>

158
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not alive!</font>

159
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't play with life!</font>

160
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a cruel statement.</font>

161
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You deny their livelihood despite seeing them move before your very eyes?!</font>

162
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granting a new life to the dead is a true miracle!</font>

163
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you possibly deny the existence of this?!</font>

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

165
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, lick the floor, Cindry.{the first , seems appropriate here, should probably leave it}{added "then" to give it proper pacing in english - Sky}</font>

166
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Hogback-sama.</font>

167
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw that room, didn't you, Dr. Chopper?</font>

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's my room.</font>

169
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All those were pictures of the stage actress Victoria Cindry, back when she was alive.</font>

170
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I completely fell in love with her.</font>

171
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only me, but men from the entire country, fell for such beauty.</font>

172
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's fixed now, Doctor.</i></font>

173
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>S-Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb my patient just to get my buttons sewn!</i></font>

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's no problem!</i></font>

175
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A very popular yet unpretentious person...</font>

176
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">devoted to her family,</font>

177
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was kind to everyone... truly a wonderful woman.</font>

178
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but she...</font>

179
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">rejected my proposal, the proposal of a doctor who had everything...</font>

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All because of that accursed fiancé of hers...!</font>

181
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then...</font>

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable news reached my ears...</font>

183
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry... died in an accident.</font>

184
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My pain was indescribable...</font>

185
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I abandoned my work...</font>

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was then that a huge man appeared before me...</font>

187
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My master, Gekko Moriah!</font>

188
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dr. Hogback, lend me your power!</i></font>

189
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we agreed that, in exchange for resurrecting Cindry with his miraculous ability, I would stay on this ship.{maybe we should split this into 3 parts? to avoid the sceene bleeding? -punkid}</font>

190
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I stole her body...</font>

191
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and by doing so, I easily gained control over the actress Cindry!</font>

192
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-chan!</font>

193
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be best if all the plates disappear...</font>

194
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't care about who the woman was inside her body...</font>

195
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as she had her beauty...</font>

196
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Cindry-chan's zombie!</font>

197
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm full of joy, and so is she.</font>

198
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I granted her a second opportunity to live as a human in this world!</font>

199
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you call this human?!</font>

200
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make her stop!</font>

201
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A person with no connection between heart and body can't be called human!</font>

202
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're using soulless bodies...</font>

203
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're just creating monsters!</font>

204
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You make people unhappy by creating those zombies!</font>

205
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I'm aware of this, I won't let you off!</font>

206
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't talk to me about "life" with your limited medical skills, pirate-deer!{edited to sound more like an insult - Sky}</font>

207
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-chan, get rid of them!</font>

208
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll turn you both into marionettes!</font>

209
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be grateful, Dr. Chopper.</font>

210
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you die, you'll become
the assistant of the person you admired!</font>

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Angular Edge Plate...</font>

212
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,510

213
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two!</font>

214
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three!</font>

215
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop...</font>

216
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

217
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

218
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't look down on her just because she's a woman!</font>

219
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've increased her strength for battle!</font>

220
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have to listen to him!</font>

221
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will kill you!</font>

222
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel bad for you. You're already dead.</font>

223
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How would the rest of your family feel if they knew about this?!</font>

224
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me... go!</font>

225
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Covered with patches, becoming just a mindless soldier...</font>

226
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your relatives wouldn't bear to see you like this...</font>

227
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damned... let me go!</font>

228
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heart you were born with is dead now...</font>

229
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your body moves under other people's wills...</font>

230
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of life is that?!</font>

231
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You doubt your eyes?!</font>

232
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Accept it! This is the eternal dream of humans, revival of the dead!</font>

233
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The dead have been resurrected!</font>

234
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if they can move, it's enough?!</font>

235
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans have more freedom than that!</font>

236
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are not even treating them as humans!</font>

237
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin! Hurry and give her salt!</font>

241
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get rid of that nuisance!</font>

242
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I failed!</font>

251
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Disappear!</font>

252
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you attack me too?!</font>

253
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get in my way!</font>

254
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you made me angry!</font>

255
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd be you!</font>

256
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I received that order!</font>

257
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was me!</font>

258
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what're you doing?!</font>

259
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out already!</font>

260
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be coopera-</font>

262
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such an amusing incident, don't you think?</font>

263
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All because of the order given to get rid of the nuisances.</font>

264
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even with their memories erased...</font>

265
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that the true nature of those two is to always be in conflict.</font>

266
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm shocked...</font>

267
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This seems like a tall tower.</font>
