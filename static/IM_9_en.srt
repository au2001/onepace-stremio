1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From what I heard, you're the one who took down that former Shichibukai Crocodile over there, huh?</font>

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back then, when I was still trying to become a Shichibukai,</font>

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought the best idea was to kill you and use that to prove my strength to the World Government.</font>

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whitebeard's reign is over!
I'll become the next Pirate King!</i></font>

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>For starters, I'm gonna kill
Straw Hat Luffy, who is in Water Seven,</i></font>

7
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>as a gift to the Government!</i></font>

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Another reason I can't let you go free!</i></font>

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's my brother!</i></font>

10
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it seems fate was in your favor!</font>

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace, who had been chasing me ever since I broke the laws of Whitebeard's ship,</font>

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just happened to be your brother!</font>

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once he realized that we were planning to kill his little brother,</font>

14
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he just had to fight us himself!</font>

15
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You understand?</font>

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he'd let us go, not only would he have disgraced Whitebeard,</font>

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but his brother would have been killed, too!</font>

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no such thing as coincidence in one's fate.</font>

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meaning...</font>

20
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got real lucky!</font>

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that the captain has become a Shichibukai, he has no need to take your life.</font>

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your brother put up an admirable fight!</font>

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be thankful for Ace's interference.</font>

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he hadn't interfered, the one dying today, {here}</font>

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">would be you, Straw Hat.</font>

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case...</font>

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHY DON'T YOU TRY KILLING ME NOW?!</font>

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

29
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not letting Ace die!</font>

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no Jet...</font>

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Vortex!</font>

32
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan!</font>

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blood? Isn't he a rubber man?</font>

34
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Devil Fruit powers are useless against me!</font>

35
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And so what?!</font>

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Luffy-kun! Stop!{Jinbei just casually steps in the way of Luffy mid-attack. how cool is he?}</font>

37
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go!</font>

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not the time! Just endure it!</font>

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me!</font>

40
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't, Luffy-kun!</font>

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's more important here?!</font>

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think! Luffy-kun!</font>

43
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since he was on old Whitebeard's ship, no one's ever known his true nature.</font>

44
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what tricks he used, but he certainly possesses the power to defeat even Ace-san!</font>

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't afford to waste time and energy here!</font>

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get carried away and fight him now,</font>

47
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we won't have time to save Ace-san afterward!</font>

48
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're even stronger than I had imagined.</font>

49
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your haki has increased, too.</font>

50
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said you're Blackbeard, right?</font>

51
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd heard that some no-name pirate from Whitebeard's crew had taken my place in the Shichibukai.</font>

52
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But isn't this odd?</font>

53
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you, who's been called to Navy HQ, be down here right now?</font>

54
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're pretty much throwing away the
Shichibukai rank that you wanted so badly.</font>

55
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all part of my plan.</font>

56
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like I'm obligated to tell you anything...</font>

57
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Mister Crocodile.</font>

58
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true, and to be honest, I don't really care.</font>

59
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pretty touchy, aren't you?</font>

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey wait! What's going on?!</font>

61
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan is here!</font>

62
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good!</font>

63
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

64
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and go!</font>

65
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou're hit by any more of Magellan's poison, Vi won't be able to bring vyou back again!</font>

66
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Prison Warden Magellan!</font>

67
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, crap... Hurry up and run!</font>

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden... Magellan!</font>

69
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank God... The Warden is here!</font>

70
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan... So he finally shows himself?</font>

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Climb the stairs! The bazooka squad's gone!</font>

72
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The path is clear!</font>

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! Hurry and climb up to Level Three!</font>

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You took out the guards blocking the stairs... That makes things easier for us.</font>

75
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you guys helped us too.
All this panic is real convenient for us.</font>

76
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! It's the stairwell to Level Three!</font>

77
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get moving!</font>

78
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's another Demon Guard!</font>

79
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Minotaurus!</font>

80
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! The Minotaurus?!</font>

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't we beat that thing back in Level Three?!</font>

82
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it recovered.</font>

83
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're awakened Zoan-type Fruit users.</font>

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're much tougher and recover much faster than normal people.</font>

85
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those things are Devil Fruit users as well?!</font>

86
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay here for too long, the other three will get up again too.</font>

87
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is not the time to be scared of those things.</font>

88
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The boss of Hell is just around the corner.</font>

89
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan!</font>

90
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've received word that Blackbeard is on this floor, at the stairwell to Level Three!</font>

91
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shiryuu should have already dealt with Blackbeard!</font>

92
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was he defeated?</font>

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the monitoring room!</font>

94
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?!</font>

95
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's terrible!</font>

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The main Surveillance Snail was taken out!</font>

97
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The monitoring system for the entire prison has been destroyed!</font>

98
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's more, all connections to Navy HQ and the Government have been severed!</font>

99
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've completely lost contact with-</font>

100
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

101
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What's wrong?! What happened?!</font>

102
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did this?!</font>

103
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go tattling on me...</font>

104
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or Magellan will know I'm here.</font>

105
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've lost contact!</font>

106
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send someone to confirm the situation!</font>

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

108
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not good.</font>

109
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Blackbeard is on this floor,</font>

110
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it means he has unsealed the door that I sealed on Level Two!</font>

111
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything seems to be going wrong here!</font>

112
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This entire mess has broken out because we allowed one little mouse to break in!</font>

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buggy!{Socky}</font>

114
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister Three!{supie}</font>

115
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buggy!{Socky}</font>

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister Three!{supie}</font>

117
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! We got flashily lucky!</font>

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men! We're finally on Level One!</font>

119
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone! We're about to reach the outside, where the sun shines!</font>

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our great savior, Captain Buggy!</font>

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm definitely going to save Ace!</font>

122
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, I won't say it's useless.</font>

123
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, there's no such thing as "impossible" in this world.</font>

124
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sky Island did exist, didn't it?</font>

125
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The era where pirates dream is over?!</i></font>

126
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh?!</i></font>

127
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>People's dreams...</i></font>

128
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>NEVER END!</i></font>

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ain't that right?!</i></font>

130
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One Piece is the same.</font>

131
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It definitely exists!</font>

132
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look forward to it, you guys!</font>

133
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,530

269
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep Out!</font>

270
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another attempt to stall for time?</font>

271
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're here!</font>

272
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We finally made it here, and now all four Demon Guards are here too!</font>

273
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

274
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is as far as we go! Let's turn back! We can't win!</font>

275
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just give up on escaping!</font>

276
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHAAAAAT?!</font>

277
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?</font>

278
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Watch it, you crock o-</font>

279
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">-DILE?! {Yeah, I couldn't really think of any way to make this sound good.kae: I went with 'crock of shit' getting truncated. it might be over-localized, but buggy is weird.}</font>

280
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-B-B-B-Boss?!</font>

281
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's you, Mister Three.</font>

282
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's a worthless piece of trash like you doing here?</font>

283
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's quite a big shot they've released...</font>

284
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Captain Buggy!</font>

285
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've knocked out the Demon Guards!</font>

286
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Straw Hat?!</font>

287
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is that the Shichibukai, Jinbei?!</font>

288
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief! So you guys are alright?</font>

289
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}(What a relief! So you guys are alright?)</i></font>

290
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart!</font>

291
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts!</font>

292
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Buggy!</font>

293
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prisoners and perverts just keep coming up from Level Two!{what a line!}</font>

294
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perverts too?!</font>

295
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?!</font>

296
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you calling perverts?!</font>

297
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two... How dare you abandon us back there?</font>

298
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're here too, Mister Two?!</font>

299
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing to Captain Buggy?!</font>

300
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

301
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prisoners from Level Four have finally made it up here!</font>

302
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they manage to escape from Warden Magellan?</font>

303
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?</font>

304
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two insurgent groups have joined forces!</font>

305
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the Warden?!</font>

306
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydra!</font>

307
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">MAGELLAN TOO?!</font>

308
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHAT IS GOING ON HERE ON THIS FLOOR?!</font>

309
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! Does that mean that Iva-chan and Crab-chan were...</font>

310
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

311
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't, Straw-chan!</font>

312
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got no choice but to run from Magellan!</font>

313
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me, Bon-chan!</font>

314
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kick his ass!</font>

315
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure?</font>

316
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand, but do you really want us to?</font>

317
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. Follow my orders, and do it quickly!</font>

318
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

319
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, so that's their plan?!</font>

320
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You almost died because of him, remember?!</font>

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm still alive, aren't I?</font>

322
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Miracles are called that because they won't happen twice, you know!</font>

323
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two, hurry to the next floor!</font>

324
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun!</font>

325
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must hurry to the main entrance!</font>

326
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The situation has gotten worse...</font>

327
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been too focused on Magellan!</font>

328
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydra!</font>

329
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, get out of the way!</font>

330
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle Wall!</font>

331
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three!</font>

332
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He stopped Magellan's Hydra!</font>

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That optimism of yours makes me want to puke!</font>

334
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The second I let my guard down, I start thinking of you as a friend!</font>

335
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh...</font>

336
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate being indebted to others!</font>

337
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've underestimated you, Brother Three!</font>

338
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. Wax, huh?</font>

339
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

340
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ate the Doru Doru fruit. I'm a candle-man.</font>

341
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your poison will never be able to pass through my hard-as-steel wax wall!</font>

342
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You never know how suitable some powers can be.</font>

343
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, hurry up and go!</font>

344
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I give up quickly, you know!</font>

345
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three!</font>

346
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How irritating.</font>

347
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to be hesitating! I can't hold him back for long!</font>

348
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right. Then we'll just get going.</font>

349
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, men!</font>

350
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you always this good?!</font>

351
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, as long as I'm not on a hot floor...</font>

352
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now all of you, hurry and get out!</font>

353
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to escape too, you know!</font>

354
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun. We must hurry as well!</font>

355
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah, you said we're gonna steal a warship, right?</font>

356
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did.</font>

357
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then you and the others should just go on ahead.</font>

358
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll try stopping the poison guy in the meantime.</font>

359
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, it'll be hard to steal one while he's chasing us.</font>

360
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that's true...</font>

361
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got an idea.</font>

362
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it stand a chance?</font>

363
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, leave it to me!</font>

364
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand. Just don't do anything too reckless!</font>

365
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Three! Let's fight together!</font>

366
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's wrong! I have absolutely no intention of fighting!</font>

367
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My only intent was to guard us the best I could and run away!</font>

368
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother Three! We'll stay behind and help, too!</font>

369
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you, I'm not that motivated!</font>

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">THIS IS JUST TOO COOL!</font>

371
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's perfect!</font>

372
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pay attention to what's in front of you!</font>

373
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about, at a time like this?!</font>

374
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tears just won't stop...!</font>

375
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for making me look so awesome...!</font>

376
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I care! Hurry up and fight him!</font>

377
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Here he comes!</font>

378
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hydra!</font>

379
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three!</font>

380
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!</font>

381
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle Wall!</font>

382
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how many times you try, it won't work!</font>

383
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

384
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Champion Rifle!</font>

385
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I can touch him now!</font>

386
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got the cannons ready over here!</font>

387
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The candle wall is shielding us!</font>

388
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome! We hit him!</font>

389
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can do this!</font>

390
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

391
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're almost there! Push for the surface!</font>

392
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just a little further!</font>

393
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can finally get out!</font>

394
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since we've made it this far, there's nobody left who can call themselves our enemies!</font>

395
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down, amateur.</font>

396
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

397
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outside these walls, there are at least ten warships.</font>

398
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are about eight hundred marines on each ship.</font>

399
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what kind of plan they've got to intercept us,</font>

400
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but stealing one of the ships means we'll be making the other ships our enemies.</font>

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to take it easy.</font>

402
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I see...</font>

403
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not the only problem here.</font>

404
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no guards left!</font>

405
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we just have to get through this door!</font>

406
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Prepare your weapons, all of you!</font>

407
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's open the door!</font>

408
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do this! Ready, push!</font>

409
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally, we'll see the light of the outside world!</font>

410
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! We're not out of this just yet!</font>

411
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The navy troops are waiting right outside this door...</font>

412
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we win, we'll reach Heaven! If we lose, we'll go to Hell!</font>

413
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's light!</font>

414
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're getting out of here!</font>

415
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you, put some spirit into it!</font>

416
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know how many troops are waiting for us, but we <i>will</i> beat 'em and return to sea!</font>

417
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's go, men!</font>

418
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's go, men!</font>

419
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow my lead!</font>

420
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... is going on here?!</font>

421
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There aren't any warships around!</font>

422
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's not a single warship for us to steal!</font>

423
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There isn't a single marine here, either!</font>

424
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way... That means...</font>

425
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way out, is there?!</font>

426
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we gonna do?</font>

427
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there nothing to do...</font>

428
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but wait helplessly for Magellan to arrive?</font>

429
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! You gotta be kidding me!</font>

430
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. So the enemy wasn't as stupid as I thought.</font>

431
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The great Sea Kings are lurking on the ocean floor.</font>

432
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This Calm Belt here is truly
Impel Down's greatest defense.</font>

433
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We finally made it all the way here, from the depths of Hell!</font>

434
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! At this rate, we'll only fall right back into Hell!</font>

435
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no time to stand around crying!</font>

436
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan ordered them to set sail just a few minutes ago.</font>

437
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a good look!</font>

438
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can still barely see their shadows through the mist!</font>

439
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You're right!</font>

440
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But how is being able to see them in the distance gonna help us?!</font>

441
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry!</font>

442
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here! You can leave this to me!</font>

443
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?!</font>

444
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's freakishly strong!</font>

445
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All those who have the resolve to fight, get on!</font>

446
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's move out!</font>

447
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well! Let us hurry!</font>

448
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's surging forward while carrying that heavy door!</font>

449
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what I'd expect from the captain of the Fishman Pirates!</font>

450
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really getting excited here!</font>

451
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought I'd see a Shichibukai in action!</font>

452
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only that, but our savior, Captain Buggy, is with them!</font>

453
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still hope for us!</font>

454
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You dumbasses!</font>

455
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's obviously much safer with these Shichibukai than staying there and dreading Magellan!</font>

456
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fools!</font>

457
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're shooting at us!</font>

458
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they spotted us. {sexy voice}</font>

459
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He dodged it! He's fast!</font>

460
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think he's just any fishman! He's the Sea Knight, Jinbei!</font>

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All ships, fire!</font>

462
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we just sink Jinbei, they're all done for!</font>

463
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warships coming in hard and fast!</font>

464
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll launch you onto the deck of one of the ships! Hold on tight!</font>

465
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! What did you say?!</font>

466
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn fish!</font>

467
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You listening, bastard?!</font>

468
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHAT IS GOING ON?!</font>

469
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see! He abandoned us and ran off on his own!</font>

470
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR! TRAITOR!</font>

471
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you even come along?</font>

472
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll hit us if this keeps up!</font>

473
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just calm down, you.</font>

474
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Jujutsu...</font>

475
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Water Heart...</font>

476
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">IT'S COMING THIS WAY!</font>

477
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sea Current Lifter!</font>

478
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WE'RE FLYING!</font>

479
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that water pillar?</font>

480
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost like a living creature!</font>

481
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could that be?!</font>

482
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

483
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But someone's riding it... It's Crocodile!</font>

484
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they are!</font>

485
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've come to steal the ship!</font>

486
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them take it!</font>

487
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can push the Devil Fruit users into the ocean, we win!</font>

488
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>
