121
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is unbelievable.
It'd take too long to explain it all...</font>

122
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it's the undeniable truth.</font>

123
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Noah has stopped!</font>

124
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't completely destroyed either!</font>

125
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island... has been saved!</font>

126
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat did it!</font>

127
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tale of the ship has been passed down since the old times, so that we may do so.</font>

132
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that why the Noah is so big?!</font>

133
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

134
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,910

our king is born into the body of one of the merfolk.</font>

135
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder why?</font>

136
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why indeed.</font>

137
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's you.</font>

138
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since you have been born,</font>

139
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you have been our Queen.</font>

140
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Honorable brother!</font>

141
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... Shirahoshi... She can't be...</font>

142
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must be speaking with the Sea Kings!</font>

143
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it!</font>

144
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Several Sea Kings
suddenly appeared outside of Fishman Island.</font>

145
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost as if to stop Luffy-san from destroying the Noah.</font>

146
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They came to protect it.
That's what it looks like, at least.</font>

147
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps the Noah is somehow important to them?</font>

148
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama!</font>

149
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sea Kings.</font>

150
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, it's finally awakened.</font>

151
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power that could destroy the world itself.</font>

152
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look.  The bubble is being absorbed by the island.</font>

153
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans can't survive on the ocean floor.</font>

154
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go to him.</font>

155
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

156
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awful!</font>

157
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps I was imagining it?</font>

158
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That human with the hat.  He heard our voices.</font>

159
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He couldn't have.</font>

160
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This happened before, a little while back.</font>

161
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it did.</font>

162
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Rayleigh, did you hear that voice?!</i></font>

163
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are you talking about?</i></font>

164
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're in the complete silence of the deep sea.</i></font>

165
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who's there?!  Who's talking so far underwater?!</i></font>

166
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  Show yourself!</i></font>

167
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder why.</font>

168
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why indeed.</font>

169
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sea Kings?!</font>

170
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-They're carrying the Noah!</font>

171
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They're gonna eat us!</i></font>

172
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship is badly damaged.</font>

173
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can it be fixed?  Can it still still serve its purpose?</font>

174
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows?</font>

175
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To fix it, we'd need the skills of that clan...</font>

176
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but times have changed.</font>

177
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can it be fixed?</font>

178
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hopefully it will be fixed...</font>

179
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">before the promised time comes.</font>

180
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Ryuuguu Palace!  Come in, Left Minister!</font>

181
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have an urgent report for you!</font>

182
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

183
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mermaids who were kidnapped...</font>

184
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">have been found inside of the castle!</font>

185
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  So, are they alright?!</font>

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.  They're a little dazed,</font>

187
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they say they can
remember the face of their captor clearly!</font>

188
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unfortunately, the treasure room
was found empty at the same time.</font>

189
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There isn't anything left at all.</font>

190
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, this includes
the national treasure, the Tamate Box!</font>

191
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It appears someone has robbed us
while we were away!</font>

193
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind some petty thief stealing treasure.</font>

194
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We could have lost the entire country
just now -jamon.</font>

195
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly,
tell everybody that the girls are safe.</font>

196
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might be a little late, but we must show that the Straw Hats are innocent.</font>

197
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've done something terrible.</font>

198
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anyone tries to use bubbles to escape...</font>

199
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll shoot them down!</font>

200
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dammit!</i></font>

201
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have mercy, Boss!  Let us go!</font>

202
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was just scared of Hody and his bunch!</font>

203
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can go, right?!</font>

204
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have anything to do with
the conflict on this island!  We're just humans!</font>

205
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island depends on tourism and
the money it gets from human pirate visitors, right?!</font>

206
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us go!</font>

207
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never said that we'd kill you.</font>

208
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for the Neptune Royal Family's judgment.</font>

209
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an announcement for all citizens.</font>

210
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates...</font>

211
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">had no involvement in the kidnapping of the mermaids.</font>

212
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We admit that we did not check the facts properly.</font>

213
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We truly regret it,
and would like to offer our sincerest apologies.</font>

214
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hats didn't kidnap them after all.</font>

215
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew they couldn't have done it all along!</font>

216
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lie!</font>

217
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We all thought that they were the culprits.</font>

218
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, we believed in them, right?</font>

219
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sure.</font>

220
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liars!</font>

221
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quiet!</font>

222
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're being unfair!</font>

223
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

224
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must admit it.</font>

225
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We doubted them...</font>

226
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We doubted them because they were human!</font>

227
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how it's always been.</font>

228
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've always seen the humans as...</font>

229
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super...</font>

230
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afro!</font>

231
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky-san, that is quite stylish!</font>

232
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super, isn't it?</font>

233
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get completely worn out
whenever I use the Monster Point,</font>

234
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I can't even walk for two or three hours.</font>

235
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... I can still treat your wounds.</font>

236
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is everyone alright?</font>

237
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You</i> aren't alright.</font>

238
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone seems fine.</font>

239
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Robin-chan!</i></font>

240
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used my ultimate technique too, so I'm completely worn out!</font>

241
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me rest on your lap!</font>

242
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pwease!</font>

243
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just sleep on the ground.</font>

244
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you!</font>

245
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy.</font>

246
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Princes!</font>

247
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody?!</font>

248
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken?!</font>

249
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, you must have been worried.</font>

250
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just glad you're safe -jamon.</font>

251
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone!  You can rest easy!</font>

252
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These men will no longer be allowed to run wild!</font>

253
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we can live without worrying!</font>

254
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe someone so scary
was in the Fishman District, so close to us.</font>

255
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Captain Hody!</font>

256
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He looks like a monster!</font>

257
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great!</font>

258
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, isn't that...</font>

259
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's back!</font>

260
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!</font>

261
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Straw Hat Luffy and Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

262
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, help him!</font>

263
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama won't stop bleeding!</font>

264
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama pushed himself too far for our sake.</font>

265
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat.</font>

266
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awful!  I've got something to stop the bleeding in my backpack.</font>

267
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm counting on you, Robin.</font>

268
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

269
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really worried about our next fight, Doc!</font>

270
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, I'm ready!</font>

271
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll move you.</font>

272
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a really freaky doctor!</font>

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A little to the left... the left...</font>

274
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you save Luffy-sama?!</font>

275
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can stop the bleeding,
but he's already lost so much blood.</font>

276
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't have enough left!</font>

277
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

278
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's the only one in the crew with blood type F.</font>

279
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's terrible!</font>

280
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must be someone else with that blood type
here in the plaza!</font>

281
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone!</font>

282
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

283
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... I've got F.</font>

284
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have type F, but...</font>

285
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Daddy, you're type F, right?</font>

286
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, well...</font>

287
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right!  This country has a law against donating blood to humans!</font>

288
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of law is that?!  That's awful!</font>

289
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!  Luffy's in trouble!</font>

290
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My blood type is different, but it's still red!</font>

291
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will that do?!</font>

292
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, no.  I appreciate the sentiment, at least.</font>

293
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

294
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know!  There are some human pirates here too!</font>

295
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use my blood.</font>

296
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's type F.  I'll give you as much as you need.</font>

297
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe!</font>

298
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-chan!</font>

299
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, the law...</font>

300
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a pirate.</font>

301
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!  What a relief!</font>

302
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Jinbe-san!</i></font>

303
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

304
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, you-</font>

305
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine -jamon.</font>

306
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Your Majesty?</font>

307
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the problem?  Outdated laws...</font>

308
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are just curses.</font>

309
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, this'll hurt a little.</font>

310
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't mind.</font>

311
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even when you're hurt,</i></font>

312
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>even when you're doing the hurting,</i></font>

313
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>red blood flows through your veins.</i></font>

314
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This thin, tiny tube,</i></font>

315
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>too small to be considered a path,</i></font>

316
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>is what breaks through the prejudiced fear...</i></font>

317
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and the battles that tried to
wash away blood with more blood.</i></font>

318
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So easily it flows.</i></font>

319
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It is not some fleeting vision in the clouds,</i></font>

320
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>but a clearly visible path that leads to the sun.</i></font>

321
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe.</font>

322
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, you're awake!</font>

323
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy!</i></font>

324
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy!</i></font>

325
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, you were conscious?</font>

326
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw Hat!</i></font>

327
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy!</i></font>

328
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is... our new beginning,</font>

329
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother!</font>

330
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Jinbe.</font>

331
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Join my crew!</font>

332
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Royal Family has made its decision!</font>

333
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  We're free!</font>

334
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serves you right, Hody!</font>

335
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I'd live the rest of my days as a slave!</font>

336
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Pirates, we owe you one!</font>

337
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna become the Pirate King!</font>

338
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  I don't know about that...</font>

339
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!  I'm gonna do it!</font>

340
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can finally go to the New World!</font>

341
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if their grudge against Hody
turns into a grudge against Fishman Island?</font>

342
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That shouldn't change my decision.  This island
is a rest stop and tourism destination for pirates.</font>

343
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They didn't come here with ill intentions.</font>

344
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no reason for us to keep them -jamon.</font>

345
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, as for the remaining members of
the New Fishman Pirates!</font>

346
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please don't execute us!</font>

347
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Spare our lives!</font>

348
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't know anything about Hody murdering the Queen!</font>

349
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all insane!</font>

350
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sentence you...</font>

351
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to live here, on Fishman Island's mainland!</font>

352
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!</i></font>

353
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  You mean to live under the law?!</font>

354
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's fine by me.
It's better than being ruled by Hody.</font>

355
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't do that, Your Majesty!
We can't let these guys roam the streets freely.</font>

356
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be scared to let our children out of the house!</font>

357
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, they'll work under my army's command...</font>

358
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and will be pressed into service -jamon</font>

359
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will give them jobs where
their formidable strength can be put to good use!</font>

360
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Fishman District,
which we cannot watch effectively...</font>

361
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will be completely closed off
from this day forward -jamon!</font>

362
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The revelation of the true culprit
behind Queen Otohime's assassination...</i></font>

363
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>has brought the darkness of fishmankind to light.</i></font>

364
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Pirate Hody Jones's plot to conquer Fishman Island...</i></font>

365
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:36,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>was, ironically, foiled by human pirates who had stopped at the island.</i></font>

366
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

367
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is Straw Hat Luffy -jamon?</font>

368
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you see... He ran away.</font>

369
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Ran away?!</font>

370
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I ask why you all left the plaza,
as if you're trying to run away?</font>

371
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a stupid thing to ask!</font>

372
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back there, our fight was staged like a show for the citizens.</font>

373
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stayed in the plaza,
we might be made into some kind of heroes.</font>

374
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just thinking about it makes me shudder.</font>

375
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean to say that
you don't wish to become heroes?</font>

376
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up!  Heroes are the kind of people
who divide up and share their booze!</font>

377
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I wanna drink all of it myself!</font>

378
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again, where did you guys get this idea from?!</font>

379
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why won't you join us, Jinbe?!</font>

380
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go on adventures together!  Please!</font>

381
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go out to sea!  It'll be fun!</font>

382
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, join our crew, Boss!</font>

383
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A former Warlord in our crew would be really reassuring!</font>

384
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Luffy, you need to rest.  Don't get worked up. </font>

385
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm only saying that I can't join you <i>yet</i>.</font>

386
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad that you invited me.</font>

387
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure it would be fun
to travel the seas with all of you...</font>

388
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there are still things I must do first.</font>

389
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things that I am honor bound to do.
I've only taken a short break from those obligations.</font>

390
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:08,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must still complete that journey.
Once I am able to move freely again...</font>

391
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will come to meet up with you.  This I promise you.</font>

392
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you still feel the same way when that time comes,</font>

393
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will you invite me to join once more,
Straw Hat Pirates?</font>

394
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a promise!</font>

395
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, now... When a man is fulfilling his honor,
you shouldn't pressure him.</font>

396
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems Luffy's taken quite a liking to him.</font>

397
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A friend of Luffy's is a friend of ours!
We'll be waiting for you, Jinbe!</font>

398
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

399
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what now?</font>

400
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do we just head straight for the New World?</font>

401
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you saying that you're leaving already?</font>

402
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to thank you properly,
and spend some more time with you.</font>

403
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, then!  Let's spend at least a week in
the Mermaid Café before we leave!</font>

404
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think we don't know
the real reason why you want to do that?!</font>

405
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granted, I completely agree with you!</font>

406
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Please, wait!</font>

407
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

408
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a soldier from the Neptune Army?</font>

409
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please hold on, Straw Hats!</font>

410
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Neptune, I've caught up with the ship.</font>

411
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.  Luffy-kun!</font>

412
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you leave?</font>

413
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still haven't thanked-</font>

414
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna be a hero!</font>

415
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand that.
I just wanted to invite you to a feast!</font>

416
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us resume the feast
that was interrupted before -jamon!</font>

417
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A feast?!</font>

418
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  Let's go call Hachi, Caimie and the others too!</font>

419
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>On Neptune's orders,
the Fishman District was immediately sealed.</i></font>

420
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hody, as well as the New Fishman Pirates' commanders and Vander Decken,</i></font>

421
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>were all locked away in the prison tower.</i></font>

422
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you, Kraken!  Take him to a distant sea!</font>

423
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wadatsumi, there's no cell big enough for you!</font>

424
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are banished from this kingdom!</font>

425
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you find any?</font>

426
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yes!</i></font>

427
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's cook 'em up
and bring 'em all to Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

428
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've invited the Straw Hats to a huge feast.</font>

429
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll handle it!</font>

430
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We heard that sea monster meat is their favorite!</font>

431
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's bring them candy and cakes too!</font>

432
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that they can eat a ton of food!</font>

433
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring everything you have!</font>

434
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do we have enough alcohol?  We'll give 'em
so much top shelf liquor they could bathe in it!</font>

435
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun and his crew,
I'm glad you could come -jamon.</font>

436
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That being said, we can speak at the feast.</font>

437
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The long flounders will carry you to the banquet hall!</font>

438
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, those are some huge rays!</font>

439
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're flounders.</font>

440
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you listen, Luffy?
He just said that they were flounders.</font>

441
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pitch-black, flooded room...</font>

442
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought someone like me
would see Ryuuguu Palace.  I'm so nervous.</font>

443
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've been in Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

444
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?  Where's the meat and feast?</font>

445
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  Our heroes have arrived!</font>

446
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The floor's covered with soldiers!</font>

447
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Heroes!  Heroes!  Heroes!</i></font>

448
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!  Quit saying we're heroes!</font>

449
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm eating all the meat!</font>

450
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  I wanna drink all the booze!</font>

451
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're both hopeless.</font>

452
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, the stage is right ahead!</font>

453
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stage?</font>

454
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First off, let me introduce the pride of Fishman Island, the number one diva on the ocean floor...</font>

455
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maria Napole!</font>

456
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the Swing Jazz Orchestra!</font>

457
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an amazing singing voice! </font>

458
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maria-sama! </font>

459
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My soul is trembling!  Oh yeah!</font>

460
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And our special guests!</font>

461
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way!</font>

462
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men are left breathless by their beauty!</font>

463
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mermaid Café Dancers!</font>

464
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that!</font>

465
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll die, Sanji!</font>

466
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beauty too pure to be captured by a mere picture!
These ladies are number one!</font>

467
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My powuh ith fadibg...</font>

468
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my.</font>

469
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

470
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Simply spellbinding!</font>

471
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie!</font>

472
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ishilly!  You're alright!</font>

473
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally!  Can't have a feast without this!</font>

474
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been super-waiting for this!</font>

475
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd expect no less from Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

476
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much.</font>

477
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most obliged.</font>

478
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thank you.</i></font>

479
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mermaid-chaaaan!</i></font>

480
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much.</font>

481
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cheers!</i></font>

482
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's start drinking!</font>

483
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yummy!</font>

484
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can have as much as you like.</font>

485
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'm done for!</font>

486
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

487
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be more careful, sir.</font>

488
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

489
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi.</font>

490
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers!</font>

491
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers -jamon!  It's alright -jamon!</font>

492
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys too!  Cheers!</font>

493
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cheers!</i></font>

494
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This drink is quite delicious.
Is it made using different water?</font>

495
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so you can tell the difference, Miss?</font>

496
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Refill!</font>

497
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with the pale faces?  My cup's empty!</font>

498
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We lose.</font>

499
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Akkamanbo!  Fuuri!  Fuuri!</font>

500
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep dancing, everyone!</font>

501
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat, drink, and let loose -mi fa so la ti do!</font>

502
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you want to talk about -jamon,</font>

503
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate girl?</font>

504
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me.  I thought this would be
our best chance to be alone.</font>

505
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I should make this clear, I have sworn to love nobody but my wife, Otohime, for the rest of my life!</font>

506
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She might be dead now, but I could never betray-</font>

507
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is Joyboy?</font>

508
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I read a Poneglyph in the Sea Forest.</font>

509
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was he apologizing to?</font>

510
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can read them?!</font>

511
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a survivor from Ohara.
If you don't want to tell me, I won't force you.</font>

512
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

513
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you all that I know.</font>

514
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm okay with you knowing.</font>

515
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joyboy was a man from the surface, who lived during the void century.</font>

516
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he died at least eight hundred years ago?</font>

517
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That message was directed to the Mermaid Princess
who had lived on this island.</font>

518
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was an apology,
because he'd broken a promise to Fishman Island. </font>

519
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Promise?</font>

520
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The details haven't been passed down,</font>

521
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but eventually somebody will come and carry out the promise in Joyboy's place.</font>

522
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the legend that is passed down
through the Royal Family.</font>

523
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We promised to believe in that day,</font>

524
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and each generation has taken its turn to watch over the Noah, as promised.</font>

525
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that day comes,
the Noah will fulfill its mission, at last.</font>

526
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Earlier today,
after everything was finished above the island,</font>

527
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that the half-destroyed Noah was carried into the Sea Forest...</font>

528
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by the Sea Kings.</font>

529
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe Joyboy, who was going to use the Noah, had the power to control the Sea Kings?</font>

530
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it was the former Mermaid Princess
who had that power.</font>

531
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it.
So, does Princess Shirahoshi have the same power?</font>
