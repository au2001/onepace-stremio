74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon me.</font>

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,230

76
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku, what is that stone monster?</font>

77
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is the palace over there?</font>

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found it.</font>

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Viola-san!</font>

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Viola!</font>

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found it, Father.</font>

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The key to Trafalgar Law's handcuffs.</font>

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally found it using my Clairvoyance.</font>

84
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to get it to him somehow.</font>

85
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Viola!  Why are you so concerned about them?</font>

86
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're pirates!</font>

87
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. They are the outlaws who will tear down the peaceful façade of this country!</font>

88
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, I'm betting everything on them, on the Straw Hat Pirates.</font>

89
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirate Doflamingo, who was given the rank of Warlord by the World Government,</font>

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has reigned over this country and caused us all so much pain.</font>

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want any help from the World Government or the Navy, who pretend to be so righteous!</font>

92
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can't hear...</font>

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The voices of the victims...</font>

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enraged screams of this country.</font>

95
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people in charge only ever hear what they want to hear.</font>

96
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At least the Straw Hats have passion behind their words, and they act according to their hearts!</font>

97
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll beat the crap out of Doflamingo!</i></font>

98
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So stay with my crewmates.</i></font>

99
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku. King Riku!</font>

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this man.</font>

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you the five-star?</font>

102
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  He is God Usopp, also known as Usoland!</font>

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This man fought without regard for his own safety...</font>

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And broke the spell on the toys that had endured for ten years!</font>

105
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is our hero!</font>

106
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland!</font>

107
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Usoland! Usoland!</font>

108
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Luffyland is that superhero's captain!</font>

109
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku, the Usolanders, aka the Straw Hat Pirates, are this country's shining star of hope!</font>

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if they are pirates, we will trust them to the very end!</font>

111
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Viola-san, I'll take that key to Lucy.</font>

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca?!</font>

113
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait around here. Please let me go.</font>

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca...</font>

115
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, great idea! Go to Luffy-senpai!</font>

116
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, I'm coming along! Leave it to me!</font>

117
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca, if you go down there, you'll be hunted down as an outlaw in Doflamingo's game.</font>

118
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be easy for you.</font>

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be fine.</font>

120
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, you could go via the rooftops!</font>

121
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kabu-san and I will accompany you, so don't worry!</font>

122
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Via the rooftops?!</font>

123
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! Inhel, I can leave the factory to you, right?</font>

124
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to our reconnaissance unit, Fraland is currently fighting Señor Pink.</font>

126
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will help Fraland to free our captured friends and Princess Mancherie!</font>

127
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.</font>

128
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll see you later!</font>

129
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, there's no time to relax! Let's meet up back here at the royal grounds!</font>

130
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now let's go!</font>

131
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy... What a strange man.</font>

132
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo!</font>

133
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How odd!</font>

134
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! It's so odd!</font>

135
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could those idiots from the Colosseum climb all the way up here?!</font>

136
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought there were thousands of marines down there!</font>

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought so too -<i>in</i>!</font>

138
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice Admiral Bastille and Navy HQ Admiral Fujitora, too!</font>

139
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did they make their way through?!</font>

140
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Is this all the Donquixote Family's got?!</font>

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll reach their boss soon!</font>

142
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a report!</font>

143
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy has made it to the first l-</font>

144
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber Gatling!</font>

145
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outta my way!</font>

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't... c-compete with him...</font>

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

148
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're dropping like flies!</font>

149
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-The Colosseum fighters are coming up too!</font>

150
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

151
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see them, Dellinger!</font>

152
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines are being stalled.</font>

153
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there no way to have you move aside?</font>

155
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

156
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates and those warriors who support them...</font>

157
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let anyone who's trying to hurt them...</font>

158
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go any farther!</font>

159
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it the Revolutionary Army's job to protect pirates?</font>

160
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it is.</font>

161
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As a member of the Revolutionary Army, I won't let you through.</font>

162
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I got it wrong.</font>

163
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As a brother, I can't let you pass!</font>

164
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?</font>

165
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And precisely <i>whose</i> brother might you be?</font>

166
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

167
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That won't hurt me.</font>

168
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have the power of the Mera Mera Fruit.</font>

169
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you kidding me?!</font>

170
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy can't be defeated by a single member of the Revolutionary Army!</font>

171
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!  Don't do it!</font>

172
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

173
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said "Don't!"</font>

174
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy's fingers are freakishly strong!</font>

175
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're claws!</font>

176
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step back!</font>

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can't beat him!</font>

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My fingers are...</font>

179
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dragon claws!</font>

180
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The claws that rip apart those bigoted people in power!</font>

181
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He broke Vice-Admiral Bastille's Shark-Cleaver!</font>

182
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...</font>

183
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These claws can...</font>

184
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">crush human skulls like an egg!</font>

185
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a problem.</font>

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since that bird cage thing is in the way, my meteor's going to be sliced, isn't it?</font>

187
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

188
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a meteorite!</font>

189
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oops! What a fine mess!</font>

190
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over the place...</font>

191
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope no civilians got hurt.</font>

192
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you plan to bring down a meteorite, let us know, Isshou-san!</font>

193
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'm sorry!  I brought one down!</font>

194
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Before</i> you do it!</font>

195
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know the position you're in?</font>

196
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I still haven't gotten used to my own power...</font>

197
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I tried to ward it off.</font>

198
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice Admiral Bastille!</font>

199
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice Admiral!</font>

200
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said you had to do this "as a brother" earlier, did you not?</font>

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

202
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The previous owner of the Mera Mera Fruit, Fire Fist Ace, who died at Marineford,</font>

203
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">claimed that he was Straw Hat's adopted brother.</font>

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean you're his brother too?</font>

205
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We exchanged cups of brotherhood.</font>

206
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're tied by an unbreakable bond.</font>

207
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a troublesome bunch of brothers.</font>

208
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of brothers are they?!</font>

209
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat's brothers...</font>

210
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of them was one of Whitebeard's commanders,</font>

211
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the other one is the Revolutionary Army's second-in-command?!</font>

212
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember this...</font>

213
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Luffy ever calls for my help,</font>

214
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll throw my rank aside and come to his aid, no matter where in the world we are.</font>

215
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never...</font>

220
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess there's no point in asking you any more questions.</font>

221
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't care anyway, do you?</font>

222
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have any sake to go along with your stories.</font>

223
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will...</font>

224
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">protect Luffy!</font>

225

227
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Reaper of the Colosseum!</font>

228
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring the bull down and get him bucked off, then he'll just be a prize in the game!</font>

229
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't underestimate Ucy!</font>

230
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy! Go! Go!</font>

231
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the Reaper! Bow down!</font>

232
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outta the way!</font>

233
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go straight to the palace!</font>

234
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  Cabbage!</font>

235
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!  I'll be going on ahead of you!</font>

236
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I thought I was taking a shortcut!</font>

237
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta run faster, Ucy!</font>

238
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, everybody's catching up!</font>

239
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,640

240
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outta my way! I have no business with you small fry!</font>

241
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gotta keep moving!</font>

242
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no! They're gonna get ahead of me!</font>

243
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shoot, shoot!</font>

244
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come, again!</font>

245
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't wimp out! Shoot the bull!</font>

246
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,290

250
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, don't be so cold.</font>

251
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was a contender in Block C, same as you.</font>

252
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,060
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Assassins From Mogaro, Funk Brothers

254
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were?</font>

255
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

256
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were saved by God Usopp like the others!</font>

257
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found a shortcut to reach the higher levels.</font>

258
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can make it straight to the Sunflower Field,
right in front of the Palace!</font>

259
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Really?!</font>

260
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna help you!</font>

261
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! We're gonna overtake Cabbage and the others in one spurt!</font>

262
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hatter!</font>

263
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When can I get rid of these handcuffs?</font>

264
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With these Sea Stone shackles, I might as well be going there just to get killed by Doflamingo.</font>

265
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it'll work itself out! Let's just go!</font>

266
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you be so sure?!</font>

267
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go back to the plateau where we were before, then!</font>

268
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Why?</font>

269
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll look for the key!</font>

270
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This fight's gonna be win or die!</font>

271
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? There's a shortcut!</font>

272
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, go ahead, Straw Hat. We'll guard the entrance!</font>

273
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, thanks!</font>

274
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy, let's go!</font>

275
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care.</font>

276
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job, Kelly Funk!</font>

277
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure to guard the entrance! Thanks a lot!</font>

278
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They fell... What did they want, after all?</font>

279
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!  Don't worry and keep going, Ucy!</font>

280
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straight to the Sunflower Field!</font>

281
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Straw Hat-san...</font>

282
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-May you be victorious!</font>

283
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Snail Phone...</font>

284
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer it.</font>

285
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

286
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Luffy!</font>

287
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who'll become the Pirate King!</font>

288
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy. It's me.</font>

289
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

290
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're still at the plateau you were at before.</font>

291
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?</font>

292
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're at the first level of the other plateau and heading for the Sunflower Field.</font>

293
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunflower Field is on the fourth level.</font>

294
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Viola found the key to Traf-kun's handcuffs.</font>

295
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah?!</font>

296
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nicoer, get it to me as soon as possible!</font>

297
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?!</font>

298
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, this is Leo of the Dwarf Tribe.</font>

299
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna escort Rebecca-sama, the rooster-human and Robiland there at super high speed!</font>

300
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's meet up at the Sunflower Field on the fourth level.</font>

301
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? How will you guys catch up with us?</font>

302
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll explain later! See you at the Sunflower Field!</font>

303
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?  I told you it's gonna be alright!</font>

304
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a coincidence!</font>

305
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!  Ucy, run!</font>

306
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! He's going in the water!</font>

307
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! It's a dead end!</font>

308
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go back! Hurry!</font>

309
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy! Don't panic!</font>

310
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody's coming.</font>

311
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just a slanted water well.</font>

312
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no shortcut in here.</font>

313
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's you!</font>

314
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="30">Editing: Sewil
Timing: Datenshi
QC: Mr Luffy,
Galaxy 9000
Soundtracking: Halee</font>

315
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo!</font>
