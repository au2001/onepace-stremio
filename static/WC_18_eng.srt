<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, how about this?</font>

238
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

239
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You little...</font>

240
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The lead tastes bitter, doesn't it?</font>

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In his days as a young gangster,
he only killed the leaders of criminal organizations.</font>

242
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And when he became the leader of his own family,
he continued to only kill rival bosses.</font>

243
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bege?</font>

244
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't resist.</font>

245
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Are you betraying me?!</font>

246
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're outnumbered!</font>

247
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bege!</font>

248
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Bege...</font>

249
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">never showed interest
in his enemy's position or territory.</font>

250
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He merely took their valuables and left.</font>

251
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}"Bloody Tragedy! An Internal Feud?!"</i></font>

254
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afterward, he would enjoy watching
 the violent power struggles within the groups</font>

255
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the confusion of their allied syndicates.</font>

256
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is truly a tasteless man.</font>

257
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in this world, what goes around comes around.</font>

259
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However,</font>

260
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bege treats that like a game.
He uses his iron fortress to fight them off,</font>

261
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and mocks the weakness of his enemies.</font>

262
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When he got tired of being on land,
he went out to sea and carried on his own ways.</font>

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

264
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did this?! Damn!</font>

265
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's made his name by taking out pirate captains.
<i>Only</i> the pirate captains.</font>

266
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even at sea, he is plagued
by enemies seeking revenge...</font>

267
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So, working for an emperor

268
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, working for an emperor
is his perfect safe haven.</font>

269
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why he decided to ally with Big Mom.</font>

270
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because Big Mom thought highly of his sharpened
sense of vigilance and incredible defensive ability,</font>

271
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he was granted the title of rook
just before the upcoming tea party,</font>

272
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and placed in charge of security for the entire event.</font>

273
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you telling us this now, Jinbe?</font>

274
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they are the security guards,
nobody can stop them from achieving their goal.</font>

275
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

276
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The main event of this tea party is the wedding.</font>

277
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you are now aware, Big Mom intends to slaughter the Vinsmokes during the ceremony,</font>

278
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and then acquire the remnants of Germa for herself.</i></font>

279
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But meanwhile, behind her back,
 Bege has his own plan to take Big Mom's head.</font>

280
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

281
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is going on?!
Everyone is planning their own conspiracies!</font>

282
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, I'm sure you remember that Pekoms was the one who guided you here.</font>

283
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was kidnapped by Bege,</font>

284
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and they tried to get him to cooperate with their plan.</i></font>

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms... So that's where he went...</font>

286
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pekoms is loyal, so he refused. In order to keep him
quiet, Bege shot him off a cliff into a swarm of sharks.</font>

287
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

288
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

289
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">my companions were watching
and saved him just in time.</font>

290
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's currently recuperating.</font>

291
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness! He's okay!</font>

292
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been through a lot.</font>

293
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn that Bege guy! I'll make him pay!</font>

294
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, this is what I wanted to discuss with you.</font>

295
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I came up with a plan
 after I learned everything from Pekoms.</i></font>

296
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I tried to predict your actions.</i></font>

297
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I figured that if you learned the truth,</font>

298
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you would decide to rescue Sanji and his family.</font>

299
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps it's not fair to Pekoms,
but considering the circumstances,</font>

300
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>should we really
make an enemy of Bege?</i></font>

301
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The tea party begins at 10 a.m.</i></font>

302
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's about five hours from now.</i></font>

303
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The 10 of us need to come up
with a plan in that time frame.</font>

304
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop counting us as a part of this!</font>

305
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn brutes!
I'll let them know what you're up to!</font>

306
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen, Luffy, Bege and his crew have been
 relentlessly preparing for this day.</i></font>

307

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Sanji!</font>

308
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's ally with Bege!</font>

309
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

310
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... you're probably right.</font>

311
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

312
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you insane, Luffy?!</font>

313
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy wants to do this?!</font>

314
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see? I told you he would want to!</font>

315
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, four of our six here are against this!</font>

316
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you care about Bege-<i>san</i>'s ill deeds?!</font>

317
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, this way, everything'll work out, right?</font>

318
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't make a decision like that...</font>

319
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,020

320
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, let's go right now!</font>

321
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

322
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. If something
doesn't feel right, you can refuse!</font>

323
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have a different goal, after all.</font>

441
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. I'm sure she's

442
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,720

443
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom sounded so mad when she talked about

444
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... that was a big deal.</font>

445
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

446
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama is reviled by all giants
in the world for a reason.</font>

447
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the giants in the world?</font>

448
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why even though
Totto Land has a diverse population,</font>

449
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there are no giants.</font>

450
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giants really exist!</font>

451
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One day,</font>

452
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola had a surprise suitor</font>

453
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who claimed it was love at first sight.</font>

454
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was none other than Prince Loki of Elbaf,
 the land of the giants!</font>

455
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A prince?! Amazing!</font>

456
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama practically cried with joy.</font>

457
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She thought if Lola became
the princess of Elbaf,</font>

458
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">her long-standing feud with
the giants would be resolved,</font>

459
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and she'd even gain access to the army of Elbaf,
the country known as the mightiest in the whole world.</font>

460
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

461
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what she ran away from.</font>

462
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It all went downhill from there.</font>

463
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She tried to use me as a substitute,</font>

464
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he noticed that I wasn't Lola.</font>

465
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So her relationship with the giants
got even worse.</font>

466
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, she gave up the idea of
becoming friendly with actual giants</font>

467
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and started investing in research
to gigantify regular humans instead.</font>

468
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her anger toward Lola only worsened,
and she was branded a criminal in this country!</font>

469
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she ever comes back, she'll be killed!</font>

470
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Furthermore, she couldn't stand
looking at me anymore, since I look just like Lola.</font>

471
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Get that damn face out of my sight!</i></font>

472
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When she saw me, she hit me without mercy.
For years, I always had fresh wounds.</font>

473
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was afraid that my own mother would kill me!</font>

474
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see that monster
as my mother anymore!</font>

475
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, Lola is very carefree... She probably has no idea that her mother wants to kill her.</font>

476
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... Everything makes sense now.</font>

477
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So when Bege said he was going to assassinate Mama,
I felt nothing at all.</font>

478
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You might think I'm terrible,
but it's the truth.</font>

479
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, well, that bath felt so good!</font>

480
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, just like heaven!</font>

481
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I refuse to move on to the next life!</font>

482
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This feels like the aftermath of a battle...
I'm getting too relaxed. It hasn't even started yet!</font>

483
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-<i>san</i>, Luffy-<i>san</i>.</font>

484
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's milk in here. Milk!</font>

485
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,130

I lost my tooth.</font>

487
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And my face has been cracked.</font>

488
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for the milk!</font>

489
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All better!</font>

490
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that even possible?!</font>

491
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,560
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="35"><font color="#000000">3 Hours and 30 Minutes

<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="35">3 Hours and 30 Minutes

493
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't forgive you, Chiffon!
I can't believe you!</font>

494
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you help someone
who wants to kill Mama!</font>

495
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mistress Chiffon, please think about this!
You know no one could ever kill Mama!</font>

496
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Sis Brûlée!</font>

497
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know what she's done to me, right?</font>

498
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried about Lola.
Bege and Pez are my only family now!</font>

499
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't need anyone else!</font>

500
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's okay, it's okay.</font>

501
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, everyone's gathered, right?</font>

502
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you cleaned yourselves up a bit?</font>

503
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As the saying goes, "The suit makes the man."</font>

504
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't talk to anyone that doesn't take care of their appearance.</font>

505
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, we've got three and a half hours to go.</font>

506
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's first decide...</font>

507
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if we're working together or not.</font>

508
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're good, aren't they, Luffy?</font>

509
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you guys restrain yourselves?!</font>

510
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? These are for us to eat, right?</font>

511
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From our perspective, you guys are just a nuisance.</font>

512
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The easiest solution would be for us to kill all of you, here and now.</font>

513
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure about that?</font>

514
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I die, you won't have your chance to kill Big Mom.</font>

515
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because the ceremony would be canceled.</font>

516
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm not back two hours before the wedding,
they'll be suspicious.</font>

517
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. I hate to admit it, but you're right.</font>

518
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll keep you alive, in that case.</font>

519
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time to waste on threats.</font>

520
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, how are you feeling about this?
Can you work with them?</font>

521
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think?</font>

522
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Caesar, aren't you?!</font>

523
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Caesar?! Where?!</font>

524
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been here the whole time...</font>

525
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could you not notice...?</font>

526
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This research is so pointless!
I'm not gonna work anymore!</font>

527
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead and do as you like with me, Big Mom!</font>

528
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar Clown!</font>

529
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I-I'm working my butt off!
Tell that to Big Mom!</font>

530
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need.</font>

531
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

532
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I asked them to let me watch over you,
they agreed without a question.</font>

533
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm now a trusted rook!</font>

534
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that my heart?!</font>

535
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm willing to let you go.
If you help me in return, that is...</font>

536
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?!</font>

537
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the genius scientist Caesar Clown! 
I could destroy the world if I wanted to!</font>

538
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know who you are.</font>

539
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I came here.</font>

540
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

541
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I served Big Mom and now Bege!</font>

542
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gotta work anyway!</font>

543
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you doing your job-<i>rero<font size="12"> </font></i></font>?

544
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am! Who do you think I am?!</font>

545
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:35,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is much more to my liking
than what she had me do!</font>

546
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The greatest piece of art
will soon be completed!</font>

547
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's good to know.</font>

548
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat crew will be here shortly-<i>rero</i>.</font>

549
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,530

550
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, come on!
I never wanna see those guys again!</font>

551
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When they're around,
everything goes wrong!</font>

552

00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,380
