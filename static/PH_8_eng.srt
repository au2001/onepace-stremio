00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess... I must have hit my head when we fell.</font>

2
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too, my head hurts quite a bit.</font>

3
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe we lost him.
I wonder if the samurai's still okay.</font>

4
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Says the guy who took us on a massive detour.</font>

5
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of us just followed the path, didn't we?!</font>

6
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sadly we never managed to find
the abominable snowman, even after searching.</font>

7
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'll never forget those shadows I saw.</font>

8
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't the abominable snowman.  Don't get carried away.</font>

9
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said the whole thing
was just an ambush, didn't you?</font>

10
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did not!</font>

11
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'm still not a believer.</font>

12
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe they exist!</font>

13
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe that I need more evidence before I decide.</font>

14
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, that's a very good position to take.</font>

15
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are mature.</font>

16
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I have been alive and dead for many years.</font>

17
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indecision is a sign of weakness.</font>

18
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

19
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  Samurai-san!  Where are you?</i></font>

20
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't you dare hurt Nami's beautiful body!</i></font>

21
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, both of you!  Please come look at this!</i></font>

22
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Footprints!</i></font>

23
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Th-This is...</i></font>

24
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You don't suppose these could be
the footprints of the legendary abominable snowman?!</i></font>

25
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey now, how can you say something so stupid?</i></font>

26
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wow, really?!
Mysterious footprints on a snow covered mountain?!</i></font>

27
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They're huge, aren't they?!  I can't believe it!</i></font>

28
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And they're fresh!</i></font>

29
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If we follow them, then...</i></font>

30
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We'll solve a mystery of the unknown!</i></font>

31
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A dead end?</i></font>

32
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are they?  There are giant shadows behind us!</i></font>

33
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Could it be the abominable-</i></font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc"></font>

34
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's this gas?!</i></font>

35
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It'sh like I'm drunk or somethin...
Shuddenly my tung feelsh all heavy... An' I'm sleeby...</i></font>

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No matter how good your alcohol tolerance is, if you breath in KYP gas...</i></font>

38
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>you will experience a drunken state
and overwhelming drowsiness.</i></font>

39
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And at the bottom of the cliff is zone F-16.</i></font>

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You will not be able to escape the ice spikes!</i></font>

41
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So these three will fall first.</i></font>

42
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Spikes?!</i></font>

43
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, guys!</i></font>

44
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>T-That was close.</i></font>

45
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is zone F-16.  We found the three Straw Hat
pirates exactly where they were reported to be.</i></font>

46
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We'll dispose of the corpses now.</i></font>

47
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who're you calling a corpse?</i></font>

48
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!  She's alive!</i></font>

49
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But it's only one woman against all of us-</i></font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc"></font>

50
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I don't care how many
of you third-rate weaklings there are.</i></font>

51
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's all the same to me!</i></font>

52
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I gotta be careful.</i></font>

53
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>After all, this is the body of the delicate Nami-san.</i></font>

54
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It'd be a crime to leave any scars on it.</i></font>

55
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Forgive me, Nami-san.  Just one cig.</i></font>

56
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now then...</i></font>

57
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Get up, you idiots!</i></font>

58
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, the time
for mysteries of the unknown is over.</font>

59
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, is this the area the samurai went?</font>

60
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

61
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume he's searching for his torso somewhere around the lake.</font>

62
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, we're almost to the lake.</font>

63
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai-san!</font>

64
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Samurai!</font>

65
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out here, Samurai!</font>

66
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai!</font>

67
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you killed in battle?</font>

68
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out here!  You okay?</font>

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai!</font>

70
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you hear me, Samurai-san?!</font>

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really wonder where he went.</font>

72
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think he got his torso
and went off to find that kid of his?</font>

73
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

74
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't this the samurai?!</font>

75
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the... he's frozen!</font>

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey!</font>

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cold!</font>

78
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you okay?</font>

79
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did somebody attack you?</font>

80
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For some unknown reason,
I was frozen and on the verge of meeting my demise!</font>

81
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean you were freezing to death in the blizzard?!</font>

82
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!  I-I-I-It is not even remotely cold!</font>

83
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you're stubborn!</font>

84
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A warrior does not feel cold!</font>

85
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, this guy's a pain.</font>

86
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put some clothes on!</font>

87
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't your power the ability to create clothes?!</font>

88
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Actually, because of that magic, I have a weak point.</font>

89
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't claim to be a strong swimmer...</font>

90
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sink!  Everyone knows that!</font>

91
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So it seems that my torso...</font>

92
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has f-fallen in water.</font>

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In water?</font>

94
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm certain!</font>

95
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can feel that my torso's underwater...</font>

96
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  So that's why you were laying here freezing.</font>

97
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If your body's in the water,
then you can't use your ability.</font>

98
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's in water, then do you think
that maybe it fell in that lake, Brook?</font>

99
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would think so.
I heard that the lake's technically part of the ocean.</font>

100
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he's still alive,</font>

101
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then that means the sharks haven't gotten it yet.</font>

102
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we have no idea what else is in that lake.</font>

103
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd better pull it out as fast as possible.</font>

104
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, let's hurry.</font>

105
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-If it's in the lake... then I'll have to dive for it...</font>

106
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We get it!  You swim like a hammer, right?</font>

107
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bungling samurai.</font>

108
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're pirates, aren't you?!</font>

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you go so far
to help someone you've never met before?</font>

110
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you,
I know the difference between right and wrong!</font>

111
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I wanna settle our fight
after I put you back together!</font>

112
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna give you a beating.</font>

113
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">F-Forgive me.</font>

114
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm indebted to you.</font>

115
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so I see you learned how to express gratitude.</font>

116
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess some people
improve with a little freezing now and again.</font>

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was wondering myself.</font>

119
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-That's...</font>

120
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard-san's underling-taurs,
whom we stripped of clothes!</font>

121
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull yourself together!  You gotta run!</font>

122
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from the lake!</font>

123
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a monster on the other side!</font>

124
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to report it to Master!</font>

125
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where could something like that have been hiding on this island?!</font>

126
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just run!  The monster's coming!</font>

127
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  A monster?  Aren't you guys all monsters?</font>

128
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's those damned thieving pirates from before!</font>

129
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, that's my coat!</font>

130
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the coat!  Run!  Just get back to the laboratory!</font>

131
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys took out the boss!</font>

132
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't forget!</font>

133
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that about?</font>

134
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea.</font>

135
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook.  They were coming
from the direction of the lake, weren't they?</font>

136
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa!  That's right!  You actually got that right!</font>

137
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's amazing, Zoro-san!</font>

138
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why are you looking like that?</font>

139
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I don't quite remember...</font>

140
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there being a mountain there.</font>

141
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm... a mountain?</font>

142
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is that thing?!</font>

143
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smiley <i>is</i> the explosion that destroyed Punk Hazard
four years ago, a living chemical weapon!</font>

144
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they really believe
that I would just destroy all the gas on the island?</font>

145
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

146
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who would waste such a precious thing?</font>

147
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I compressed it and turned it into a monster!</font>

148
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A monster named Smiley!</font>

149
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island was an unlivable hellscape due to what enveloped it!</font>

150
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People can forget such tragedies all too quickly,</font>

151
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it hasn't gone anywhere!</font>

152
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still right here in the palm of my hand!</font>

153
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've captured the ship!</font>

154
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop the ship!</font>

155
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit playing around!  Hurry and wrap it up!</font>

156
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Smoker-san!  How do I change back to normal?</font>

157
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in the way!  Just sit there and be quiet!</font>

158
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you have the door open yet?!</font>

159
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our enemy is inside the lab.</font>

160
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just waste time out here until we die!</font>

161
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!  The door won't budge an inch, Smo-san!</font>

162
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a load of crap.</font>

163
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:51,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only I had my body,
breaking into this place wouldn't be a problem.</font>

164
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your power sure is useful!</font>

165
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did we just teleport?</font>

166
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get into the bag and stay quiet.</font>

167
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're already at the back entrance of the lab.</font>

168
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The main experiment room
will have Caesaro and a woman in it.</font>

169
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get them out of there one way or another.</font>

170
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that happens, you investigate the drugs.</font>

171
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're so strong
and can easily get close to Master.</font>

172
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you just capture him yourself?</font>

173
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I could have all the time in the world
to investigate the drugs.</font>

174
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have my reasons for not doing that.  It's why I need your strength.</font>

175
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway,
the faster you guys can kidnap Caesaro the better.</font>

176
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll take care of the rest.</font>

177
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Look at that!</font>

178
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's flying toward us!</font>

179
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a giant bomb!</font>

180
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's something else!</font>

181
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bam!</font>

182
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Bam!"?  Was that a person?</font>

183
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

184
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a pretty good shortcut!</font>

185
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!  Get out here!</font>

186
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kick your ass and kidnap you!</font>

187
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you're supposed to keep that a secret.</font>

188
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?!</font>

189
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

190
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Luffy!</font>

191
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That idiot.</font>

192
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who told him to take on the entire Navy?</font>

193
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you Master?!  Get out here!</font>

194
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's amazing!  I can hardly believe my eyes.</font>

195
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, wait... I don't have any eyes.</font>

196
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,370
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b><font size="45">Caesar's Laboratory - Main Entrance</font></b></font>

197
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did that bastard just say that he's going to
kick our beloved Master's ass and kidnap him?!</font>

198
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a joke!  Kill the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

199
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got here alright, but where's Master?</font>

200
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I doubt he'd hang around outside.</font>

201
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then where is he?</font>

202
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably inside the lab.</font>

203
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.
Then I guess we have to get through that giant door.</font>

204
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go.</font>

205
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

206
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you plotting on this island?</font>

207
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoke-man!  I'm so glad you're alright!</font>

208
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looked like you took a beating earlier,
so I was worried.</font>

209
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mock me.</font>

210
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Does your stomach hurt?  Are you constipated?</font>

211
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It flew!</font>

212
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with you, Smoke-man?  You've gotten weak.</font>

213
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, that's not it.  I'm...</font>

214
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And besides,
the way you've been talking has been weird, too.</font>

215
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, give me a damn break!</font>

216
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lose to him in my body!</font>

217
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, that weapon!</font>

218
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're back on the seas, huh, Straw Hat?</font>

219
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I won't let you do as you please!</font>

220
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got hit!</font>

221
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right... There's Sea Stone in that thing!</font>

222
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did Four-eyes get this strong?</font>

223
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was her name again?</font>

224
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Smoker!</font>

225
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, this is certainly Law's doing.</font>

226
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, they've swapped bodies.  I see.</font>

227
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder he's so weak.</font>

228
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that means...</font>

229
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're...</font>

230
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoke-man?!</font>

231
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you laughing at?!</font>

232
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fight me, Straw Hat!</font>

233
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't catch him!</font>

234
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our fight will have to wait 'til next time!</font>

235
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?</font>

236
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in fighting
if you aren't at full strength!</font>

237
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cocky bastard!</font>

238
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya later, Smoke-man!</font>

239
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They blew a hole in the door!</font>

240
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is that guy?</font>

241
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was that a laser?!</font>

242
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, Robin!  I busted the door open!  Let's go in!</font>

243
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, you work fast, Franky!</font>

244
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smokey!</font>

245
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something strange is flying toward us!</font>

246
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there!</font>

247
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

248
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What...</font>

249
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is that?</font>

250
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, Franky, wait!</font>

251
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What is that?</font>

252
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's poison gas!  Get back!</font>

253
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you cut or shoot it, then poison gas comes out.</font>

254
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get your gas masks on!  Hurry!</font>

255
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?  What's that?</font>

256
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it alive?</font>

257
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could it possibly be?  I have no idea.</font>

258
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  What the hell is that?</font>

259
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.  I've never seen anything like it.</font>

260
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It fell from the sky, right?</font>

261
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, but it's moving.</font>

262
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, how creepy.</font>

263
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that thing alive?</font>

264
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that!</font>

265
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're merging and growing bigger.</font>

266
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should just push it into the river.</font>

267
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Don't do that!</font>

268
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More poison gas!</font>

269
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull him out!</font>

270
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heave, ho!</font>

271
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh man...</font>

272
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My skin!  It hurts!  Do something!  Anybody!</font>

273
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, get a cloth or something!</font>

274
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew you shouldn't touch it!</font>

275
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do we do?</font>

276
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know!</font>

277
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can fall back!</font>

278
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This thing looks like it'd be weak against fire.</font>

279
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's burn it down!</font>

280
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

281
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

282
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There ain't a creature alive that isn't afraid of fire!</font>

283
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, you're smart.</font>

284
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill it with fire!</font>

285
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew fire would work.  Serves you right!</font>

286
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's starting to burn!  It doesn't like it at all!</font>

287
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My men!</font>

288
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?</font>

289
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No clue.  First time I've ever seen anything like it.</font>

290
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's poisonous to touch, and it blows up if you burn it.</font>

291
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't even tell if it was alive or not!</font>

292
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever it was... it's dead now.</font>

293
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you're right.</font>

294
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what's more,
the explosion took out the marines stealing the ship.</font>

295
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked out pretty good for us!</font>

296
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's back!</i></font>

297
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the sky!</font>

298
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are all the same as the first one?</font>

299
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's so many of them.</font>

300
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're falling like rain!</font>

301
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run away!  And <i>don't</i> </font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc">touch them!</font>

302
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san.  It's too dangerous to stay here.</font>

303
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to find shelter.</font>

304
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a good boy!
I'm sorry I had you locked up for three years.</font>

305
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

306
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you out here?  It's too dangerous!</font>

307
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it.</font>

308
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no doubt about it.  You're Caesar Clown!</font>

309
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you that Master guy?</font>

310
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed I am.</font>

311
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get a good look at me,
Straw Hat Pirate Crew and Navy G-5 division.</font>

312
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the number one scientist in the world!</font>

313
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master Caesar Clown!</font>

314
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be long now.</font>

315
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't like the water...</font>

316
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:38,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so he's launching little pieces of himself over here
so that he can get across the lake.</font>

317
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the Burning Lands to the Frozen Lands!</font>

318
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once every single piece has made it over here...</font>

319
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you will get the full taste of...</font>

320
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the living chemical weapon that <i>is</i> </font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc">the explosion that laid waste to Punk Hazard four years ago.</font>

321
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It turned this island into a landscape of death
where nothing could survive!</font>

322
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that thing alive?</font>

323
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea.  I've never seen anything like it.</font>

324
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mysterious thing...</font>

325
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...doing mysterious things.</font>

326
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gotcha!</font>
