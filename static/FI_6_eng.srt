<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doin-</font>

94
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there an intruder in here?!</font>

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm sorry to have made you worry.  I must have had a nightmare.</font>

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I could have sworn I heard a voice.</font>

97
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and speaking of which,
there is something I must tell you.</font>

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's about the pirate Straw Hat Luffy,
who apparently rescued Megalo earlier.</font>

100
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some mermaids have gone missing,
and we suspect he has kidnapped them.</font>

101
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:40,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, due to a prediction by Madame Shyarly, we've decided to confine the Straw Hats to the dungeon,</font>

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as there is a good chance that they will cause trouble in the future.</font>

103
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The swordsman who came
to Ryuuguu Palace a little while ago...</font>

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">fell asleep after drinking too much,
and we have already placed him under arrest.</font>

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three members of Straw Hat's crew who arrived just now have probably been captured too.</font>

106
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, their captain, Straw Hat, who came here with them must have realized what was going on...</font>

107
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and somehow, he's disappeared.</font>

108
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We believe he may be lurking
somewhere in the castle, so please be careful.</font>

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will also make sure we capture
the rest of his crewmates on the island.</font>

110
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will protect the country's peace at all costs!</font>

111
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, in any case, it's really quite a shame that we had to restrain Megalo's saviors.</font>

112
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right... It has already been five minutes.</font>

113
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will be leaving now.</font>

114
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you so much.</font>

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really was quite rude to you earlier.</font>

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, forgive me.</font>

117
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know you were the one who saved Megalo's life.</font>

118
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I call you Luffy-sama?</font>

119
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

120
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, since you are a pirate...</font>

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">does that mean you are a bad person?</font>

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.  Decide that for yourself.</font>

123
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But what about your crewmates?
They've been captured by our guards.</font>

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's alright.  There's no way you guys could actually capture them.</font>

125
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so?</font>

126
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, never mind that.  What was with that axe?</font>

127
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of superman could have thrown that, and from where?</font>

128
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know... who did it.</font>

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a man named Vander Decken-sama.</font>

130
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it to get revenge, since I refused to marry him.</font>

131
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man...</font>

132
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The devil placed the curse of "Target" on him.</font>

133
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of this, he's capable of...</font>

134
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">targeting my life from anywhere at any time,
since he has set me as his target.</font>

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why it's dangerous for me to go outside.</font>

136
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not even allowed to take a single step outside Hard-Shell Tower. </font>

137
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has been doing it for ten years.</font>

138
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years?!</font>

139
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Must be really boring.</font>

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And on top of that, my father has decided that the guards can only be in here...</font>

141
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for five minutes at a time.    </font>

142
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

143
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And so, Megalo is the only one I can talk to.</font>

144
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a valuable friend of mine.</font>

145
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's why they wanted
to hold a feast just for saving him.</font>

146
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That kinda got ruined, though.</font>

147
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regardless of that, you humans certainly do eat a lot for your size.</font>

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shaggy old guy...</font>

149
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">said we'd have a feast...</font>

150
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he just kept getting yelled at for so long.</font>

151
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't wait any longer...</font>

152
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I came here, following the smell.</font>

153
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, they called you "Princess", right?</font>

154
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

155
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're the Mermaid Princess?</font>

156
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.  I am the daughter of King Neptune.</font>

157
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Shirahoshi.</font>

158
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Shirasu?</font>

159
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Shirahoshi.</font>

160
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh... That's really hard to say.</font>

161
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  I want to taste that too!</font>

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't seem like a bad person to me at all.</font>

163
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you are a pirate,
have you gone on adventures and such?</font>

164
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

165
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right.  And have you seen the sun?</font>

166
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When night falls, one can see stars floating in the sky, right?</font>

167
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there are many different kinds of flowers, and animals with fur all over their bodies!</font>

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you ever been to a green place called the "forest"?</font>

169
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, wait!
You're asking too many questions!  Wait a second! </font>

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright. </font>

171
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, what large cheeks you have.</font>

172
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are you doing?!  Stop that!</i></font>

173
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-O-Oh no...</font>

174
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't yell at me so loudly.</font>

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama... You really are scary... after all.</font>

176
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Why are you crying?  Cut it out!</font>

177
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody has ever... scolded me before.</font>

178
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you're so huge,
you're just a weakling and a crybaby, aren't you?</font>

179
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like you!</font>

180
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an awful thing to say.</font>

181
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody has ever said such a thing to me.</font>

182
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are just awful... Please leave.</font>

183
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't take this anymore!</font>

185
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm stuffed!</font>

186
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for the food!</font>

187
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been in here for ten years, huh?  I'd probably get ill from that.</font>

188
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama... Please leave now.</font>

189
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say...</font>

190
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there anywhere you wanna go?</font>

191
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course... There are many places.</font>

192
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd bet there are.</font>

193
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then let's get out of here!</font>

194
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

195
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go for a walk!</font>

196
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wait!  I can't do that.</font>

197
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with you?  Let's go!</font>

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be alright!</font>

199
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything else comes flying at you,
I'll just blow it all away!</font>

200
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

201
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp-chin!  Nami-chin!  Brook-chin!</font>

202
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,850
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ryuuguu Palace
Main Entrance</font>

203
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you even restrain them?!</font>

204
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just three humans!</font>

205
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are you doing?!</font>

206
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, if you keep fighting them,
you really will be considered criminals!</font>

207
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be that as it may, we don't have a good reason to just quietly accept this either, Caimie-san.</font>

208
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was really looking forward to the feast at Ryuuguu Palace, too.</font>

209
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't fight back, we'll be captured.</font>

210
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were the ones who turned against us for some incomprehensible reason!</font>

211
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can take on as many of you as you like, if you so desire.</font>

212
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're this strong, even without their captain!</font>

213
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-They're too powerful!</font>

214
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever we may or may not do in the future...</font>

215
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you honestly think
we'll let you arrest us for it now?!</font>

216
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was the guy with the nose always this reliable?!</font>

217
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?!  This is just the prologue to the future that was foretold!</font>

218
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look who's talking!</font>

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you hadn't attacked us,
we'd have no reason to fight you!</font>

220
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, these guys aren't anywhere near as tough as the giant insects on the Boin Islands!</font>

221
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold the power of my new weapon,
the Black Kabuto!</font>

222
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come at me from wherever you want!</font>

223
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama, please help us!</font>

224
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really alright to arrest someone due to a prophecy?</font>

225
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like some time to think about it -jamon!</font>

226
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Therefore I would like you to allow yourselves to be captured for the time being!</font>

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is quite a formidable foe!</font>

228
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro?!</font>

229
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you were in a prison cell?!</font>

230
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard the festival music...</font>

231
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I came here!</font>

232
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait right there, Wadatsumi.</font>

233
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,720
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Fishman District, "Noah"</font>

234
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, understood.</font>

235
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken-sama has arrived!</font>

236
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right this way.</font>

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon the delay.</font>

238
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ran into a volcanic eruption on the way.</font>

239
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you the owner of this place?  The infamous Hody,</font>

240
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume?</font>

241
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as infamous as you are.</font>

242
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crazy Vander Decken.</font>

243
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Glad to be working with you.</font>

244
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, a handshake?</font>

245
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a problem.  Wait a second.</font>

246
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This'll do.</font>

247
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, don't worry about it!</font>

248
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pleasure's all mine.</font>

249
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice to meet ya, Hody Jones.</font>

250
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, nobody on the ocean floor can oppose us.</font>

251
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the dangerous guys are gathered here!</font>

252
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Decken!  Decken!</i></font>

253
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hody!  Hody!</i></font>

254
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune is a nuisance for both of us.</font>

255
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We both share the same objectives.</font>

256
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To crush the Neptune Army, who have neither the pride of fishmen nor merfolk.</font>

257
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To take the head of Sea God Neptune.</font>

258
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And...</font>

259
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to bring Ryuuguu Kingdom...</font>

260
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>to ruin!</i></font>

261
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What have you guys done?!</font>

262
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really,</font>

263
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you went way too far!</font>

264
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!  Apologize for your actions!</font>

265
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were the ones who started this fight!  We're all in this together, you idiots!</font>

266
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just wanted to threaten them and run away!</font>

267
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I just wanted to go sightseeing and shopping.</font>

268
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's in the past now, so what can we do?</font>

269
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't complain!</font>

270
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"What can we do"?!  You think that's good enough?!</font>

271
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just dropping by Fishman Island and then casually occupying Ryuuguu Palace...</font>

272
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How ruthless can you get?!</font>

273
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow...</font>

274
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So should we just have let them arrest us?!</font>

275
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I keep telling you, we should have just threatened them and fled!</font>

276
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First off, we don't know how we could escape.  Second, Luffy's not here!</font>

277
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right, Luffy's gone!</font>

278
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did he go?</font>

279
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where indeed?</font>

280
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really in a hurry here.
So don't be mean, and just tell us.</font>

281
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we need to find Luffy!</font>

282
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the treasure chamber?</font>

283
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cut it out!</i></font>

284
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Why?</font>

285
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why are you acting all innocent?!  Consider our situation!</i></font>

286
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, everyone!</font>

287
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this difficult time, let's sing a song and be happy!</font>

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on!</font>

289
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll work out somehow, it'll work out somehow.</font>

290
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And even if it doesn't, we'll die someday anyway!</font>

291
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

292
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shut up too, Soul King!</font>

293
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama, are you alright?!</font>

294
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe that the champion of the sea, King Neptune, would end up like this.</font>

295
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My bad hip acted up
all of a sudden, so I couldn't fight.</font>

296
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've really gotten old.</font>

297
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite a blunder -jamon!</font>

298
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry!</font>

299
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should have moved quickly and burst their bubble,
turning it into an underwater fight,</font>

300
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they managed to get rid of all the water instead!</font>

301
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, you scum!</font>

302
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once the three brothers of the Neptune Army, Prince Fukaboshi, Prince Ryuuboshi,</font>

303
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and Prince Manboshi get back here,</font>

304
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're going to regret this!</font>

305
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, we can't stay on Fishman Island any longer.</font>

306
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the Sunny?
We need to gather everyone up and set sail.</font>

307
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the Sunny's coating was torn off
as we entered the island.</font>

308
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Log Pose has been acting strange too.</font>

309
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since we came here,
it hasn't shown any sign of stabilizing.</font>

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're hopeless.  You can't navigate
the New World with such a simple Pose.</font>

311
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ignorant pirates.</font>

312
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  This won't work?</font>

313
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

314
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you if you untie me.</font>

315
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That must be Prince Fukaboshi!</font>

316
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Akkamanbo!  Yay!  Yay!</font>

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?  How peculiar.</font>

318
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could the guards be doing?</font>

319
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, who is this? </font>

320
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Why are <i>you</i> answering?!</font>

321
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi!</font>

322
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help us!</font>

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet, you two!</font>

324
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Ryuuboshi!</font>

325
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Manboshi!</font>

326
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my!  Brother, something
must have happened -la-ti-do!</font>

327
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think so too!  Are Father and Shirahoshi alright?!</font>

328
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, Fukaboshi.  What is going on in there?</font>

329
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lower the connecting channel right now, and let us in.</font>

330
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what will happen if we do that?</font>

331
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No can do!</font>

332
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey!  What are you saying?!</font>

333
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Explain the situation to them!</font>

334
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  In that case, tie me and Caimie up too!</font>

335
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't want to be seen as your partners in crime!</font>

336
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-chin, you're scaring me!</font>

337
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you, by any chance, one of Straw Hat's companions?</font>

338
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi!  He's the swordsman with the three swords from the Straw Hat Crew...</font>

339
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate Hunter Zori!</font>

340
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Zoro!</font>

341
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father?!</font>

342
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You hear that?  We've got plenty of hostages, including Neptune!</font>

343
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want them to live,
then start making preparations for us to set sail!</font>

344
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What we'll need is our ship, the Sunny, re-coated.</font>

345
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know where it is, so you guys find it.</font>

346
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, the rest of our crew.</font>

347
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One gloomy woman.  One robot.</font>

348
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One raccoon dog, and one pervy water imp.</font>

349
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Zoro!  1,000,000,000 belly, too.</font>

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out, damn it!</font>

351
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pervy water imp!  How fitting!</font>

352
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That fits him perfectly!</font>

353
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is no time to be laughing!</i></font>

354
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pervy water imp!</font>

355
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on!  At least make a jab at the "gloomy woman" comment too!</font>

356
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand your conditions.</font>

357
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will make arrangements for you and your crew
to leave this kingdom safely.</font>

358
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, you must return all of the hostages unharmed!</font>

359
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Brother!</i></font>

360
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no other choice.</font>

361
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The connecting channel is the only way
into Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

362
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everywhere else, it's protected by a thick bubble layer
that we can't break through.</font>

363
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I say one more thing, Zoro-kun?</font>

364
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather not tell you in this situation,</font>

365
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I cannot dishonor my debt to Jinbe.</font>

366
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the former Royal Warlord of the Sea, Sea Knight Jinbe, to Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

367
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted me to tell you this once you reached the island.</font>

368
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have two messages to pass on.</font>

369
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, huh?</font>

370
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe?!</font>

371
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe.</font>

372
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, he did say that he was friends with Jinbe.</font>

373
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Despite being a pirate, he's an amazing man who everyone on the island trusts.</font>

374
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy isn't here right now, but I'll pass the message on to him.</font>

375
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say it.</font>

376
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The first message is...</font>

377
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Don't fight Hody."</font>

378
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The second one is...</font>

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."</font>

380
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is all.</font>

381
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sea Forest... Hody...</font>

382
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,200
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Fishman Island
Coral Hill</font>

383
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They really did it!</font>

384
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently the Straw Hat Pirates have occupied Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

385
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

386
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's their objective?!</font>

387
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  And they seemed like such nice people.</font>

388
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could they?</font>

389
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnapping the girls from the bay,
and considering the future that was predicted...</font>

390
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has to be them!
Things are progressing in that direction!</font>

391
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've finally shown their true colors!</font>

392
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently two of Straw Hat's companions are in the back room of the Mermaid Café.</font>

393
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards just went to capture them.</font>

394
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kung Fu Point!</font>

395
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji is still recovering!  Don't touch him!</font>

396
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean "come to Ryuuguu Palace"?!  You're just planning to arrest us, aren't you?!</font>

397
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... you guys...</font>

398
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!  You mustn't move around yet!</font>

399
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, will she be at that Ryuuguu Palace place?</font>

400
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm talking about the Mermaid Princess!</font>

401
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-She's there, but what about it?</font>

402
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll go. Even if it may kill me.</font>

403
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're going?! Haven't you learned yet?!</font>

404
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she's a beauty, you'll die instantly!</font>

405
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,540
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ryuuguu Palace
"Hard-Shell Tower"</font>

406
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Are you done thinking yet?</font>

407
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go outside!</font>

408
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really... can't.</font>

409
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why not?!  You said there were places you wanted to go, right?</font>

410
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if I do something so selfish,</font>

411
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be causing trouble for everyone in the castle.</font>

412
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'd been locked up in here for ten years,
I'd have gone crazy.</font>

413
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is to thank you for the food.</font>

414
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be there with you, so where do you want to go?</font>

415
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

416
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sea Forest!</font>

417
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, but...</font>

418
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that's just a dream.</font>

419
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't possibly do something
as selfish as breaking out of here.</font>

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you starting to cry just from saying where you want to go?!</font>

421
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm sorry.</font>

422
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to gather up so much courage just to say it.</font>

423
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please don't be mad at me!</font>

424
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're scary, Luffy-sama!</font>

425
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a pain!</font>

426
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  What was that loud noise?!</font>

427
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he throwing something at us again?</font>

428
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a rude guy.</font>

429
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

430
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is that sound -jamon?</font>

431
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be Decken's doing?!</font>

432
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's coming from Hard-Shell Tower -jamon!
S-S-Shirahoshi is in danger!</font>

433
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Are the guards with her?!</font>

434
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they're all tied up here!</font>

435
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, pirates!</font>

436
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go and ensure the princess' safety in place of the guards!</font>

437
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What're you talking about?</font>

438
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Neptune-sama!
That means letting them know about the princess!</font>

439
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What choice do we have?!</font>

440
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hard-Shell Tower is on the northeast side of the palace!</font>

441
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you, go there right now!</font>

442
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do we have to take orders from our hostage?</font>

443
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!  Shirahoshi is my only daughter!</font>

444
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For that reason, she's constantly being targeted!</font>

445
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything happens to my daughter, I will drive you into the bottom of the deep sea!</font>

446
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So basically, she is the Mermaid Princess?  Am I right?</font>

447
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If so, I shall go to her as soon as I can!</font>

448
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then...</font>

449
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if she will show me her panties?</font>

450
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, Brook!</font>

451
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, what are we to do?!
He dashed off with indecent motives!</font>

452
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now the princess is in danger
for an entirely different reason!</font>

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, skeleton!</font>

454
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can keep me tied up, but please take me with you!</font>

455
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hard-Shell Tower is under my jurisdiction.</font>

456
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything happens to the princess,
I will never be at peace.  Even in death!</font>

457
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

458
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">must...</font>

459
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">really love her, right?</font>

460
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't be absurd!</i></font>

461
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How shameless!</i></font>

462
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No!</i></font>

463
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san, I will be going there first if you don't mind!</font>

464
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've always wanted to go to the Sea Forest.</font>

465
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All this time, throughout these past ten years.</font>

466
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... everyone warns me that
it's too dangerous to leave the tower.</font>

467
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm scared of going outside.</font>

468
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, will you really take me there?</font>

469
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

470
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you really protect me?</font>

471
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!  It'll be fine!</font>

472
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  If you're gonna cry, then I won't take you anywhere!</font>

473
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, to be honest, it's more like you'll be taking me there.</font>

474
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't swim, after all.</font>

475
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm so sorry.  I'm just too happy.</font>

476
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are a crybaby, huh?</font>

477
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And a weakling.</font>

478
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we go outside, you'll stand out so much that you'll get spotted right away.</font>

479
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right... I'm so sorry.</font>

480
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I have an idea to deal with that!</font>

481
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaid Princess!  Are you alright?</font>

482
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton!  Look at the side of the tower!</font>

483
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

484
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's insane!  Those aren't the usual knives or axes that come flying!</font>

485
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sound was human pirates crashing into the tower!</font>

486
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How bizarre!</font>

487
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Vander Decken is insane!</font>

488
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  V-Vander Decken?!</font>

489
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't good!  They're getting up!</font>

490
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This means... Enemy soldiers have invaded the impenetrable Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

491
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a sneak attack!  The king is in danger!</font>

492
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The princess is in danger!</font>

493
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sounds of the attacks have stopped, right?</font>

494
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, weakling!</font>

495
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes!</font>

496
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm counting on you, Megalo!</font>

497
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go, shark!</i></font>

498
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Megalo!</i></font>

499
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy-san!</i></font>

500
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sea Forest!</font>
