<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see what's in front of me.</font>

140
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move!</font>

141
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move!</font>

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghost Rap...</font>

143
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this...?</font>

144
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's shameful...</font>

145
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought that woman was weaker than me!</font>

146
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bear!</font>

147
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful,</font>

148
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kumashi's strength exceeds that of a common bear.</font>

149
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this...?!</font>

150
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one in the crew could stand up against that woman's ability...!</font>

151
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was supposed to be someone only I could defeat...!</font>

152
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You can't...</i></font>

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You can't expect to beat her with your inferior abilities.</i></font>

154
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was supposed to be my chance... but look at me...!</font>

155
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use...</font>

156
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no chance to win!</font>

158
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm defeated here, she'll go capture Luffy and the others, then the crew will be finished...</font>

159
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Saving them was a heavier burden than I thought...!</font>

160
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me...</font>

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me...!</font>

162
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sogeking!</font>

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please show me!</font>

164
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What would you do?!</font>

165
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,250
<font face="impress bt" size="43">Oh, the wind carries my name</font>

166
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,100
<font face="impress bt" size="43">from Sniper Island far away.</font>

167
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kumashi!</font>

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,600
<font face="impress bt" size="43">When I take aim, it is straight and true,</font>

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! How dare you hurt my Kumashi..!</font>

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
<font face="impress bt" size="43">lu lu la la lu.</font>

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that stupid mask?!</font>

173
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,750
<font face="impress bt" size="43">Whether you're a man or a mouse:</font>

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,200
<font face="impress bt" size="43">Lock on!</font>

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,950
<font face="impress bt" size="43">I will put your heart in my sights,</font>

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing stupid about it!</font>

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,300
<font face="impress bt" size="43">Lock on!!</font>

178
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pleased to meet you!</font>

179
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Sogeking!</font>

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,070
<font face="impress bt" size="43">The man who came from the Sniper Island...</font>

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't take me for a fool!</font>

182
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You expect me to believe you're someone else?!</font>

183
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to run!</font>

184
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now you run?!</font>

185
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,650
<font face="impress bt" size="43">Lu lu lu lu lu la la!</font>

186
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down!</font>

187
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fight, Usopp-kun!</font>

188
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

189
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

190
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't win at all!</font>

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not true!</font>

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the only man who can do it!</font>

193
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you even have a basis to support that?!</font>

194
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

195
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you don't!</font>

196
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mini Hollow!</font>

197
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just think for a second.</font>

198
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's definitely something suspicious about that woman.</font>

199
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's for sure...</font>

200
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman became so confident all of a sudden.</font>

201
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At first she was afraid of me and ran away.</font>

202
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she was immune to my attacks, then she wouldn't need to run.</font>

203
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She could have flown or gone through walls.</font>

204
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she was crying while running away instead.</font>

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rap!</font>

206
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rap!</font>

207
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The moment I lost track of that woman...</font>

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something happened...</font>

209
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when I was dealing with the bear...</font>

210
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's when I lost sight of her... for a moment.</font>

211
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, it's about time I take you to Moriah-sama.</font>

212
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it!</font>

213
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've solved it...!</font>

214
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are there any suspicious places nearby...?</font>

215
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like a secret room...</font>

216
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your trick!</font>

217
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that? Your last words?</font>

218
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

219
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you aiming?!</font>

220
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it!</font>

221
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait!</font>

222
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly Atlas Meteor!</font>

223
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've found it!</font>

224
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's your real body!</font>

225
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're capable of flying,</font>

226
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">going through walls and people...</font>

227
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">changing from big to small as you please...</font>

228
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that means your body is that of a ghost!</font>

229
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when I think of how you ran from me earlier...</font>

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stay away!</i></font>

231
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At that time you were in your physical body!</font>

232
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do yo-</font>

233
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means!</font>

234
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The person before me...</font>

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is merely a ghost you created while I took my eyes off you.</font>

236
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've kept your body concealed in there!</font>

237
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't hide the truth anymore!</font>

238
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you were just a negative idiot...</font>

239
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you draw courage from that stupid mask?</font>

240
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm surprised you could figure it out.</font>

241
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're only 90% right...</font>

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a ghost that can be controlled by my body...</font>

243
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I become separated from it through Astral Travel.</font>

244
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A hollow that can think and act for itself.</font>

245
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!</font>

246
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, without a body to return to,</font>

247
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what will happen to you...</font>

248
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure you'd tell me not to attack it, right?</font>

249
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard! Stop!</font>

250
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly...</font>

251
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great Explosion Star!</font>

252
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close...</font>

253
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You missed, though it was a dud.</font>

254
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One more shot!</font>

255
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'd let you!</font>

256
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Special Hollow!</font>

257
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this a...?!</font>

258
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mini Hollow...</font>

259
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Extra-large version of those things?!</font>

260
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

261
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me, bastard!</font>

262
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Struggle for a while.</font>

263
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you touch my real body.</font>

264
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a sec!</font>

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those dumpling-sized ghosts already caused insane damage!</font>

266
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If this insanely huge thing explodes, my body'll be blown to pieces!</font>

267
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Struggle all you want, you can't touch it...</font>

268
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a ghost.</font>

269
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go!</font>

270
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me, damn it!</font>

271
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame, Nega-nose.</font>

272
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I snap my fingers, your body will be blown to pieces.</font>

273
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kamikaze Rap!</font>

274
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It disappeared?!</font>

275
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't a dud...</font>

282
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was my Sticky Substance.</font>

283
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,410

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd kill me, hey!</font>

317
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take the cockroaches away!</font>
