<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

138
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again with that ridiculous nonsense!</font>

139
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You zombies only exist to be loyal!</font>

140
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly, help me!</font>

141
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're nothing but a pretty face!</font>

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You worthless corpse!</font>

143
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hurry up, Cindry!</font>

144
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars is here!</font>

145
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars, look down, you fool!</font>

146
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, you ungrateful idiot!</font>

147
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who fixed your body so you could move again!</font>

148
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,300
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Nearby, in the corridor outside Perona's room</font>

149
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-Wait a minute!</font>

150
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's going on?!</font>

151
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These tremors are completely different!</font>

152
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lu-Lu-Lu...!</font>

153
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's zombie!</font>

154
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,450
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Nearby, in the church</font>

155
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, hey, hey! What's with this shaking?!</font>

156
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

157
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's zombie?!</font>

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

159
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, this isn't the time to be sleeping!</font>

160
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be helped...</font>

161
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to escape.</font>

162
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san?</font>

163
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san disappeared.</font>

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me...!</font>

165
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tables have turned...</font>

166
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're still conscious?!</font>

168
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You beast-man, show yourself!</font>

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems this demon has finally become our servant!</font>

170
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Checkmate!</font>

171
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time the bride is mine!</font>

172
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

173
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back Nami-san!</font>

174
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you hiding?!</font>

175
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope you have fun with the ultimate zombie!</font>

176
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something came out!</font>

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That's...</font>

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A zombie!</font>

179
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Luffy's zombie.</font>

180
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look over there!</font>

181
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who came out...!</font>

182
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that the curly cook?!</font>

183
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

184
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

185
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that stupid cook doing in there?!</font>

186
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

187
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah!</font>

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you'd rather keep chasing me?</font>

189
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That huge copy bothers me, but...</font>

190
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I want to recover everyone's shadows, I gotta beat the hell out of Moriah!</font>

191
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not getting away!</font>

192
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,890
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Church</font>

193
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

194
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is I who has the last laugh!</font>

195
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem to be deep asleep still...</font>

196
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll find us a new place...</font>

197
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we shall have our wedding once again.</font>

198
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My silent bride.</font>

199
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Perona-sama okay?!</font>

200
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She has lost consciousness.</font>

201
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems she's not injured.</font>

202
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Commander Kumashi and the Vice-Commander are both wiped out.</font>

203
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That long-nose bastard!</font>

204
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get her outta here.</font>

205
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This mansion is so damn dangerous!</font>

206
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The special zombie will take revenge for us!</font>

207
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from the mansion!</font>

208
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The special zombie is fighting!</font>

209
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so damn huge!</font>

210
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see his head towering over the mansion!</font>

211
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,030
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Perona's Wonder Garden</font>

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

213
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

214
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-We're in trouble!</font>

216
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A-Attached to Luffy's zombie's arm are...!</font>

217
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-O-Our...!</font>

218
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanted posters!</font>

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is...</font>

220
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely after us!</font>

221
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show yourselves!</font>

222
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

223
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard...!</font>

224
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now he's getting in our way!</font>

225
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Luffy!</font>

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he really intend to destroy his own crew?!</font>

227
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was surely ordered to.</font>

228
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if the real Luffy is alright...</font>

229
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that thing?!</font>

230
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can we really beat such a monster?!</font>

231
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Interesting.</font>

232
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Moriah!</font>

233
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dead end.</font>

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While you're here, all of your crewmates are becoming victims of your own power, Straw Hat!</font>

235
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

236
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a scary face!</font>

237
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

238
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Usopp! Is that you over there?!</font>

239
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

240
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing on the roof?!</font>

241
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, Brook, you two are alright!</font>

242
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Step aside!</font>

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you getting in our way, Luffy?</font>

244
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...?</font>

245
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is... my enemy.</font>

246
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Oars.</font>

247
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pleased to meet you!</font>

248
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is provoking that monster.</font>

249
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That stupid cook...</font>

250
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he manage to save Nami at least?</font>

251
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shouldn't you be more worried about yourself than the girl right now?</font>

252
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

253
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji's in danger!</font>

254
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is unexpected.</font>

255
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought they were merely after our shadows.</font>

256
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe we caused a little too much trouble.</font>

257
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems they were only after Luffy's shadow.</font>

258
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary.</font>

259
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So scary!</font>

260
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't win against such a monster!</font>

261
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your face resembles the one in this poster.</font>

262
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're one of the pirates.</font>

263
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

264
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's technique!</font>

265
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he going to stretch?!</font>

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he also a rubberman?!</font>

267
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scythe!</font>

268
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't stretch, but...!</font>

269
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With that range and destructive power, there's no need!</font>

270
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars...</font>

271
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard that name before...</font>

272
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he the demon Oars, the legendary "Nation Snatcher"?</font>

273
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Collier Frit!</font>

274
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Fried Neck</i></font>

275
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,360
