1
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,850
<font size="48">Then take me on your
next voyage, Shanks!</font>

2
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,180
<font size="48">I wanna be a pirate too!</font>

3
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,150
<font size="48">As if you could
ever be a pirate!</font>

4
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,190
<font size="48">As if you could
ever be a pirate!</font>

5
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,810
<font size="48">Why not?!</font>

6
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,050
<font size="48">Luffy.</font>

7
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,060
<font size="48">Just bein' a good swimmer doesn't
mean you'd make a good pirate.</font>

8
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,790
<font size="48">I'm good at fighting too!
My punches are like pistols!</font>

9
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,060
<font size="48">Oh, really?</font>

10
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,900
<font size="48">What's that mean?!</font>

11
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,530
<font size="48">He means you're too much
of a kid, Luffy!</font>

12
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,040
<font size="48">Seriously, you're as old
as my own kid!</font>

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,370
<font size="48">I'm not a kid!
I'm a grownup!</font>

14
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,210
<font size="48">Now, now.
Don't get so mad.</font>

15
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,770
<font size="48">Here! Have some juice!</font>

16
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,610
<font size="48">Wow! Thanks!</font>

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,950
<font size="48"><i>--See, you are a kid! Ha!
--That wasn't fair, Shanks!</i></font>

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,690
<font size="48">Don't laugh!</font>

19
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,350
<font size="48">Stupid cheapskate Shanks!</font>

20
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,540
<font size="48">Pardon us.</font>

21
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,980
<font size="48"><i>Oh... So these are "pirates".</i></font>

22
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,310
<font size="48">Look pretty damn dumb.</font>

23
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,880
<font size="48">Welcome...</font>

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
<font size="48">We're mountain bandits.</font>

25
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,020
<font size="48">But we ain't here
to tear up the place.</font>

26
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,020
<font size="48">Sell us some booze.
10 barrels oughta do.</font>

27
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,830
<font size="48">I'm sorry.
I just ran out of alcohol.</font>

28
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,360
<font size="48">That's odd.</font>

29
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,230
<font size="48">These pirates seem to be drinking
something... What is it, water?</font>

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,740
<font size="48">No, what they're drinking
is the last of it.</font>

31
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,270
<font size="48">My apologies. Looks like we
drank the whole place dry.</font>

32
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,940
<font size="48">My apologies. Looks like we
drank the whole place dry.</font>

33
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,740
<font size="48">Sorry!</font>

34
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,410
<font size="48">You can have this, if you'd like.
It hasn't been opened yet.</font>

35
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,810
<font size="48">There's an 8 million Berry
bounty on my head, you know.</font>

36
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,580
<font size="48">One bottle ain't even enough for
a bedtime drink! Don't insult me!</font>

37
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,190
<font size="48">Now the floor's all wet.</font>

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,490
<font size="48"><i>Sorry about that, Makino-san.
Do you have a rag?</i></font>

39
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,830
<font size="48">Oh, I'll do that!</font>

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,100
<font size="48">Seems you like to clean.</font>

41
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,110
<font size="48"><i>Then maybe you'll find
this more fulfilling.</i></font>

42
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,550
<font size="48">Not worth our time if they're
out of booze. Let's go!</font>

43
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,340
<font size="48">Later, wimps!</font>

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,090
<font size="48">Are you all right, Captain?
Are you hurt?!</font>

45
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,580
<font size="48">Oh, I'm fine.
No problem at all.</font>

46
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,940
<font size="48">--He got you good, boss!
--Talk about lame!</font>

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,820
<font size="48">Why are you laughing?!</font>

48
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,650
<font size="48">That was so uncool!</font>

49
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,020
<font size="48">Why didn't you fight them?!</font>

50
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,460
<font size="48">No matter how many there are
or how strong they seem,</font>

51
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,230
<font size="48"><i>you're not men -or pirates -</i></font>

52
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,010
<font size="48">if you laugh after
something like that!</font>

53
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,430
<font size="48">if you laugh after
something like that!</font>

54
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,750
<font size="48">I can understand
how you feel,</font>

55
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,750
<font size="48">but he only spilled
some booze on me.</font>

56
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,820
<font size="48">It's nothing worth
getting mad over.</font>

57
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,480
<font size="48">Whatever!</font>

58
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,820
<font size="48">--Eating out of frustration, Luffy?
--Shut up!</font>

59
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,860
<font size="48">Wait, what're you eating?!</font>

60
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,770
<font size="48">That box! Did you eat what
was in that box?!</font>

61
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,940
<font size="48">Y-yeah...</font>

62
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,510
<font size="48">Spit it out! Right now!
Every last bite!</font>

63
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,910
<font size="48">W-what're you doing, Shanks?!</font>

64
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,630
<font size="48">What... was that?</font>

65
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,330
<font size="48">What you ate was
the Gum-Gum Fruit!</font>

66
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,330
<font size="48">The Gum-Gum Fruit is known
as a Devil Fruit!</font>

67
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,200
<font size="48">Eating it turns your
body to rubber,</font>

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,010
<font size="48">and makes you lose the ability to
swim for the rest of your life!</font>

69
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,540
<font size="48">Eh?! No way!</font>

70
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,530
<font size="48">You dumbass!</font>

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,480
<font size="48">People were drinkin'
and havin' a nice time.</font>

72
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,980
<font size="48">What's the idea, boy?</font>

73
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,320
<font size="48">Dammit! Apologize!</font>

74
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,650
<font size="48">How dare you make fun of
Shanks and his crew!</font>

75
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,830
<font size="48">Did I say something
to offend you?</font>

76
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,520
<font size="48">You did! Now apologize!</font>

77
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,460
<font size="48">Mayor!</font>

78
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,840
<font size="48">You see the looks
on those pirates' faces?!</font>

79
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,740
<font size="48">He got covered in booze
but didn't say a word!</font>

80
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,940
<font size="48">Talk about pathetic!</font>

81
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,450
<font size="48">Pirates are just
a bunch of wimps.</font>

82
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,910
<font size="48">They're nothing
but talk.</font>

83
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,780
<font size="48">Stop it!</font>

84
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,020
<font size="48">Stop making fun of Shanks
and the others!</font>

85
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,350
<font size="48"><i>They are not wimps!</i></font>

86
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,020
<font size="48">Stop, Luffy!</font>

87
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,030
<font size="48">Stop making fun of Shanks and the others!
You stupid bandits!</font>

88
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,470
<font size="48">You oughta watch
your mouth, boy.</font>

89
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,240
<font size="48">No one who's ever made me
mad has lived to tell the tale.</font>

90
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,940
<font size="48">Wait!</font>

91
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,710
<font size="48">Let the boy go! Please!</font>

92
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,950
<font size="48">I don't know what
Luffy has done,</font>

93
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,820
<font size="48">nor do I intend
to fight with you!</font>

94
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,050
<font size="48">If you're not offended,
I'll even pay you!</font>

95
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,190
<font size="48">Just, please!
Spare the boy's life!</font>

96
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,960
<font size="48">Mayor!</font>

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,990
<font size="48">Leave it to senior citizens
to know how the world works.</font>

98
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,360
<font size="48">But no, it's too late
for him now.</font>

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,300
<font size="48">After all, he's made me angry...</font>

100
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
<font size="48"><i>You're the bad guys!
You mountain apes!</i></font>

101
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
<font size="48">You're a lost cause, kid.</font>

102
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,780
<font size="48">You can regret all this
in the next life!</font>

103
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,180
<font size="48">--Luffy!
--Please! Let him go!</font>

104
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,210
<font size="48"><i>I was wondering why
the bar was empty...</i></font>

105
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,690
<font size="48">...looks like it's those
mountain bandits from before.</font>

106
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,350
<font size="48">Captain!</font>

107
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,450
<font size="48">Shanks!</font>

108
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,310
<font size="48">So you pirates
are still here, huh?</font>

109
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,820
<font size="48">Have you been scrubbing the
village clean this whole time?</font>

110
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,080
<font size="48">Luffy!</font>

111
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,120
<font size="48">I thought your punches were
as strong as pistols?</font>

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,920
<font size="48">S-shut up!</font>

113
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,060
<font size="48">I dunno why you're here, but you'd
best leave before you get hurt.</font>

114
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,590
<font size="48">Any closer and he'll shoot
your head off, wimp.</font>

115
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,530
<font size="48">He said no closer!</font>

116
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,520
<font size="48">Don't make me blow
your head off!</font>

117
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,340
<font size="48">Put your life on the line.</font>

118
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,620
<font size="48">Huh?!</font>

119
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,040
<font size="48">Huh?!</font>

120
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,890
<font size="48">Now that you've drawn your pistol,
put your life on the line.</font>

121
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,130
<font size="48">What the hell're
you talkin' about?</font>

122
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,290
<font size="48">I'm saying those aren't
for threatening people.</font>

123
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,760
<font size="48">--N-now you've done it!
--These bastards fight dirty!</font>

124
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,500
<font size="48">--Dirty?
--Cut the crap.</font>

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,400
<font size="48">What, do you think you're
dealing with saints or something?</font>

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,040
<font size="48">You're looking at pirates!</font>

127
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,340
<font size="48">Shut up! You got nothin' to do
with this in the first place!</font>

128
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,910
<font size="48">Listen, bandits.</font>

129
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,380
<font size="48">Whether I'm splattered with
alcohol or food or even spit on,</font>

130
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,020
<font size="48">most of the time I'd just
laugh and forget about it.</font>

131
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,290
<font size="48">But!</font>

132
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,020
<font size="48">No matter what the reason,</font>

133
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,460
<font size="48">anyone who hurts
my friends has to pay!</font>

134
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,950
<font size="48">Shanks...</font>

135
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,430
<font size="48">Has to pay, huh?!</font>

136
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,920
<font size="48">Lousy pirates!
Kill 'em, men!</font>

137
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,270
<font size="48">I'll handle this.
Should be easy enough.</font>

138
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,620
<font size="48">Don't get cocky, bandit.</font>

139
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,950
<font size="48">If you wanna fight us, then go
drag a warship here or somethin'.</font>

140
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,820
<font size="48">So strong!</font>

141
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,290
<font size="48"><i>H-hold on!
The kid attacked us!</i></font>

142
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,960
<font size="48"><i>You are a wanted man.</i></font>

143
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,200
<font size="48">Damn it!</font>

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,690
<font size="48">A smokescreen!</font>

145
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,640
<font size="48">Luffy!</font>

146
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,710
<font size="48">Crap! I let my guard down!
Luffy's gone!</font>

147
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,280
<font size="48">What do we do, guys?!</font>

148
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,710
<font size="48">Quit freakin'
the hell out, boss!</font>

149
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,550
<font size="48">It won't take us long
to find him!</font>

150
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,540
<font size="48">I can't believe this guy...</font>

151
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,460
<font size="48">I made a clean getaway!</font>

152
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,390
<font size="48">They'll never expect a mountain
bandit to escape onto the sea!</font>

153
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,890
<font size="48">Dammit! Let me go,
you stupid ape!</font>

154
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,460
<font size="48">I hope you die!</font>

155
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,470
<font size="48"><i>You wish! You're the one
who's gonna die!</i></font>

156
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,270
<font size="48">After all, you've made me mad!</font>

157
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,600
<font size="48">So long!</font>

158
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,670
<font size="48"><i>Dammit! Dammit!</i></font>

159
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,080
<font size="48"><i>Those guys are scum,</i></font>

160
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,070
<font size="48"><i>but I couldn't even
hit them once! Dammit!</i></font>

161
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,580
<font size="48">Sorry! I got no use
for you anymore!</font>

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,530
<font size="48">W-what the hell?!</font>

163
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,700
<font size="48">Help!</font>

164
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,020
<font size="48">Shanks!</font>

165
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,130
<font size="48">Get lost!</font>

166
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,370
<font size="48">I'm in your debt,
Luffy...</font>

167
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,770
<font size="48"><i>Makino-san told
me everything.</i></font>

168
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,260
<font size="48">You fought for us.</font>

169
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,080
<font size="48">Hey, don't cry!
You're a man!</font>

170
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,950
<font size="48">But... Shanks!</font>

171
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,350
<font size="48">Your arm!</font>

172
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,820
<font size="48">It's only an arm.
It's no big deal.</font>

173
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,480
<font size="48">I'm just glad
you're alright...</font>

174
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,980
<font size="48">You're leaving, then?</font>

175
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,120
<font size="48">Yeah. It was a long stay,
but now we part ways.</font>

176
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,650
<font size="48">Bet you'll miss me, huh?</font>

177
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,290
<font size="48">Well, yeah, but I won't
ask you to take me anymore.</font>

178
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,660
<font size="48">I've decided to become
a pirate on my own now!</font>

179
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,560
<font size="48">I wasn't gonna take you anyway!</font>

180
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,030
<font size="48">You'll never be a pirate!</font>

181
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,500
<font size="48">I will too!</font>

182
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,140
<font size="48">Someday, I'm gonna gather
a crew every good as yours,</font>

183
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,870
<font size="48">and I'm gonna find the greatest
treasure in the world,</font>

184
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,210
<font size="48">and I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates! I'll show you!</font>

185
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,770
<font size="48">You're gonna surpass us, huh?</font>

186
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,180
<font size="48">In that case...</font>

187
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,890
<font size="48">...I'll leave this hat with you.</font>

188
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,790
<font size="48">It's dear to me.</font>

189
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
<font size="48">Take good care of it!</font>

190
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,620
<font size="48"><i>Come bring it back
to me someday!</i></font>

191
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,960
<font size="48"><i>Once you've become
a great pirate!</i></font>

192
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,960
<font size="48"><i>That's our promise, Luffy!</i></font>
