<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Well, ya know, we did stay up that whole night fighting!</font>

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, why don't you take the cooking stuff over to the courtyard?</font>

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Victims' Association guys don't want to leave the place,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got back what was stolen from us...</font>

72
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's more, we even got a mountain of extra food, so we're fine.</font>

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But who brought that, I wonder... I guess there are some kind people here too.</font>

74
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They even brought all the treasure here...</font>

75

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if this was Christmas, this really is too much!</font>

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, this is cool! I'll take it!</font>

79
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, you can't just go around taking it like that, you know... R-Right, Nami-san...?</font>

80
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine. If it's just that one, it's not even all that valuable.</font>

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how it is...?</font>

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However! I'm not giving you a single bit of it!</font>

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not gonna steal anything from the ship of our saviors, you know, Namizou.</font>

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh! What a cool knife!</font>

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you just say?!</font>

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, but it's got jewels in it...</font>

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? I just spoke without thinking... Who's Namizou?</font>

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, isn't it odd?</font>

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It kinda feels like I've seen you before somewhere...</font>

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...</font>

91
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola?!</font>

92
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right... Did I even tell you my name?</font>

93
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it was you, Lola?!</font>

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad I got to see you again!</font>

95
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola, you mean...</font>

96
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, hey! Wait a second!</font>

97
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could she really be that boar-zombie?!</font>

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't remember, huh? I'll tell you all about it later!</font>

99
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway...</font>

100
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you this! As a sign of my gratitude!</font>

101
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Is that alright? To me?!</font>

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami is giving treasure away!</font>

103
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going on ahead, you think this will be enough?</font>

104
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A storm is coming!</font>

105
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, a storm? Seriously?</font>

106
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, this is bliss...</font>

107
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The light is... Hitting me, and...</font>

108
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're still alive...</font>

109
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are...</font>

110
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

111
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

112
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've brought food!</font>

113
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should have asked us, we would've carried it!</font>

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't have our saviours working like this!</font>

116
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Zoro awake yet?</font>

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still sleeping like a log... He's in the mansion.</font>

118
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wake up!</font>

119
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

120
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've brought the stuff you asked for!</font>

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, thanks!</font>

122
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is he?</font>

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time Zoro's been this badly injured...</font>

124
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was really close to dying...</font>

125
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just know it... Something must have happened to him...</font>

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While we were unconscious...</font>

127
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed. It's hard to believe that that man would just leave like that.</font>

128
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's also weird that Luffy is so energetic all of a sudden, isn't it?</font>

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea how that happened either!</font>

130
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened, huh?</font>

131
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, I saw it all!</font>

132
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw all of it, too!</font>

133
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll tell you!</font>

134
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's about what happened back then! {Halee: Added "It's" at the beginning of the sentence so that it doesn't sound too weird when connected to the previous one.}</font>

135
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come. {Sewil: changed from "Hey." as he says "koi" not "oi"}</font>

136
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?</font>

137
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, why? You were pretty cool too, you know!</font>

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Take my life instead of the swordsman's", you know?</font>

139
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Hurry up and tell me.</font>

140
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened afterwards?</font>

141
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After I fainted, I mean.</font>

142
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that Warlord had another crazy power, you see!</font>

143
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just put his paw on Straw Hat,</font>

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and repelled all of the damage that had been inflicted on him!</font>

145
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damage...?</font>

146
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like a huge ball of agony!</font>

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just touching a tiny bit of it, that swordsman screamed in pain!</font>

148
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, but I seriously thought that swordsman was gonna die.</font>

149
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, we actually cried!</font>

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We cried a lot!</font>

151
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... Then, that's why Luffy is in perfect shape, while Zoro ended up like that...</font>

152
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How reckless...</font>

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nothing... happened...</i></font>

154
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! We've gotta tell the rest of the crew this beautiful tale-</font>

155
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Don't you go running your mouths off with that stuff!</font>

156
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't risk his life so that we'd praise him about it.</font>

157
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And besides...</font>

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you think Luffy would feel if he knew all that pain he took on himself had gone and hurt his friend?!</font>

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just don't say anything!</font>

160
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as everyone is safe, that's all that matters.</font>

161
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'm gonna go eat.</font>

162
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-T-T-</font>

163
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're super cool!</font>

164
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a lucky captain!</font>

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

166
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you two.</font>

167
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said you knew something earlier, right?
What did you see?</font>

168
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go askin' us that stuff.</font>

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's safe... that's all that matters.</font>

170
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... I want to say it!</font>

171
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-The beautiful tale of what a man had to endure!</font>

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's eat!</font>

174
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So good!</font>

175
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never eaten anything so good!</font>

176
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We haven't eaten a proper meal in years! {Sewil: changed "for years" to "in years"}</font>

177
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so happy to be alive!</font>

178
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've made plenty!
Don't go leaving leftovers, you hear?!</font>

179
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am so glad I got to eat your food again, Cook-san!</font>

180
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is so good, I could continue until my stomach burst!</font>

181
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I do not have a stomach!</font>

182
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! Shut up and eat!</font>

183
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a funny skeleton!</font>

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, ah, excuse me.</font>

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being able to eat to my heart's content yesterday, and again today... I think...</font>

186
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I might be getting fat!</font>

187
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Even if I'm just bones!", right?! Shut up, you!</font>

188
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skeleton, you're the best!</font>

189
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, how can you move, anyway?</font>

190
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, who cares?</font>

191
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We didn't even toast, but it turned into a party anyway, huh?</font>

192
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not waking up even with this much noise... {Halee: Was "Even if it's this noisy, he's still not waking up..."}</font>

193
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he's usually the toughest one here...</font>

194
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chopper! This...</font>

195
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

196
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...is Zoro's share!</font>

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, drink up!</font>

198
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make him drink that!</font>

199
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with you?! Zoro likes this stuff, so it should make him better, right?!</font>

200
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of medicine is that?!</font>

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't?</font>

202
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, how about meat?</font>

203
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, okay! Thanks for the sentiment, that's enough!</font>

204
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just the sentiment, okay?</font>

205
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was a piano in this room?</font>

206
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, weren't you a violinist?</font>

207
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can play any instrument you like!</font>

208
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... You're pretty good.</font>

209
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, about that conversation earlier...</font>

210
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is, I saw it all, too.</font>

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was deeply touched by what the two of you did.</font>

212
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sure is nice to have friends, isn't it?</font>

213
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't bother saying "the two of you"... I just ended up looking like an idiot.</font>

214
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you were just as prepared as he was.</font>

215
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there any song you'd like to hear?</font>

216
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have a request...</font>

217
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Anything goes?</font>

218
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, how about...?</font>

219
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">{\an8}Yo-hohoho, Yohohohoo,</font>

220
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to asking for requests?</font>

221
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">{\an8}Yo-hohoho, Yohohohoo,</font>

222
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">{\an8}Going to deliver Binks' Sake!</font>

223
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Binks' Sake"... I think I know this song from somewhere... It's very nostalgic...</font>

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">{\an8}Following the sea breeze! Riding on the waves!</font>

225
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook! I know this song!
Shanks and his crew used to sing it.</font>

226
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back in the old days, every pirate would sing this song.</font>

227
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Through hard times, and fun times...</font>

228
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say, you're gonna come with us... right?</font>

229
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got your shadow back, right?</font>

230
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So even though the sun rises, you can still travel, can't you?</font>

231
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speaking of that... there is one thing I did not tell you...</font>

232
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

233
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have... a promise I made with a friend.</font>

234
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, I have to fulfill that promise.</font>

235
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otherwise... I could not call myself a man.</font>

236
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... Laboon, right? I know. Franky told me.</font>

237
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so? Laboon...</font>

238
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is indeed the name of that whale...</font>

239
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is waiting for me at that cape...</font>

240
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I was trying to say, Brook...</font>

241
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We met Laboon at the twin capes! It's true!</font>

242
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already know that Laboon has been waiting for his friends to return there for fifty years now.</font>

243
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton! What's wrong?</font>

244
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not playing the piano as quickly anymore!</font>

245
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a real surprise...</font>

246
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We never thought that the last surviving one of the pirates he was waiting for...</font>

247
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would actually turn out to be you!</font>

248
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And... You still remember the promise, too!</font>

249
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once he finds out, I'm sure Laboon will be really happy!</font>

250
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait... Wait a minute, please.</font>

251
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a surprise!</font>

252
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out of the blue... are you telling me you really... met Laboon?!</font>

253
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

254
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after fifty years has passed?!</font>

255
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon is still waiting at that cape, even now?!</font>

256
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that true?!</font>

257
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

258
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can vouch for it too! We really met him.</font>

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

260
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How was he doing?</font>

261
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was doing great!</font>

262
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was big as a mountain.</font>

263
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That I must see... back when we left him behind, you know...</font>

264
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was still only the size of a small boat... He was rather cute...</font>

265
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could be a little difficult sometimes,</font>

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he loved music... he was a good kid...</font>

267
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even now... If I close my eyes, I can see his face...</font>

268
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is still there...</font>

269
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, that's how it is...?</font>

270
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, he is still fine?</font>

271
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have never been so happy before...</font>

272
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's with this whale? He's following the ship...</i></font>

273
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Must've got separated from his herd, huh...? Poor little thing... The ocean's a big place...</i></font>

274
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He looks so sad... And he's still just a kid, isn't he?</i></font>

275
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, Captain Yorki... Shall we sing a song?</font>

276
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook! Great idea!</font>

277
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, everyone, get your instruments!</font>

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can bring a smile to even a crying child's face!</font>

279
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's show him what the Rumbar Pirates can do!</font>

280
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

281
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One, two, three, four!</font>

282
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,630
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Rumbar Pirates
Musician, swordsman</font>

283
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Hi, good day, everyone! It's morning!</font>

284
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,850
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Brook
(50 years ago, 38 years old)</font>

285
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us start singing our morning song!</font>

286
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the power-tune we will be bringing you this week is...</font>

287
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That famous song,
"Black Handkerchief of Happiness"!</font>

288
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, feel free to join in!</font>

289
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Oh, white handkerchief</font>

290
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Don't let him find you!</font>

291
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Run away</font>

292
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Oh, white handkerchief</font>

293
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Don't let the octopus get you!</font>

294
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Watch out for the ink! Look, there's a squid as well! That's the ink again!</font>

295
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}P-Please stop making that noise so early in the morning!</font>

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}We're getting up! We're getting up, Brook!</font>

297
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Oh, white handkerchief</font>

298
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Ugh, we're awake! We're awake!</font>

299
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">It's the all inked Black Handkerchief of Happiness</font>

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook! Try playing that song as a ballad!</font>

301
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood! The captain's favorite song!</font>

302
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the whale!</font>

303
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... you're that little guy from yesterday...</font>

304
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still hanging around? Go look for your pod!</font>

305
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So cute!</font>

306
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, how long is he going to keep following us?</font>

307
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure his mom is worried!</font>

308
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, have some food, Laboon!</font>

309
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, whoa, since when does the thing have a name?</font>

310
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're under attack!</font>

311
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?!</font>

312
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help us! This guy has got a damaged leg!</font>

313
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain! An injured man fell into the sea!</font>

314
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just throw out the life buoy!
We'll have to help him afterwards!</font>

315
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose that is all I can do, seeing how I can not swim...</font>

316
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saved us, Laboon!</font>

317
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! We're fine!</font>

318
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Laboon!</font>

319
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, everyone sing! We're singing "that song"!</font>

320
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be freezing, right?</font>

321
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Treasure! We found it, Laboon!</font>

322
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna have a real feast today!</font>

323
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it!</font>

324
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sea monster appeared!</font>

325
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protect Laboon!</font>

326
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

327
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He likes you most, doesn't he, Brook?</font>

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, Laboon loves music.</font>

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah, it's probably because your heads have the same shape!</font>

330
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ah, I see.</i></font>

331
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You... can't you do anything about it?</i></font>

332
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've all tried telling him, but...</font>

333
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won't listen to us, it seems.</font>

334
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You understand, right?</font>

335
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think we're strong enough to protect him if we take him any further...</font>

336
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just a kid.</font>

337
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't take him with us to the Grand Line.</font>

338
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please listen to what I have to...</font>

339
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, the song will have to wait.</font>

340
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We certainly are comrades, but you are just a whale...</font>

341
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Grand Line is a dangerous sea! Really!</font>

342
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, you're a big kid now...</font>

343
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there are beasts out there like nothing we've ever seen here in West Blue...</font>

344
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon, listen to...</font>

345
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use. He refuses to listen.</font>

346
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't work, huh?</font>

347
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then how about a song first?
Let's sing that song.</font>

348
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That would only make it worse, I think...</i></font>

349
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no good... I know it's hard,
but we've gotta turn our backs on him, okay?</font>

350
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until Laboon leaves the ship, we're not gonna sing or play any music.</font>

351
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be thrown overboard at this rate, captain!</font>

352
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that! That's our guidelight, pointing to the entrance of the Grand Line!</font>

353
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can anyone see Laboon?!</font>

354
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, we haven't seen him for a week!</font>

355
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel sorry for him, but this was for the best.</font>

356
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he's lucky, he might be able to return to his family.</font>

357
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men, are you prepared?!</font>

358
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! We're ready!</font>

359
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then let's go! To the world's largest ocean!</font>

360
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

361
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the lighthouse-keeper, Crocus. Good job making it over Reverse Mountain.</font>

362
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Welcome to the Pirate Graveyard.</font>

363
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,290
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grand Line Entrance
Twin Capes</font>

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Hey, hey, this isn't some kind of show, you know!</font>

365
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back in West Blue, I'm known as "Calico Yorki".</font>

366
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to bother you, Crocus-san, but...
Well, our ship got pretty damn beat up back there...</font>

367
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may stay as long as you wish, but I'll ask you
to help with the food and drinks while you're here.</font>

368
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, you're something! Sponging off pirates, huh?</font>

369
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, sounds fair. Why don't you join us in our celebrations?</font>

370
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today, we're all gonna throw a huge party!</font>

371
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, that whale that came with you, is that your pet?</font>

372
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon!</font>

373
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

374
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook! Let's sing that song!</font>

375
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, you really love that song, don't you?</font>

376
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! It's the song of pirates!
Laboon! You love that song too, right?</font>

377
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yohohoho, yohohoho</font>

378
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yohohoho, yohohoho</font>

379
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Going to deliver Binks' sake</font>

380
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Following the sea breeze, riding on the waves</font>

381
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crocus-san. Do you have a request?</font>

382
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Far across the salty deeps, the merry evening sun</font>

383
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything goes, huh, Brook?</font>

384
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates love singing!</font>

385
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Painting circles in the sky, birds singing along</font>

386
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Farewell to the harbour, to my old hometown</font>

387
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Let's all sing out with a DON, as the ship sets sail</font>

388
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,090
<font face="impress bt" size="45">3 months later</font>

389
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please understand.</font>

390
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon! Wait for us! Our ship is gonna sail straight ahead, and cross this sea.</font>

391
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might sound strange, but we'll end up on the other side of the Red Line again...</font>

392
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then we'll climb this wall once again, and return to this cape!</font>

393
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just wait for that!
It should take about two or three years,</font>

394
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and after that, you'll see us all again!</font>

395
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that time comes, you should have grown big and strong!</font>

396
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See you later, Laboon! Stay well!</font>

397
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon! When that time comes, no matter where we go, you can come with us on our adventures again!</font>

398
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're comrades, after all!</font>

399
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon! We'll definitely travel around the world, and come back here!</font>

400
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for us!</font>

401
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,240
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Three years later</font>

402
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,860
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Florian Triangle</font>

403
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, Brook! Your techniques are incredible!
Can you also teach me how to use a sword?</i></font>

404
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A tornado?! But it was clear and sunny just a minute ago!</font>

405
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's run! Common sense won't work on this sea!</font>

406
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man... now that we're actually here, this place really is unpredictable... Can we really hold up?</font>

407
00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, but hey, a rough day just makes the sake at the end taste all the sweeter! Ain't that right, Brook?</font>

408
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Play a tune for us again, today! Play that song!</font>

409
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew you would say that! Well then, here I go!</font>

410
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Do it, do it!</font>

411
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mirror...</font>

412
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... So, I have become a skeleton...</font>

413
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow, ow...</font>

414
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Owowowowowow! That hurts, Captain!</i></font>

415
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why am I getting punished too?!</font>

416
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Stop fighting about such stupid things!</font>

417
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Captain, this guy nearly killed me with a stray bullet in that battle back there!</font>

418
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're still alive, right? He's already apologized as well!</font>

419
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop fighting about stuff that's already in the past! It's pathetic!</font>

420
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurts!</font>

421
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pain proves that you're alive!</font>

422
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

423
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stars... This vast, starry sky... I wonder if Laboon is looking at it as well...</font>

424
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think, Captain?</font>

425
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, everyone, come and see this! Brook's being sentimental!</font>

426
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please stop! That is embarrassing!</font>

427
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're from the Navy Headquarters! What should we do?!</font>

428
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be scared! Get them!</font>

429
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, look! The captain's bounty just went up again!</font>

430
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's that?!</font>

431
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us sing a song!</font>

432
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:39,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yorki~! Yorki~! May his name echo all the way back to Twin Capes!</font>

433
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Terrible news! Hey, it's the captain! There's something wrong with Captain Yorki!</font>

434
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An infectious disease?!</font>

435
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

436
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody go into the room... There are ten others infected besides the Captain...</font>

437
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He may have got it in that jungle we passed through...</font>

438
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an undiscovered virus... I'm afraid there's nothing I can do!</font>

439
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a terrible situation...</font>

440
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If things go badly, it could kill this entire crew!</font>

441
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain... Captain Yorki...</font>

442
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't sound so damn depressed...</font>

443
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll ruin the good name of the Rumbar Pirates, who can make a crying child laugh.</font>

444
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll just be... leaving the Grand Line a little ahead of you guys...</font>

445
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys just leave this old ship with us and the virus...</font>

446
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should... find yourselves a new ship, and keep on going!</font>

447
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain...</font>

448
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll do what we can... and see if we can somehow make it out of the Grand Line through the Calm Belt...</font>

449
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it'll work out somehow. Sorry, you guys...</font>

450
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give Laboon my best regards!</font>

451
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wipe those looks off your faces, guys, and stand up straight!</font>

452
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

453
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook...</font>

454
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't take it...!</font>

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Yorki... I will never forget those words!!</font>

457
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right, Captain?! I have engraved them into my heart! Please... take good care of yourself... Captain!!</font>

458
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shall be leaving this ship... But please... Live, and let us all meet again!</font>

459
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just take off this mask!</font>

460
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us all sing together again...!</font>

461
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook...</font>

462
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send me off with... My favorite song...</font>

463
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Going to deliver Binks' Sake...</font>
