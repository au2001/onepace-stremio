93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kick my ass?</font>

111
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,250

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, no, it's Nami-san...</font>

113
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely Nami-san.</font>

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without a doubt.</font>

115
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that surprised me...</font>

116
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such beauty can be tricky.</font>

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a second I thought I rescued a fairy by accident.</font>

118
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Geez...</font>

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">What're you blabbering on about?</font>

120
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're one of the crew members who was on the ship, aren't you?</font>

121
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-An angel?!</font>

122
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, no, no, it's a human.</font>

123
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt about it.</font>

124
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That got me.</font>

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't blame you.</font>

126
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not in the least.</font>

127
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing Nami-san dressed in this snow white color is confusing.</font>

128
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absolutely right!</font>

129
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with those two?</font>

130
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">We're thinking alike.</font>

131
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse you, pirate!</font>

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've no reason to get along with you!</font>

133
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That could've hit Nami-san.</font>

135
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should avoid attacking recklessly in a lady's presence.</font>

136
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job avoiding that.</font>

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems you no longer have your shadow.</font>

138
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, there was this newbie zombie who had a strange attachment to that woman.</font>

139
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rebel zombie with some ego still left in him.</font>

140
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was probably your zombie.</font>

141
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that he wasn't included among the General Zombies must mean that his real body is weak.</font>

142
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That overconfident penguin was actually pretty weak.</font>

143
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so absurd...</font>

144
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for a pathetic underling to pick a fight with me, a monster and commander of the General Zombies!</font>

145
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A nymph?!</font>

146
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That surprised me...</font>

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was a nymph for a second.</font>

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, I don't wanna get rough...</font>

149
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave that woman with me and go back to your life in the shadows.</font>

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm busy right now...</font>

151
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My strongest underlings were annihilated by your stupid captain's zombie.</font>

152
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And before that, I couldn't even give my bride the vow kiss...</font>

153
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you get it?</font>

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm terribly irritated right now.</font>

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no time to deal with amateurs like y-</font>

156
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you Carnival-beast-face man!</font>

157
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama!</font>

158
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

159
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He sent that 300 kilogram body flying in an instant!</font>

160
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be the invisible man Usopp spoke of.</font>

161
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that kick?!</font>

162
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hogback improved my body with the power of the wild, and yet he blew me away...</font>

163
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hands of the Dead!</font>

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the meaning of this?!</font>

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he know what I was about to do?!</font>

166
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Basse Côte!</font>

171
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Something grabbed me...!</i></font>

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who saw Nami-san completely naked in the bathroom, aren't you?</font>

173
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You'll be my bride.</i></font>

181
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he really just an underling?!</font>

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better not have gotten violent with her!</font>

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What marriage?!</font>

191
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at my eyes! I'll kick the hell out of you and make a croquette with your remains!</font>

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's one more unfortunate thing...</font>

206
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You and I have...</font>

207
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A connection!</font>

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, you're the man who stole my dream.</font>

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't remember you.</font>

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be some kind of misunderstanding.</font>

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today is the first time...</font>

214
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've ever met with you.</font>

215
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll blow you away!</font>

216
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With these Hands of the Dead!</font>

217
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take them off.</font>

218
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to take off those bazookas attached to your arms.</font>

219
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you get it?</font>

220
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Nami-san gets hurt because of your mindless attack, you won't appear very alive when I finish with you.</font>

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He knows nothing...</font>

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to...</font>

223
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take them off!</font>

224
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! A bazooka suddenly appeared!</font>

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how it is, right?</font>

226
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a very clever attack.</font>

227
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You make your body invisible, and anything that comes in contact with your body invisible.</font>

228
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's your ability...</font>

229
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Transparent Fruit's invisible man.</font>

230
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know everything you're capable of!</font>

231
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that possible...?!</font>

232
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you...?!</font>

233
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has that man met Absalom-sama before?</font>

234
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does he know everything about his abilities?</font>

235
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I was a kid, I saw a large picture book about the devil fruit.</font>

236
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At first, I wasn't interested in all those rumors about sea curses, but...</font>

237
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">while flipping through it, I came across a single item that caught my eye.</font>

238
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I happened to find that ability...</font>

239
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">even if I was to become cursed, I'd gladly eat it!</font>

240
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But two of the same fruit don't exist in this world.</font>

241
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If by any chance, I ran into the user of that fruit, my dream would collapse!</font>

242
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get it now?!</font>

243
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wished to become the invisible man!</font>

244
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why, the moment you ate the
Transparent Fruit, you crushed my dream!</font>

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right!</font>

246
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted my dream to come true!</font>

254
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,300

257
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if we add that you put Nami-san in danger, that means I'll definitely never forgive you!</font>

260
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you thinking?!</font>

261
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a ridiculous connection!</font>

262
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard!</font>

263
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a...!</font>

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to...!</font>

266
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hear that from you!</font>

267
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right!</font>

268
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're the same!</font>

269
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well!</font>

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll return your connection, your rage, everything back to you!</font>

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only do I have a lion's jaw...!</font>

272
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Elephant skin...!</font>

273
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three hundred kilograms of condensed bear and gorilla muscle!</font>

274
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:50,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Implant after implant, Dr. Hogback kept working on me until I obtained the ultimate masterpiece body!</font>

275
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Transparent Fruit is nothing but an bonus.</font>

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't even compare to the terrible strength I have!</font>

277
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand now?</font>

278
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

279
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still peeked on her!</font>

280
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is true!</font>

281
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it had been an ordinary kick, his leg would've been destroyed...</font>

282
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just as if my body was a regular human body to him.</font>

283
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'll have the last laugh!</font>

284
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lost the ability you wished for and now even the woman you intend to protect will be my bride!</font>

285
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've no chance to beat me in this state!</font>

286
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Back then, Nami disappeared along with him and we couldn't follow him!</i></font>

287
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to hide Nami-san, don't you?!</font>

288
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over my dead body!</font>

289
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's useless!</font>

290
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll show you the power of the beast man!</font>

291
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you intend to sacrifice yourself for that woman?</font>

292
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protect her then!</font>

293
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can!</font>

294
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beast Man's Hands!</font>

295
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beast Man's Legs!</font>

296
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let go of her!</font>

297
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry... Nami-san...</font>

298
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You let her go?</font>

299
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you value your life over hers after all!</font>

300
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry...</font>

301
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna stain that snow white dress...</font>

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn... you just hide and sneak, you invisible man...</font>

303
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't give a damn about that dream anymore...</font>

304
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I no longer... care about being an invisible man!</font>

305
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll peek on my own!</font>

306
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still wanna peek?!</font>

307
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me, bastard!</font>

308
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go!</font>

309
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I would, you filthy bastard!</font>

310
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're made of many beasts...</font>

311
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll make a fine minced meat!</font>

312
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Let go of me!</font>

313
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Extra Haché!</font>

314
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Haché: Mincemeat</i></font>

315
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama!</font>

316
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Women's bath...</font>

317
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

318
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A beast's bride...</font>

319
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ought to be another beast.</font>

320
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still following me!</font>

321
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it wasn't for him, I'd have already beaten the other pirates!</font>

322
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Nega-nose!</font>

323
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still following me!</font>

324
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it wasn't for him, I'd have already beaten that hollow-hollow woman!</font>

325
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn bear zombie!</font>

326
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait...!</font>

327
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

328
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, hollow-hollow woman!</font>

329
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

330
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kumashi, hurry up and stop him!</font>

331
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait...!</font>

332
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lay a hand on Perona-sama...!</font>

333
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too close! Too close!</font>

334
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona-sama...!</font>

335
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a terrifying power for a stuffed doll!</font>

336
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

337
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure-Kill...</font>

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blazing Ball!</font>

339
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked!</font>

340
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A zombie is a zombie after all!</font>

341
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, with this oil, I'll perform my
"You Won't Come Here Technique"!</font>

342
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What...?</font>

343
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid bear!</font>

344
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't catch me now!</font>

345
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now nothing is in my way.</font>

346
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand my power now?</font>

347
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see now, I've got a hollow-hollow woman weaker than me that I must punish.</font>

348
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd she go?</font>

349
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over here, Nega-nose.</font>

350
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe outside the window...?</font>

351
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, that's not possible...</font>

352
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in a pretty high pla-</font>

353
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You...!</font>

354
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come you can fly?!</font>

355
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're supposed to manipulate ghosts only!</font>

356
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's your real ability?!</font>

357
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better not underestimate the Ghost Princess, fool.</font>

358
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just thought of a way to get rid of you.</font>

359
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I'm done with you, taking care of the remaining pirates won't be a problem.</font>

360
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

361
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a... bad feeling about that statement!</font>
