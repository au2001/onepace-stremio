132
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For free?  Really?!</font>

133
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monsieur!  They emptied the whole store!</font>

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You really did go all out!</i></font>

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How nice for you.</font>

136
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?  What could that be?</font>

137
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a lot of noise coming from outside.</font>

138
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monsieur!  Big news!</font>

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He is here!</font>

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he here?</font>

142
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

143
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look up at the sky!</font>

144
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's come down from the royal palace!</font>

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jamon!  Jamon!</font>

146
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  A whale?</font>

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would he come to these lowly waters?</font>

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've seen him in person!</font>

149
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?  He doesn't even have an escort!</font>

150
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!  He decided to just suddenly come down here on his own?!</font>

151
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe there's some kind of national crisis?!</font>

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,170
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ruler of the Ryuuguu Kingdom

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one huge merman!</font>

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I much prefer the mermaids.</font>

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, you guys!</i></font>

159
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a shaggy old guy!</font>

160
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm telling you, you're being rude!</i></font>

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Kneel before him already!</i></font>

162
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That whale is so cute!</font>

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he have business with those humans? </font>

164
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Megalo.  You're sure it's these people -jamon?</font>

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Didn't we meet that shark on the way here?</font>

166
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, human with the straw hat, and his friends.</font>

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have come...</font>

168
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to take you...</font>

169

171
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>R-R-R-R-R-Ryuuguu Palace?!</i></font>

173
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,720
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Near the Fishman District "Noah"
The depths</font>

174
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! Row Faster!</font>

175
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or else they'll spot us!</font>

176
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're caught in a deep sea current!  This is tough!</font>

177
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is why we should've
had a paddle installed on the ship!</font>

178
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you realize how brutal the New World is?!</font>

179
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, look!</font>

180
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something ahead of us!</font>

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody Jones!</font>

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way!  He found us!</font>

183
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  He's...</font>

184
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  He's wearing handcuffs! </font>

185
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He disappeared!</font>

186
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did that damn bastard go?!</font>

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He pierced through the hull!</font>

188
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take him down!  There's only one enemy!</font>

189
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've fought against fishmen before.</font>

190
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many trials do you think I've overcome to get this far?!</font>

191
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just a fish!
Don't underestimate humans, you fool!</font>

192
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

193
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Damn it!</i></font>

194
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, this is a nasty thing we've gotten hold of -hi.</font>

195
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power drugs... Energy Steroids.</font>

196
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fishman's inherent physical strength is ten times that of a regular human.</font>

197
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, your power is doubled again if you take a single Energy Steroid pill.</font>

198
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Twenty times the strength of a human.</font>

199
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Taking two of them multiplies it again!</font>

200
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The price for this dreamlike power is that it shortens your lifespan.</font>

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, we will accept an early death in exchange for furthering our cause!</font>

202
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is that bastard doing?!</font>

203
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he planning to do with the mast?!</font>

204
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I understand why he's wearing handcuffs!</font>

205
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's showing us that he
doesn't even need his hands to sink us!</font>

206
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The life of Fisher Tiger was taken by humans!
The will of Arlong, too!</font>

207
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our generation will end
Fishman Island's dark history of oppression!</font>

208
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We, the New Fishman Pirates, will end it!</font>

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Float into the New World.</font>

210
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, goodness... You didn't kill them all, did you?</font>

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I need them alive.</font>

212
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Live with those wounds and show the world above...</font>

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what happened to you here beneath the sea!</font>

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell them who you met!</font>

215
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell the humans on dry land about our terror!</font>

216
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will take the center of the world, Fishman Island,</font>

217
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">from that pathetic Sea God, Neptune,</font>

218
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and drag you humans into the dark depths of the sea!</font>

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll teach you all that fishmen are the superior species!</font>

220
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A few hours ago...</i></font>

221
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ryuuguu Kingdom, the Mermaids' Cove. </i></font>

222
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This thing is so tightly sealed.</font>

223
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what's inside it?</font>

224
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This would be some sort of chest if it was treasure.</font>

225
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since it's just a barrel,
maybe it's filled with some high-class liquor? </font>

226
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's... so hard... to open!</font>

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's quite enough.</font>

228
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Opening it up this much is more than sufficient!</font>

229
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  There was someone inside of it?!</font>

230
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

231
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a ton!</font>

232
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really grateful, my dear mermaids!</font>

233
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try to run away, now!</font>

234
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quick!  Into the water!</font>

235
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too late for that!</font>

236
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... sinking...</font>

237
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a swamp!
How'd it get in this rocky area?! </font>

238
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't break free from this bog!</font>

239
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's bottomless!</font>

240
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a Devil Fruit User.
A swamp-man, who ate the Swamp Fruit!</font>

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The more you struggle...</font>

242
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

243
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...the faster you sink!</font>

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help!</font>

245
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, don't scream.  I'm not gonna kill you.</font>

246
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody-</font>

247
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Didn't I just tell you not to do that, you idiot?!</i></font>

248
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ishilly!</font>

249
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just need you to go to sleep for a little while!</font>

250
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body is bottomless...</font>

251
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much do they pay for mermaids again?</font>

252
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I seem to recall the starting price at auction being 70,000,000 for one of them.</font>

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So with three, that's...</font>

254
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I owe the Straw Hats one for this!</font>

255
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to them, I was able to enter Fishman Island without registering...</font>

256
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I can hunt high-class mermaids freely!</font>

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is a treasure island!</font>

260
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were they the ones who kidnapped the girls from the Mermaids' Cove?</font>

261
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I didn't say that.</font>

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They seemed like nice people...</font>

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And besides, they're Caimie's friends.</font>

264
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They may have threatened her.</font>

265
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

266
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we look at the facts,
the only ones who were there at the time...</font>

267
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were us guards, the girls,</font>

268
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the gang from the Fishman District who were beaten...</font>

269
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the Straw Hats.</font>

270
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we have nobody who can attest to what they were up to after they disappeared.</font>

271
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans always have a reason to kidnap mermaids.</font>

272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In human society, young mermaids are sold at high prices.</font>

273
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even so, you can't just accuse them based on guesswork.</font>

274
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea how many humans have put up a nice front, then kidnapped mermaids in the past?!</font>

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi. </font>

276
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Madame Shyarly,
about what you were saying earlier...</font>

277
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you really see a future like that?</font>

278
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That the pirate Straw Hat Luffy
is going to destroy Fishman Island?</font>

279
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly, have some water.</font>

280
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I saw it.</font>

281
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is what I saw, no doubt about it.</font>

282
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even we at Ryuuguu Palace have heard how accurate your predictions are.</font>

283
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is quite a dilemma.</font>

284
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were going to thank them for saving our sister's pet.</font>

285
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now, even if this prediction is unconfirmed, we can't just let them roam free.</font>

286
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to capture them.</font>

287
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,570
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ryuuguu Kingdom
 Elite District: "Gyoverly Hills"</font>

288
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gone...</font>

289
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who were they, anyway?</font>

290
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think that King Neptune would personally invite them to the Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

291
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't fall off!</font>

292
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune!</font>

293
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you, old geezer?</font>

294
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those yells are ridiculous.</font>

295
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Quit being so rude!</i></font>

296
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw, you're scary!  You're honestly scaring me!</i></font>

297
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That shark there, Megalo...</font>

298
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's my daughter's pet,
and she cares a lot about him -jamon.</font>

299
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Megalo didn't come back, she wouldn't stop crying.</font>

300
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he'd been attacked by the Kraken...</font>

301
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,660
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Megalo <font size="28">(The Mermaid Princess' Beloved Shark)</font></font>

302
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was really dangerous,
and I'm thankful that you saved him -jamon.</font>

303
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it was just a coincidence,
but yeah, good thing we managed to save him.</font>

304
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he's the Mermaid Princess' pet?</font>

305
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?  Pappagg-san, did you not once say that
you and the Mermaid Princess were best friends?</font>

306
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so that was a lie?</font>

307
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is it really alright?</font>

308
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For us to come along to the Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

309
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did say "Your friends are quite welcome too -jamon", so what's the problem?</font>

310
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To tell you the truth, I sent my sons out to fetch you,
but they still haven't returned -jamon.</font>

311
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I decided to go myself.</font>

312
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, I too am looking forward to the feast, and wish to start eating soon -jamon!</font>

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I forgot to mention, but one of your friends
has already been taken there.</font>

314
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

315
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a swordsman.  He began drinking already.</font>

316
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These feasts are more fun if everyone's there.
What a selfish man.</font>

317
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe his name was...</font>

318
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, huh?</font>

319
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Zoro, alright.</font>

320
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zori!  </font>

321
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's Zoro!</i></font>

322
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards are looking for your companions and will invite them all to the castle, so don't worry -jamon.</font>

323
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, do you know where they went?</font>

324
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>With this many people around, I might be able to find information sooner than I'd thought.</i></font>

325
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh?</i></font>

326
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm most curious about where I can find the relatives
of my shipwright master.</i></font>

327
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is Tom-san's homeland.</i></font>

328
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I have some things I want to investigate as well.</i></font>

329
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You too?</i></font>

330
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Since ancient times, Fishman Island has been an island rich with folklore.</i></font>

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm sure another one lies here...</i></font>

332
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A valuable fragment of history.</i></font>

333
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we split up again.</font>

334
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You haven't had any trouble, right?</font>

335
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you could say we have,
and you could say we haven't...</font>

336
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, old man.  </font>

337
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Sea God, Neptune-sama you're talking to!</font>

338
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:24,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're ten thousand meters under the sea, so
why is it so bright in the area around Fishman Island?</font>

339
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not that the area surrounding Fishman Island is bright.</font>

340
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the only place on the ocean floor where the sun shines, so fishmen started living here long ago.</font>

341
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how Fishman Island was founded.</font>

342
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The roots of the Treasure Tree, Eve,
reach down to these depths.</font>

343
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They transfer sunlight directly from the surface
to the bottom of the sea.</font>

344
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Transfer sunlight?</font>

345
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you are saying this tree has glowing roots
that reach ten thousand meters below the sea?</font>

346
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  The scientists keep making new theories for how this can be,</font>

347
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it is a mysterious tree that receives light at the surface and emits it from its roots -jamon. </font>

348
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And its respiration supplies air to the sea floor as well.</font>

349
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's like the big boss of the
Yarukiman Mangroves on Sabaody?</font>

350
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, shaggy old guy, I'm hungry!</font>

351
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey you!</i></font>

352
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are almost there.</font>

353
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the entrance -jamon.</font>

354
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ding-dong.</i></font>

355
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes?</font>

356
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me -jamon.</font>

357
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That phrase... Y-Your Majesty!</font>

358
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will lower the path for you immediately!</font>

359
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep your bubbles on tight -jamon.</font>

360
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let us go.</font>

361
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune! </font>

362
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really looking forward to getting to the Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

363
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here we are -jamon.</font>

364
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,370
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Royal Palace of the Ryuuguu Kingdom 
 Ryuuguu Palace</font>

365
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!  This is so cool!</font>

366
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes Pappagg-san's mansion look as small as a flea.</font>

367
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't compare them!</i></font>

368
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a beautiful castle!</font>

369
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Neptune has returned!</font>

370
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was wondering where he'd gone.</font>

371
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the gate!</font>

372
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Opening the gate!</font>

373
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Welcome back, Your Majesty!</i></font>

374
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This castle looks like a lot of fun!</font>

375
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is my palace -jamon!  Make yourselves at home!</font>

376
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>For crying out loud!  You did it again!</i></font>

377
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You just went into the kingdom on your own without considering your position again!</i></font>

378
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You can't just go down to the surface without even bringing an escort!</i></font>

379
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we to do?</font>

380
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be more careful in the future -jamon.</font>

381
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He got scolded.</i></font>

382
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If something happened to you, it'd be too late for apologies!</font>

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you even realize the situation our country is in?!</font>

384
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind all that, look!</font>

385
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have brought the people who saved Megalo
when he was being bullied by the Kraken -jamon!</font>

386
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, welcome our guests!</font>

387
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, what is Princess Shirahoshi doing?</font>

388
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Your Majesty, it seems to have happened again...</font>

389
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  This is all because you didn't
watch over the princess to keep her calm!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And while that was going on...</i></font>

392
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>you just disappeared without a trace!  Can't you see that you made everyone worry, Your Majesty?!  </i></font>

393
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>In the first place...</i></font>

394
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promise I will be more careful in the future -jamon.</font>

395
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He got scolded again.</i></font>

396
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sincerely apologize for bringing this up when you've just brought guests here...</font>

<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ryuuguu Kingdom  Minister of the Right
 (Seahorse Merman)</font>

398
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we have important business to discuss.</font>

399
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Prince Fukaboshi...</font>

400
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,020

401
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">contacted us just a moment ago.</font>

402
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we to do?</font>

403
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi, you say?  What happened?!</font>

404
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see...</font>

405
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder how long they intend to ignore us?</font>

406
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Where'd Luffy go?</font>

407
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just here!</font>

408
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't stay still even for a minute, can he?</font>

409
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he thinking, wandering around on God's land?!</font>

410
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep, it's this way...</font>

411
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The smell of tasty food!</font>

412
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe this is where they're holding the feast?</font>

413
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They said Zoro was already here, didn't they?</font>

414
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, that is one huge, thick and solid-looking door!</font>

415
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wall looks really sturdy too.
They're like the walls in Impel Down!</font>

416
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of delicious food do they have inside?!</font>

417
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pitch black in here...
So this isn't where the feast is being held?</font>

418
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they do have some food that smells really nice here!</font>

419
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So is this the food storage room, then?</font>

420
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever!  I'll have some!</font>

421
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My hunger is at its limit!</font>

422
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

423
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are corals wherever I go on this island, huh?</font>

424
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?  It's so soft...</font>

425
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Was that someone's voice?</font>

426
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This coral feels like pudding!</font>

427
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is somebody there?!</font>

428
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?!</font>

429
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing on someone else's body?!</font>

430
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who might you be?!</font>

431
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,750
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Princess of the Ryuuguu Kingdom

432
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  It was a huge person... No, a mermaid?!</font>

433
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You've come to take my life too, haven't you?</font>

434
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But I'm not afraid of you!</font>

435
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, I'm the daughter of Neptune...</font>

436
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm not...</font>

437
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not...</font>

438
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody!</font>

439
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!  Big brother!</font>

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, hey... I didn't do anything!</font>

441
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, what is wrong with you?!</font>
