64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right?</font>

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a lab!</font>

76
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost complete!</font>

87
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish that plates were extinct.</font>

88
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that!</font>

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why do you pick foods that need them?!</font>

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's lots of other things you can make!</font>

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Cindry-chan's there too...</font>

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yakisoba for example, or... yakiudon or...</font>

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Fried noodles</i></font>

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay?</font>

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe katsudon or...</font>

96
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Breaded pork on rice</i></font>

97
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is she really the same girl who died in that accident?</font>

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it...</font>

99
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No more soups or anything!</font>

100
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And this soup spaghetti?</font>

101
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that on the table?</font>

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like it's a corpse...</font>

103
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being in that colour, there's no way it's alive.</font>

104
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's got a number on it just like the zombies in the graveyard!</font>

105
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said it's almost complete...</font>

106
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this confirms it.</font>

107
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a zombie he's in the process of reanimating!</font>

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the zombies here on the island were brought back to life by Hogback.</font>

109
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the only explanation at the moment!</font>

110
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But with medicine you only save people before they die!</font>

111
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how carefully you fix a dead person's body,</font>

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you can't bring it back to life!</font>

113
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it either...</font>

114
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But maybe if we stay here and watch, we can figure out his secret.</font>

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you do?</font>

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you wish to look inside, it would be so much better for you to simply enter!</font>

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Yohoho"?!</font>

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Brook?</font>

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?!</font>

120
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! Why are you here?!</font>

121
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! "Yohoho"?
Wasn't that Brook just now?!</font>

122
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he wasn't a skeleton!</font>

123
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He had flesh and skin.</font>

124
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

125
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They found us!</font>

126
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you all see...</font>

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you never to peek into the laboratory...</font>

128
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We didn't see anything!</font>

129
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't see anything either!</font>

130
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't either!</font>

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

132
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's true!</font>

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely not the zombie you're making!</font>

134
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't say that!</font>

135
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, fine then...</font>

136
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what secrets you may have found so far, it's already too late...</font>

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In just a few minutes...</font>

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The night attack will begin.</font>

139
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Night attack?</font>

140
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other guests lost on this island will have their guard down... the night attack begins... </font>

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To get buried again just before the night attack...</font>

142
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Itching, burning, pain. It's all in your head!</font>

143
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all dead already!</font>

144
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, wake up! Soldier Zombies!</font>

145
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beaten and beaten, you will stand again and again!</font>

146
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the true terror of you zombies!</font>

147
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a bother...</font>

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Stop being so lazy!</font>

149
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop goofing around, zombies!</font>

150
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me who I am.</font>

151
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our leader!</font>

152
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our leader Absalom!</font>

153
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Leader! Leader! Leader!</i></font>

154
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whose hobby is peeping!</font>

155
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pervy-Leader!</i></font>

156
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pervsalom! Pervsalom!</i></font>

157
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pervy!</i></font>

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pervert!</i></font>

159
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

160
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-Welcome home! Lady Perona... Ladies...!</font>

161
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, Kumashi! </font>

162
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that look?! I hate it when you do that! </font>

163
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm sorry.</font>

164
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're not cute then you're not fit to serve me!</font>

165
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! Hurry!</font>

166
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's starting! It's starting!</font>

167
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for the night attack!</font>

168
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's midnight!</font>

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

170
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama!</font>

171
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to get up!</font>

172
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nin! Do it!</font>

173
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Wake up!</font>

174
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

175
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was having a nightmare!</font>

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that the best, Master?</font>

177
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since Moriah-sama has been sleeping since the last time we had a night attack four days ago...</font>

178
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've prepared you four days worth of food!</font>

179
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prey this time is pretty tough!</font>

180
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the group that brought down Enies Lobby last month...</font>

181
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy's crew!</font>

182
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll certainly be of use to Moriah-sama!</font>

183
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's really starting to pour...</font>

184
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, should we just run to the mansion then?</font>

185
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a sec!</font>

186
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see some huge thing behind the mansion.</font>

187
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like a mark...</font>

188
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog is clearing up a bit...</font>

189
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? A flag?</font>

190
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

191
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a sail?</font>

192
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sail?</font>

193
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were still following us?!</font>

195
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just as he said, that's a sail.</font>

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark...</font>

197
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is not an island, but the largest pirate ship in the world!</font>

198
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can see that at the back of the mansion is the main mast.</font>

199
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's where Gekko Moriah is!</font>

200
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, Soldier Zombie Unit...</font>

201
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The General Zombies will finish off the pirates!</font>

202
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,770
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Soldier Zombie & General Zombie
General</font>

203
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how many times you go down, just get back up quickly and crush them with fear of the undead!</font>

204
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,750
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Absalom of the Graveyard</font>

205
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,740
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Wild Zombie & Surprise Zombie
General</font>

206
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now, the bell chimed.</font>

207
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,040
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ghost Princess
Perona</font>

208
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now it's time for us to really go at it.</font>

209
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think you can escape from here, moronic pirates!</font>

210
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is everything ready?! Zombies!</font>

211
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the realm of the undead...</font>

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark!</font>

213
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be prepared to witness a nightmare!</font>

214
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, let's go!</font>

215
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Into the haunted house!</font>

216
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is this zombie research, Hogback?!</font>

217
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were experimenting here!
You've been resurrecting the dead, haven't you!?</font>

218
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, Nami, saying it so bluntly...</font>

219
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From here on you're free to think whatever you like!</font>

220
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what would make you think something like that?</font>

221
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen that woman's obituary.</font>

222
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Victoria Cindry,</font>

223
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">ten years ago, you died!</font>

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys! You went into that room?</font>

225
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-chan!</font>

226
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Samurai Ryuuma...</font>

227
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cast these fools into a world of shadows, immediately!</font>

228
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait!</font>

229
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Into that shadow world where you will never see the light again!</font>

230
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The night attack has already begun!</font>

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, well! Now that I can see you clearly, you're quite a lovely woman.</font>

232
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful!</font>

233
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you please allow me to see your panties?</font>

234
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

235
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This conversation...!</font>

236
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's exactly like with him!</font>

237
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies you've seen up until now were on a different level.</font>

238
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is a general zombie, and his body is special.</font>

239
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This man came from 
Wano Country in the New World.</font>

240
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may think I'm just exaggerating, but the story of how he cut down a dragon mid-flight is still told.</font>

241
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a legendary samurai.</font>

242
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

243
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come!</font>

244
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way to escape!</font>

245
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-san?</font>

246
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you please open up the door to that passage over there?</font>

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, I would love to have dinner afterwards.</font>

248
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What? I thought he was going to cut us...</font>

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That scared me! What was he trying to do?</font>

250
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Whatever, it doesn't matter right now! Now's our chance to run, the door is wide open!</font>

251
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

252
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done.</font>

253
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's truly a master's swordplay. After humming and walking three blocks...</font>

254
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only then do they truly realize they've been cut...</font>

255
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three-Pace Hum:</font>

256
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Notch Slash!</font>

257
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anybody home?!</font>

258
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon us!</font>

259
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just go in!</font>

260
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's locked from...</font>

261
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's open.</font>

262
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you calling "open", idiot...</font>

263
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is anyone home?</font>

264
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah!</font>

265
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that all there is to this mansion? Not even a single servant around?</font>

266
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this room? It looks like there's just been a fight.</font>

267
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be, Nami-san was involved...!</font>

268
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have a lot of guts to wander this far, knowing our master's name.</font>

269
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?! There's a pig growing out of the wall.</font>

270
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's welcome our guests!</font>

271
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, are these zombies too?</font>

272
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems whatever it is, on this island it's bound to be unusual.</font>

273
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you...</font>

274
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">hiding Nami-san!?</font>

275
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's un-ladylike to open your mouth that much.</font>

276
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you're quite pretty.</font>

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh? Really?</font>

278
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you ruined it already once you leapt out of the picture frame.</font>

279
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Twist!</font>

280
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The spear broke!</font>

281
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with his body?! Is he iron!?</font>

282
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Stop it! What are you?!</font>

283
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you one of those other weaklings' friends?</font>

284
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two Sword Style:</font>

285
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Double Slice.</font>

286
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Rice</i></font>

287
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rice? Sounds delicious!</font>

288
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flash!</font>

289
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was awful!</font>

290
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island is really fun!</font>

291
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! You nimble, little bastard!</font>

292
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you hadn't gotten in our way, we probably would've gotten along!</font>

293
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

294
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bazooka!</font>

295
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Rugbear!</font>

296
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, all done.</font>

297
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're talking about those three!</font>

298
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're fast asleep in the bedroom right now.</font>

299
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you glad?</font>

300
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're safe!</font>

301
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like we'd believe that crap.</font>

302
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's true! Go see for yourself! It's the passage just up those stairs!</font>

303
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a sec...</font>

304
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The curly-brow cook is gone...</font>

305
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? He was here just a second ago...</font>

306
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did Sanji go off to?</font>

307
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop laughing! They'll hear you.</font>

308
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must've done something at some point.</font>

309
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've lost an important man.</font>

310
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you..</font>

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But still, he's right. Sanji should be alright.</font>

312
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in this zombie mansion, we should focus on rescuing the other three, shouldn't we?</font>

313
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You all... just because you're a little stronger, don't get cocky...</font>

314
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that you've lost a friend, you'll show your true colours! Just look!</font>

315
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyways, it seems we have no other choice but to go cautiously.</font>

316
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys! Really-</font>

317
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think these kids' stories were true.</font>

318
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, let's take this pig with us as a guide.</font>

319
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go on, go!</font>

320
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you...</font>

321
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll do you good to learn how fearsome our master is.</font>

322
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our real boss is one of the Royal Seven Warlords of the Sea Gekko Mori-</font>

323
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't say it! It makes my soul freeze over!</font>

324
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wah, it's bloodcurdling just saying that name!</font>

325
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your missing friends are in trouble.</font>

326
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One, then another. Your friends will slowly disappear.</font>

327
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should turn back.</font>

328
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But before one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea Gekko-</font>

329
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, <i>our master's</i> true might, the terror will keep you from saving anyone!</font>

330
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up and stop babbling.</font>

331
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then tell that idiot Moriah this!</font>

332
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anything happens to my crew...</font>

333
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll knock him off the face of this island!</font>

334
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyways, we'll leave Sanji alone, he won't die.</font>

335
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go.</font>

336
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dear Master,</font>

337
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For some reason, some very formidable guys have gotten into the mansion.</font>

338
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the surprised Surprise Zombies.</font>

339
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Everybody circle the mansion!</font>

340
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">屋敷を囲めェ～</font>

341
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Let's Fiesta Night!</font>

342
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">レッツフィエスタナイッッ</font>

343
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Not a single pirate will get away!</font>

344
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">海賊達は一人たりとも逃がさない</font>

345
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Everybody! Zombie Night!</font>

346
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">エッビッバァリィ～ゾンビナイッ</font>

347
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Round and round and turn and die!</font>

348
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">ラウンド andラウンandターンandダーイ</font>

349
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Zombie night!!!</font>

350
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">ゾンビナーイッ！！！</font>

351
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now all of our prey has wandered into our territory!</font>

352
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tonight you may rampage as much as you please!</font>

353
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awaken! General Zombies!</font>

354
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be revived! Ancient Warriors!</font>

355
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat pirate crew has eight members.</font>

356
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Catch them soundly and bring them to our master!</font>

357
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's move!</font>

358
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You horrifying General Zombies! </font>
