His Armament is too hard!</font>

135
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you consider Vinsmoke Sanji to be a friend,
then leave him alone.</font>

136
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a prince of a mighty kingdom.
His status is far greater than yours!</font>

137
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He will have a proud wife and live here...</font>

138
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">with his every desire catered to!</font>

139
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You selfishly claim you will take back your friend,
rather than allowing him to be happy?</font>

140
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When his annoying former captain finds him,</font>

141
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that proud prince will no doubt say...</font>

142
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Begone from my sight, 
you miserable, lowlife pirate!"</font>

143
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,420

147
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what can a balloon do?</font>

148
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me say it one more time!</font>

149
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Begone from my sight, you miserable, lowlife pirate!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't insult Sanji!</font>

156
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he's happy
and doesn't want to come back,</font>

157
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he'd never talk to us like that!</font>

158
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna go see Sanji!</font>

159
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum-Gum...</font>

160
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't push your luck!</font>

161
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pretzel...</font>

165
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

166
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did a good job breaking...</font>

167
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">my armor!</font>

168
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

169
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who am I?</font>

170
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty sure I already introduced myself as Sweet Commander Cracker.</font>

171
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,110
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="55"><font color="#000000">"Thousand Arms" Cracker</font></font></font>

172
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,110

173
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really liked that armor...</font>

174
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Armor?
No way! He coughed up blood!</font>

175
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– That was jam!
– Jam?!</font>

176
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since I'm a craftsman at heart,
I also make sure that it tastes good.</font>

177
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a biscuit man 
with the powers of the Bis-Bis Fruit!</font>

178
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can produce and manipulate an infinite number of biscuits!</font>

179
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To shape them into anything...</font>

180
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush Biscuit!</font>

181
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if I craft it carefully...</font>

182
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! It's the face of a hardened warrior!</font>

183
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The form that biscuits have taken</font>

184
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has changed throughout history, depending on the baker.</font>

185
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very few people have forced me to reveal my true identity.</font>

186
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just look at the picture on my wanted poster, which was issued by the World Government.</font>

187
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not me. It's my armor!</font>

188
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I despise pain. I can't even 
stand the prick of a needle!</font>

189
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that's why I use my armor to fight.</font>

190
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I clap my hands, they multiply.
That is the power and beauty of my biscuits!</font>

191
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have unlimited power at my disposal!</font>

192
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You had to give your all to defeat...</font>

193
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a biscuit soldier that I can remake over and over.</font>

194
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand now why you will never see
Vinsmoke Sanji again?</font>

195
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I will definitely return.</i></font>

196
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna see Sanji!</font>

197
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Learning that there are people you can't beat
no matter the effort you put in</font>

198
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is a mark of true growth, brat!</font>

199
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll teach you a lesson!</font>

200
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– We can't do it!
– We have no chance!</font>

201
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

202
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess we'll be safe here.</font>

203
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're no match for him!</font>

204
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here.</font>

205
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did she get there?!</font>

206
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you close your mouth,
you'll be sealing your doom.</font>

207
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if all of you shriveled up 
and withered away, I wouldn't care at all!</font>

208
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

209
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a horrible person.</font>

210
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sweet Commander Cracker,
or his mother, Emperor Big Mom.</font>

211
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which is scarier?</font>

212
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're scarier than both of them!</font>

213

<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Brûlée's Mirro-world</font></font></font>

Listen, Carrot!</font>

216
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a great idea,
so from now on, please call me Big Bro Chopper!</font>

217
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh, okay.</font>

218
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good!</font>

219
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what is your idea, Chobro?!</font>

220
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chobro?!</font>

221
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!
Short for Big Bro Chopper, Chobro!</font>

222
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, okay.</font>

223
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like this world of mirrors</font>

224
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,640

226
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead of escaping from here,
we should take advantage of Brûlée's ability!</font>

227
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How?</font>

228
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,500
