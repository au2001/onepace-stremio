135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why now, all of a sudden?</font>

136
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe it's because we blew up the mini-slimes?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it appears that
the big one on the other shore is shrinking.</font>

145
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,230

146
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or maybe it's getting smaller because it's launching itself over here piece by piece?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably.  It'll be safe in the lab, though.</font>

187
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Vergo!</font>

188
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines outside are from G-5. 
They're your own men!</font>

189
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you planning to let them all die?</font>

190
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's about right.</font>

191
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

192
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what a lovely collection of characters we have in this cage.</font>

00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quite a sight.</font>

195
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, you're right!
You captured me and Smoke-man back in Alabasta!</font>

196
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut the hell up.</font>

197
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,630

you don't care what's going on, do you?</font>

198
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san, what do these feelings mean?
What should I do?</font>

199
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems your worst case scenario was right.</font>

200
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A member of G-5 would have to be
covering up the kidnappings by lying to the media.{cp589}</i></font>

201
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means that Caesar used Vergo
to change the kidnapping reports into shipwrecks.</font>

202
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words,
the corruption comes from the very top of G-5.</font>

203
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You could say that's characteristic of G-5,
but it's a disgrace to the entire Navy!</font>

204
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could you do this?!</font>

205
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, is he some kind of bad guy?</font>

206
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It certainly appears to be so.</font>

207
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't feel bad for not realizing it.</font>

208
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It isn't like Vergo actually betrayed the Marines...</font>

209
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since he was really a pirate the entire time.</font>

210
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pirate... <i>What?!</i></font>

211
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  Before he was famous,
he joined the Navy on Joker's orders.</font>

212
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's slipped by unnoticed for fifteen years,
slowly gaining in rank.</font>

213
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker has no other Marine
more useful and trustworthy than him.</font>

214
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo's been a member of Joker's crew
from the very start.</font>

215
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could...</font>

216
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker... Wasn't that
the name of that broker from the underworld?</font>

217
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pathetic that I couldn't smell this rat.</font>

218
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so hard on yourself.</font>

219
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I prefer to think that the rat deserves admiration
when it evades the great White Hunter, Smoker-kun.</font>

220
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to be very careful
ever since you transferred in from HQ.</font>

221
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels good now that I don't have to worry
about you anymore.</font>

222
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And even if my true nature was revealed,
I have a plan to handle it.</font>

223
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must know why
I'm not worried about telling you all this, don't you?</font>

224
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-Admiral Smoker and Captain Tashigi...</font>

225
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to shut your mouths
by making sure that you die here.</font>

226
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar will take care of my subordinates outside.</font>

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be done.  This is important turf for Joker.</font>

228
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We cannot allow anyone to return alive
once they've figured out what's happening here.</font>

229
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always,
we'll be able to make it look like an accident.</font>

230
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo!</font>

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Traf.  Who's this Joker?</font>

232
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used to be part of his crew as well.</font>

233
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how I know Vergo.</font>

234
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker is merely his title as an underworld broker.</font>

235
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You already know him, quite well.</font>

236
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

237
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's one of the seven world-famous pirates.</font>

238
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A member of the World Government sanctioned Seven Warlords of the Sea.</font>

239
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Donquixote Doflamingo.</font>

240
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

241
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So...</font>

242
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're the one who kidnapped these kids?!</font>

243
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he doing here?
Did Luffy and the others go the wrong way?</font>

244
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've done something terrible.</font>

245
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Terrible?</font>

246
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you take them away?</font>

247
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you see that the children are suffering?</font>

248
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

249
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, don't be an idiot!  Cut it out, Nami!</font>

250
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And <i>whose</i> fault is it that they're suffering?!</font>

251
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!  Didn't Law say he was
a Logia user with a bounty of 300 million?</font>

252
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What drugs have you
been giving to these young children?</font>

253
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of them really want to go home!
Their parents must be searching for them too!</font>

254
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're definitely going to
take the children away from this place!</font>

255
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They don't look like they want to go home.</font>

256
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

257
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on!</font>

258
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

259
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait!</font>

260
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go!  You don't want
to go back to the laboratory, do you?!</font>

261
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way!</font>

262
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

263
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  Come on home, children.</font>

264
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop!</font>

265
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't go to him!</font>

266
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you want to go home?!</font>

267
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch me!</font>

268
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cockroach!</font>

269
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from me, cockroach!</font>

270
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, are you alright?!</font>

271
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yeah.</font>

272
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get cocky, you bastard!</font>

273
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Usopp!</font>

274
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me!  We've got to use force to stop them.  It's the only way!</font>

275
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're hallucinating!  He just called you a cockroach!</font>

276
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

277
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">these children are victims!</font>

278
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They haven't done anything wrong!</font>

279
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take these chains off me!</font>

280
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts!</font>

281
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we don't do something...</font>

282
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">these kids will kill us!</font>

283
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then direct that anger...</font>

284
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">at him!</font>

285
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take them off!</font>

286
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take these chains off me!</font>

287
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got to be kidding!</font>

288
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They broke their chains?!</font>

289
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magnificent!  How strong you have become!</font>

290
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That little...</font>

291
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy.</font>

292
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master.</font>

293
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please...</font>

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you wait, damn gas bastard!</font>

295
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The most effective thing against gas would be...</font>

296
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly...</font>

297
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire Bird Star!</font>

298
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay back, kids!</font>

299
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you expecting me to explode?</font>

300
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you know that I have gas powers.</font>

301
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you see,
I can extinguish fire before it touches me!</font>

302
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison gas isn't the only kind of gas there is.</font>

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Air itself is a gas as well.</font>

304
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that means that I can control the air around me.</font>

305
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remove the oxygen and all flame dies out...</font>

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and you become unable to breathe!</font>

307
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like so!</font>

308
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

309
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Ball...</font>

310
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thundercloud...</font>

311
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master.</font>

312
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Candy.</font>

313
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy.</font>

314
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did I hear you say that
you think Straw Hat missed me?</font>

315
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As a matter of fact, we did meet!</font>

316
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suffocated him and the other two!</font>

317
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

318
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now!</font>

319
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

320
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gimme!  Gimme!</font>

321
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Children.  Only good kids
who return to the laboratory get candy.</font>

322
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be good!  We'll be good kids!</font>

323
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then you can be patient for a little longer, can you not?</font>

324
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well, but first...</font>

325
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">these demons took you away
and made your disease worse.</font>

326
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Exterminate them!</font>

327
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take those big pipes...</font>

328
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and smash their heads in!</font>

329
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

330
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop... it.</font>

331
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head... spinning...</font>

332
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar!</font>

333
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownie!</font>

334
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His name is Brownbeard!</font>

335
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

336
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see now!</font>

337
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you again?</font>

338
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I remember!
My powerful subordinate, Brownbeard!</font>

339
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you forget that I even <i>existed?!</i></font>

340
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course not!</font>

341
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?</font>

342
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like you were badly burned. It's painful just to look at you.</font>

343
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were the one who ordered them to do this to me!</font>

344
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Brownbeard?{Copy-paste from 592}</i></font>

345
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're on the hit list as well.</i></font>

346
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's an idiot so he's easy to use,
but he has become a burden.</i></font>

347
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We don't need him anymore.</i></font>

348
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Kill him.{End copy-paste from 592}</i></font>

349
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Cool Brothers, am I right?</font>

350
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's why you were burned!</font>

351
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I trusted you!</font>

352
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't be so upset.</font>

353
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You survived an attack from the Cool Brothers.</font>

354
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're quite lucky, really!</font>

355
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

356
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar!</font>

357
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Children!  It's dangerous here!</font>

358
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get aboard the gas balloon outside!</font>

359
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get away from this place!</font>

360
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!  Don't go with him!</font>

361
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar!</font>

362
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that you deceived me doesn't really matter.</font>

363
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... don't care.</font>

364
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you will return my crew to me!</font>

365
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let them suffer the same fate that I did!</font>

366
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Imbecile!  You have no crew!</font>

367
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of them, including you,
belong to <i>me</i> </font>now, remember?

368
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long are you gonna keep pretending that you're a captain?</font>

369
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the most pathetic pirate scum
in the New World!</font>

370
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami!  We've gotta chase after the kids.</font>

371
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

372
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They will continue to obey me,
believing that I am their god of salvation!</font>

373
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just too stupid to realize...</font>

374
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that they're merely being kept alive
so I can use them as human guinea pigs!</font>

378
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

379
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gastanet!</font>

380

382
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,840

383
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have successfully retrieved the children.</font>

384
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,900

385
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the preparations you ordered us to perform have been carried out, Master.</font>

386
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,760

387
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:08,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we can begin the live broadcast
of our fun experiment as soon as Smiley arrives?</font>

388
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

389
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.  Connect me to all receivers.</font>

390
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,360

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you are lucky to get to see this.</font>

394
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gas weapon I am about to show you...</font>

395
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is even more effective
than the one from four years ago,</font>

396
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and it's an item that the trash
from the World Government could never produce.</font>

397
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uninvited guests
wandered onto my island earlier today...</font>

398
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I will be performing this experiment on them.</font>

399
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Conquest.  War.  Dominion.</font>

400
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This weapon has many possible uses.</font>

401
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it is to your liking, shall we make a deal?</font>

402
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you interested
in this weapon of mass destruction?</font>

403
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah.</font>

404
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... it can't hurt to see it in action.</font>
