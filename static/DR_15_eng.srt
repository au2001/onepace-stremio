31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I felt that there was something strange about him when he ran out of the palace earlier.</font>

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But for him to do something like this...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since this is no longer a matter we can handle ourselves, I've contacted the Navy.</font>

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you Doflamingo's subordinates?!</font>

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monet, release Viola-sama!</font>

52

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you guys do something to his majesty?!</font>

53
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, things are going to get busy.</font>

54
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must clean out the royal palace.</font>

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is the Riku Royal Army doing this?!</font>

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!</font>

57
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm forced to hurt my citizens...</font>

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather just die!</font>

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone please, kill me!</font>

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you doing this, King Riku?</font>

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have we done something wrong?</font>

62
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were always righteous.</font>

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were...</font>

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the king we were proud of.</font>

65
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you asked for our money...</font>

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gave you everything we had.</font>

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've always thought of us first and foremost.</font>

68
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were proud of our king!</font>

69
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku...</font>

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku has trampled on our feelings!</font>

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's trying to kill us and steal our money!</font>

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For his own greed, he's treating us like trash!</font>

73
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse you, King Riku!</font>

74
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate you!</font>

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're...</font>

76
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the scum of humanity!</font>

77
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Riku Royal Army is coming!</font>

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, get out of there, run away!</font>

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Save-</font><font size="20"></font>

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you people?</font>

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've come to save this country.</font>

82
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Donquixote Doflamingo.{we're backstreet boys, the ones who sing "I don't care who you're, where you're from, what you did as long as you save me" ^^}</font>

83
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He's a pirate.</font>

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they beat the Riku Royal Army.</font>

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a beautiful dance, King Riku.</font>

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tr√©bol, Pica, Diamante. Go clean up the trash.</font>

87
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it!</font>

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're saved.</font>

89
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Doflamingo! Doflamingo! Doflamingo!</i></font>

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fall into depravity, embrace violence.</font>

91
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In just one night, the country fell under Doflamingo's control.</font>

92
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a story, it's like a nightmare.</font>

93
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a cunning man.</font>

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I-I'll never forgive you, Doflamingo!</font>

95
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the time, we too believed that King Riku had gone crazy, and approached the new king, Doflamingo.</font>

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was the result.</font>

97
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am ashamed that we couldn't believe in King Riku.</font>

98
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, it's really too bad.</font>

99
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone loved the king so much, yet he died while being cursed for a crime he never committed.</font>

100
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, King Riku is still alive.</font>

101
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo wanted the ability of the princess at the time, Viola-sama.</font>

102
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So she gave him a condition.</font>

103
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you promise not to kill my father, then</i></font>

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I will serve under you!</i></font>

105
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She is alive right now as Doflamingo's subordinate.</font>

106
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She changed her name to Violet, and is now a commander in the Family.</font>

107
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Commander?</font>

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, thanks to the princess, King Riku is...</font>

109
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, he is alive somewhere in this country.</font>

110
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, the pain he has gone through these past ten years is unimaginable.</font>

111
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And how hard it must have been for Viola-sama.</font>

112
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fear, anger, tears!</font>

113
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder how she's spent the last ten years.</font>

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was controlled just like King Riku was, and forced to hurt the citizens.</font>

115
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The anger of those soldiers must be just as large.</font>

116
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weren't King Riku's soldiers killed on that night?</font>

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some were killed and some bowed down to Doflamingo.</font>

118
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They now live as his guards.</font>

119
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They changed sides!</font>

120
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe they were forced to make a difficult decision.</font>

121
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't screw with us!</i></font>

122
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They were under orders from the crazed King Riku.</i></font>

123
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Allow me to make them my subordinates.</i></font>

124
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's the case then they make me want to cry!</font>

125
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every last one of them!</font>

126
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldiers that were killed, and the ones that bowed down.</font>

127
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we add them up, they're too few to make up the army of a country.</font>

128
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

129
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean that I have lost memories as well.</font>

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fraland. I showed you in town, correct?</font>

131
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We remember everything from when we were human,</font>

132
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but everyone else, even our families, forgot everything about us.</font>

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody knows they've forgotten about people important to them.</font>

134
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the greatest tragedy of Dressrosa,
and it goes for us toys as well.</font>

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So among all those toys walking around town, there may be some of your old comrades.</font>

136
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you yourself have forgotten them so you don't know?</font>

137
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Exactly.</font>

138
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, everyone who was turned into a toy harbors hatred toward Doflamingo.</font>

139
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo has buried anyone who opposed him.</font>

140
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means that in the country's darkness, there are countless people who oppose him.</font>

141
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That unknown number of tragedies{Yeah this phrasing might be a bit awkward, but I really feel we should keep this line in... Partially because the manga-chapter this episode was based off was literally NAMED "Number of tragedies". -Starfish} is the key to our plan.</font>

142
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, so that's it.</font>

143
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what you meant when you said you still have a chance.{Isis: I changed the line a bit to match what was said in ep 652, and I didn't like the previous phrasing anyway :P }</font>

144
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, with just these numbers, taking on a Warlord and his crew would be near impossible.</font>

145
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if every toy in the country were to join us,
then that would make for quite the fighting force.</font>

146
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait up a bit!</font>

147
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you trying to go after Doflamingo as well?!</font>

148
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our only goal is the destruction of the factory.</font>

149
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we've done that, we're getting out of this country.</font>

150
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that right, Robin?</font>

151
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't forgive Doflamingo.</font>

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today is the day of our long awaited final battle!</font>

153
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The event of this morning was a challenge to us!</font>

154
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the fact that Usoland appeared here today is no coincidence!</font>

155
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is the heavens telling us to fight!</font>

156
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The event of this morning?</font>

157
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Doflamingo temporarily abdicated his throne.</font>

158
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh that, yeah, we were the-</font><font size="20"></font>

159
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you imagine our delight when we heard the news?</font>

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought a miracle had occurred.</font>

161
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then the notice that it was misinformation.</font>

162
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To us, it was like being dropped from heaven into the depths of hell.</font>

163
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it was only natural for us to make today the day we fight him.</font>

164
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Umm, I'm really sorry.</font>

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,800
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Beneath Dressrosa</font>

166
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Even though you're retired, you brought a ship over here?</font>

167

<font face="impress bt" size="45">Scrap Yard</font>

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well I don't have anyone to take over the Happou Navy.</font>

169
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only I had a grandchild.</font>

170
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

171
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So things aren't going well, even for the villains.</font>

172
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it just my imagination?</font>

173
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel like there's a gap in my memory.</font>

174
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had the same feeling ten years ago.</font>

175
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell, where on earth am I going?!</font>

176
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gramps, save me!</font>

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,750

178
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did they do to me, the maverick warrior, Jeet?!</font>

185
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,510

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

205
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I guess it was unavoidable, seeing who the target was.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it doesn't really matter whether you succeed or not.</font>

267
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,410

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Chopper. Use that one to contact Usopp.</font>

291
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,760

310
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It turns out he was the captain of this army.</font>

311

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the gang gathered here are planning to fight Doflamingo, today.</font>

329
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We destroy the factory, and then let Doflamingo live so that we can use him to get to Kaidou.</font>
