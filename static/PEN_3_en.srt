91
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It could break out of so many places!</font>

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Are you really gonna give us this?!</font>

93
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's double the size of Merry!</font>

94
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a big sail!</font>

95
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it a sloop?!</font>

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show me the kitchen! The kitchen!</font>

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A splendid ship!</font>

98
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what kind of big flower is that on the ship's bow.</font>

99
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I was sure it was a lion.</font>

100
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The inside is also awesome!</font>

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a lawn deck!</font>

102
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feels so good!</font>

103
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A slide!</font>

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can also do gardening.</font>

105
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice for relaxing.</font>

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the kitchen?</font>

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must really have mobility with that huge gaff sail!</font>

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's called a brigantine sail.</font>

109
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sloop is a ship that can sail beyond people's imaginations.</font>

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It lives and dies by the order of the navigator.</font>

111
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make my skills roar! I'll do my best!</font>

112
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I also want to take a look.</font>

113
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has the refrigerator with a lock that I saw in my dreams!</font>

114
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even a gigantic oven!</font>

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, thank you!</font>

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship is the best!</font>

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, old man Ice.</font>

118
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Franky?</font>

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to thank him.</font>

120
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems he doesn't want to see you.</font>

121
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to invite him as your shipwright, right?</font>

122
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it right.</font>

124
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've decided he will be my shipwright!</font>

125
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That might be the problem.</font>

126
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't want to?</font>

127
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The opposite.</font>

128
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he was invited face to face he wouldn't be able to refuse.</font>

129
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why he went to hide.</font>

130
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, perhaps his true feelings are to go with you guys out at sea.</font>

131
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must know pretty well how much he cares for this dream ship he's giving to you.</font>

132
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! There's an aquarium in this place?!</font>

133
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An aquarium? Amazing!</font>

134
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky really has a liking for you all from the bottom of his heart.</font>

135
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he's always thought of it as his duty, staying on this island.</font>

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Duty?</font>

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, if you ask me, it's just a stupid obsession.</font>

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you really want him to go with you...</font>

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only method to choose is...</font>

140
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to use force to get him.</font>

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the only method for his release.</font>

142
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By force?</font>

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want him to go, but...</font>

144
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that really okay?!</font>

145
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother! Why did you come back?</font>

146
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do I need a reason?</font>

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Franky House!</font>

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my house!</font>

149
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

150
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure of what you're saying, Brother?!</font>

151
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't Brother want to go with
Straw Hat-san and the others?!</font>

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a stupid thing to say...</font>

153
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course not...!</font>

154
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey look!</font>

155
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With skills like yours you can't even build a house.</font>

156
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just came from asking
Straw Hat-san and the others,</font>

157
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To take Brother out to the sea!</font>

158
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

159
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mind your own business!</font>

160
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that guy has already decided to take you as his shipwright!</font>

161
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do I have to become a pirate?!</font>

162
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd know if you could see it!</font>

163
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time we've seen Brother build a ship, but...</font>

164
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were amazed you could make such a happy face.</font>

165
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen Brother have so much fun.</font>

166
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother.</font>

167
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You knew the Straw Hats were looking for a shipwright, right?</font>

168
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why you ran away, right?!</font>

169
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this, Brother!</font>

170
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wanted poster!</font>

171
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought, it came out.</font>

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use staying with us anymore!</font>

173
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't want to be a burden to you!</font>

174
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop being so cocky!</font>

175
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the marines?!</font>

176
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who picked you up from these backstreets when you were dying!</font>

177
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm not here you probably can't probably survive by yourselves...</font>

178
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got his pants!</font>

179
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pants?</font>

180
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why the pants...?</font>

181
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!</font>

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't give them back!</font>

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep passing the pants!</font>

184
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't give them back no matter what!</font>

185
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back my pants, damn it!</font>

186
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are my best!</font>

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scatter!</font>

188
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

189
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine then!</font>

190
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's coming after us!</font>

191
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know that even you all can't do anything against me!</font>

192
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it's just one of you!</font>

193
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deliver them to Straw Hat-san!</font>

194
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get them to the scrap island!</font>

195
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong Right!</font>

196
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

197
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To southeast!</font>

198
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with all the ruckus?!</font>

199
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pervert...!</font>

200
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky is rampaging!</font>

201
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again?!</font>

202
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! The town could be destroyed!</font>

203
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, damn it!</font>

204
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! That guy isn't wearing anything!</font>

205
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! Look at the...!</font>

206
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get the kids inside the houses!</font>

207
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them see the pervert!</font>

208
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong Right!</font>

209
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's committing a crime, arrest him!</font>

210
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Deliver the pants!</font>

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get on the cornetfish!</font>

212
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Go!</font>

213
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The backstreets has become a battlefield!</font>

214
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, my leg is...!</font>

215
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

216
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this it?</font>

217
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Pass them over here!</font>

218
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw them here!</font>

219
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san!</font>

220
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

221
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely received them!</font>

222
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...!</font>

223
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

224
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you like the ship?!</font>

225
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen such an amazing ship before!</font>

227
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

228
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pervert! Get out of here!</font>

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give him the death penalty!</font>

230
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perverted bastard!</font>

231
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

232
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It includes my super designs!</font>

233
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the answer to all of your requests!</font>

234
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see the Soldier Dock System I invented?!</font>

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not yet!</font>

236
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll surely be the one you'll like the most!</font>

237
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the fish pond?</font>

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw it!</font>

239
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you put the fish you've caught in the fish pond, you can see them in the large aquarium in the room below.</font>

240
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an aquarium observation room!</font>

241
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone should have a meal there once.</font>

242
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can always eat fresh fish!</font>

243
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm looking forward to it!</font>

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That ship, for me and also for you is...</font>

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The supreme dream ship!</font>

246
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard...!</font>

247
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back my pants!</font>

248
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

249
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

250
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Here he comes!</font>

251
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you Roronoa-san and the other guy!</font>

252
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to us!</font>

253
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get in there!</font>

254
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Target; Scrap Island!</font>

255
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you trying to do?!</font>

256
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Franky Family special product!</font>

257
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Shoot Anything Cannon!</font>

258
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey you!</font>

259
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking aroun...!</font>

260
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead of his pants, he went there first!</font>

261
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grab on, Chopper!</font>

262
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

263
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rocket!</font>

264
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's something accursed!</font>

265
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! It's just the pervert!</font>

266
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>

267
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,290

268
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this situation?!</font>

269
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

270
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for the ship!</font>

271
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the best ship!</font>

272
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll treasure it!</font>

273
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

274
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,200

277
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put on your pants!</font>

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,490

282
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back my pants, Straw Hat.</font>

283
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, join our crew.</font>

284
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be stupid!</font>

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think just because you got my pants, you can make me your crewmate!</font>

320
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have been grabbed! Ouch!</font>

321
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be smashed, Robin!</font>

326
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want him to be still a man when he becomes our crewmate!</font>

327
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't take them!</font>

328
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,590

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky is taking damage!</font>

331
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? It's like a scream when a chicken's head is being tied up!</font>

332
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel bad for him.</font>

333
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he's a pervert.</font>

334
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like when a treasure is in front of a pirate and he doesn't want to let go.</font>

335
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I don't receive a good reason,</font>

336
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not letting you go.</font>

337
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That's why...!</font>

338
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you I can't leave this island...</font>

339
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm grateful to you guys...</font>

340
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's something impossible for me to do.</font>

341
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to go with you but...</font>

342
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are still things I must do here.</font>

343
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I gave you the ship.</font>

344
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I quit being a shipwright to begin with.</font>

345
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why, that one is the only ship I'll ever build again.</font>

346
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had only one wish...</font>

347
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that is.. the dream ship over there!</font>

348
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Franky...</font>

349
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That still hasn't become the dream ship you talked about.</font>

350
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dream ship?</i></font>

351
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's right!</i></font>

352
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That ship won't be one that will be completed just with the blueprints.</i></font>

353
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It'll sail many seas!</i></font>

354
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Overcome many battles and difficulties...</i></font>

355
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And when it reaches the end of the sea...</i></font>

356
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's when it'll be called a dream ship!</i></font>

357
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then, someday, when I complete that awesome ship,</i></font>

358
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll board it and become its shipwright!</i></font>

359
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm looking forward to see that fateful day!</i></font>

360
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>By then the ship might be all worn out but,</i></font>

361
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Surely, it'll shine much more than any other ship out there!</i></font>

362
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How is it? Amazing, isn't it, Tom-san?</i></font>

363
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yes, it's amazing.</i></font>

364
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And if you get on it and take care of it...</i></font>

365
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You will have surpassed me!</i></font>

366
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's that pirate blood of yours.</i></font>

367
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dumb-Franky, do you really think you can surpass Tom-san?</i></font>

368
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What was that?!</i></font>

369
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Bastard! What're you doing?!</i></font>

370
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Damn Dumb-Franky!</i></font>

371
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What, if you're a man do it with a bang!</i></font>

372
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The things I wanted to do have changed!</font>

373
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The things you wanted?</font>

374
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're wrong.</font>

375
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You now, have done everything you had to do in this island.</font>

376
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Atonement!</font>

377
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That day...</font>

378
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You blamed yourself and regretted the capture of Tom-san.</font>

379
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Tom-san has already forgiven you.</font>

380
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Showing you a new path.</font>

381
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You collected thugs from the backstreets,</font>

382
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Made a name for yourselves as bounty hunters,</font>

383
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protected this island from plunderers,</font>

384
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You protected everything Tom-san loved in this Water Metropolis,</font>

385
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything to atone for your guilt.</font>

386
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You might not see it from that point of view.</font>

387
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I don't...</font>

388
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't intend that in the least.</font>

389
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You stopped making those ships you liked, to keep living.</font>

390
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you plan to keep doing that from here on?</font>

391
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though Tom-san has already forgiven you,</font>

392
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I have already forgiven you,</font>

393
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't change anything, right?</font>

394
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time...</font>

395
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To forgive yourself, Franky!</font>

396
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Live for your dream now!</font>

397
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What...?!</font>

398
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bag?</font>

399
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the luggage for your trip, Brother!</font>

400
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it, you!</font>

401
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! The Franky Family!</font>

402
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

403
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

404
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys...!</font>

405
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother, please forgive us for everything!</font>

406
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really sorry!</font>

407
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really sorry!</font>

408
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're prepared to take any punishment.</font>

409
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're idiots, so...!</font>

410
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was all we could plan!</font>
