00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Don't just sit there! The boss needs our help!</font>

138
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! I'll go!</font>

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...the Straw Hats!</font>

140
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going! Move!</font>

141
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going too!</font>

142
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This orthodox-rules three-coin game Davy Back Fight is now over!</font>

143
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

144
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

145
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez could you have been any more reckless?!</font>

146
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this! And this!</font>

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit poking him so much! He's seriously hurt you jerk!</font>

148
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He had us worried the entire time...</font>

149
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afro power my butt.</font>

150
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afros really are powerful Nami-san!</font>

151
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! He's conscious!</font>

152
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Huh?!</font>

153
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The game! How'd the game end?!</font>

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I won... Was it just a dream?!</font>

155
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. You won.</font>

156
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a relief...</font>

157
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was never worried in the least!</font>

158
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar.</font>

159
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I think about it, I've got no reason to be a pirate for any other ship.</font>

160
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

161
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't be moving yet!</font>

162
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Straw Hat!</font>

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you tarnish my legendary undefeated streak?!</font>

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

165
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put 'er there brother!</font>

166
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

167
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right Boss!</font>

168
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spiteful Shoulder Throw!</font>

169
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

170
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you that stupid?</font>

171
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten the rules?</font>

172
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Choose your 500 people already!</font>

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! The final exchange awaits!</font>

174
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give us your pirate flag!</font>

175
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

176
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't be serious! You'd strip us of our pride just like that?!</font>

177
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't need your sail. You need it to go places after all.</font>

178
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! He's so merciful!</font>

179
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But our symbol's on there!</font>

180
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you expect us to use the sail?!</font>

181
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need your pity! Just take what's yours!</font>

182
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right.</font>

183
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since your mark is all we need I'll draw a new one over it for you.</font>

184
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That way you can keep your sail.</font>

185
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat... You're such a...!</font>

186
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Sail: Fox</i></font>

187
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There!</font>

188
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This sucks...!</font>

189
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow they're really grateful!</font>

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No we ain't!</font>

191
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Straw Hat!</font>

192
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get you for this!</font>

193
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do they ever stop being comedians?</font>

194
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There there. I won't ride on stilts ever again.</font>

195
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can follow the village together now however many years it takes.</font>

196
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You folks...!</font>

197
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I went and kicked their butts!</font>

198
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really hurt...</font>

199
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is nothing new.</font>

200
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you...</font>

201
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah so that's why you accepted their challenge.</font>

202
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not like you wouldn't have otherwise though.</font>

203
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man you're rude!</font>

204
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What is this?!</font>

205
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yikes!</font>

206
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the champion! Yo!</font>

207
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not another weirdo...</font>

208
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Champion of what?!</font>

209
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the world champion of hole-digging!</font>

210
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm challenging my own record as we speak!</font>

211
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of challenge has you wrecking the old stilts guy's house?!</font>

212
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Old stilts guy"...?</font>

213
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Can you manage while I'm gone?</i></font>

214
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sure. But make sure you come back as a champion!</i></font>

215
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But of course I will!</i></font>

216
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I promise!</i></font>

217
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be? Are you...?!</font>

218
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa!</font>

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Littonto!</font>

221
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I missed you! I missed you so much!</font>

222
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You went and grew so much since I last saw you...!</font>

223
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry for worrying you...</font>

224
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's your grandson?</font>

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I missed my grandpa so much and that devotion led me to hole-digging!</font>

226
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And before I knew it becoming the greatest digger in the world had become my greatest goal in life...</font>

227
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't this great, old guy?!</font>

228
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. I don't know how to begin thanking you...</font>

229
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never forget what you've done for us!</font>

230
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

231
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care on your way home!</font>

232
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You too! I pray for your safe journey!</font>

233
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right, men!</font>

234
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go find a shipwright!</font>

235
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>
