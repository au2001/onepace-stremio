just fret for a little longer!</font>

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get going already!</font>

85
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I actually would've preferred
to do it at my own pace!</font>

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there! We'll run away as soon
as the bomb around her neck is off!</font>

98
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to hurry before the
warship and admiral get here!</font>

99
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?!</font>

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The navy's already here Straw Hat-ya.</font>

101
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

102
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that bear?</font>

103
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've had the place surrounded
before the auctions even began.</font>

104
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Navy Headquarters has a post
on this archipelago you see.</font>

105
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please leave the area immediately!
It's all right! We're here!</font>

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's it look inside?!</font>

107
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've finished evacuating the patrons!</font>

108
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three Celestial Dragons are still inside!</font>

109
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring them out at once!</font>

110
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn pirates! Don't think
you'll get out of here unhurt!</font>

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno who they wanted to catch</font>

112
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I doubt they expected anyone
would beat up the Celestial Dragons.</font>

113
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was an interesting show
you gave Straw Hat-ya crew.</font>

114
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be Trafalgar Law.</font>

115
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy. He's a pirate.</font>

116
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! The bear too?</font>

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The 500 million Berries!</font>

118
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-P-Please wait Saint Shalria!</font>

119
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That item hasn't been paid for yet!</font>

120
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait Saint Shalria! Saint Shalria!</font>

121
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quiet commoner!</font>

122
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap! Camie-chan's in trouble!</font>

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit your squirming!</font>

124
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn...!</font>

125
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Saint Shalria!</font>

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See Mr. Giant?</font>

127
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The place is in a real uproar.
I'd say the auction's over.</font>

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've stolen some money now</font>

129
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so guess I'll head back
to the gambling houses...</font>

130
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're one disagreeable old man.</font>

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were only here to get some money?</font>

132
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was hoping for a chance to steal
from whoever bought me too...</font>

133
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I guess it wasn't meant to be.</font>

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh right. I'm all out.
First thing is more alcohol.</font>

135
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think about it.</font>

136
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know about you but I wouldn't
want an old man like me for a slave.</font>

137
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Looks like we've
garnered some attention...</font>

138
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that old man and that giant?!</font>

139
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are today's merchandise! How
did they get out of their cell?!</font>

140
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They don't have collars!
How did they unlock them?!</font>

141
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do we do?</font>

142
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean? Catching people is
outside of our field of expertise!</font>

143
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't hold back an unshackled giant!</font>

144
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Rayleigh!</font>

145
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean Rayleigh the coating craftsman?!</font>

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one is he?!</font>

147
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Is that you Hachi?! It is!</font>

148
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's good to see you again!
What are you doing here?!</font>

149
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you get that injury?!</font>

150
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No that's okay you needn't say a thing!</font>

151
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In short... I see. I understand
the situation now.</font>

152
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure got yourself into
a heap of trouble Hachi.</font>

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you folks saved him?</font>

154
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then...</font>

155
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he...</font>

156
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It couldn't be!</font>

157
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! How?! What did you just do?!</font>

158
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is this old guy?!</font>

159
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.</font>

160
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been wanting to meet you...</font>

161
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Monkey D. Luffy.</font>

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,670
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Sabaody Archipelago Lawless Zone</font>

163
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad! This town-- this
whole archipelago-- is in danger!</font>

164
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy supposedly kicked
a Celestial Dragon's ass!</font>

165
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the auction house on Grove #1!</font>

166
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

167
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently Kid and Law are there too!</font>

168
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Straw Hat bastard!
What was he thinking?!</font>

169
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't he know that an admiral
from Navy Headquarters</font>

170
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will bring a warship here if
anyone hurts a Celestial Dragon?!</font>

171
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has our ship been coated?!</font>

172
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was completed yesterday!</font>

173
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We set sail for Fish-Man Island immediately!</font>

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just sit around
while an admiral shows up!</font>

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in staying here!</font>

176
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir!</font>

177
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess that dumbass's captain
is an even bigger dumbass!</font>

178
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I ever run into 'em in the
New World... I'll destroy 'em!</font>

179
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I ever run into 'em in the
New World... I'll destroy 'em!</font>

180
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Causing trouble with Navy Headquarters
with the New World right in sight...</font>

181
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a truly troublesome lot they are...</font>

182
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Focus on getting ready to set sail.</font>

183
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir! Right away Captain Drake!</font>

184
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then. Who's going to show up?</font>

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Given the situation I somehow doubt
this is an all-out arrest plot.</font>

186
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Straw Hat Luffy they're after right?</font>

187
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I'd like to see what
an admiral is actually like.</font>

188
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't be serious Apoo-san!
Let's just get out of here!</font>

189
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hawkins! It's dangerous
here! Let's set sail immediately!</font>

190
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down.</font>

191
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am not destined to die today.</font>

192
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Holy Land of Marie Jois"</font>

193
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That brat again?! It's one
thing after the other!</font>

194
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that entire family's bloodline?!</font>

195
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reports indicate the presence
of the Straw Hat crew</font>

196
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eustass Captain Kid and his crew
and Trafalgar Law and his crew.</font>

197
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thirteen people with bounties
have been confirmed!</font>

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of them five are rookies
worth over 100 million each!</font>

199
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally the key offender
appears to be Monkey D. Luffy</font>

200
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who assaulted the Celestial Dragons!</font>

201
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've lost contact with the
guards at the Human Shop--</font>

202
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">oh I mean Employment Office.</font>

203
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe they may have all been subdued...</font>

204
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case this act of taking
three Celestial Dragons hostage</font>

205
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is a vile and unprecedented transgression!</font>

206
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have they made any demands?</font>

207
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No none at the moment...</font>

208
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the case may be Sengoku-san
we'll need to take action</font>

209
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">given that World Nobles are the victims here.</font>

210
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kizaru...</font>

211
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:47,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Allow me to go. Rest easy; I won't be long.</font>

212
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Justice"</font>

Human Auction Shop
Backstage</font>

214
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no laughing matter!</font>

215
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your shop you know!</font>

216
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister Doflamingo...!
Where are you right now?!</font>

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shop has lost all credibility and
then there's Roswald's family too!</font>

218
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're definitely going to lash out at us!</font>

219
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do something to fix things!</font>

220
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously... Human trafficking
is so old-fashioned you idiot.</font>

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all about smiles now! Smiles!</font>

222
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Disco I'm giving the shop to you.</font>

223
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So don't be callin' me anymore!</font>

224
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! You're abandoning us during
the worst crisis we've ever had?!</font>

225
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quiet you annoying bastard!</font>

226
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While you sit there blaming
me for your own misfortune</font>

on the horizon Disco-kun?</font>

230
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,460

233
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,980

are dangerous people!</font>

236
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes most of them! We're
hurrying to set them up!</font>

237
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has HQ said anything?</font>

238
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Admiral Kizaru is coming but
the vanguard will consist of...</font>

239
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of them?! They're coming here?!</font>

240
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir! That's what they said...</font>

241
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on old man! Don't
be crazy! It'll explode!</font>

242
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've seen a slave's collar explode before!</font>

243
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a bad idea! A very bad idea!</font>

244
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be all right. Just stay still.</font>

245
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno what kind of power he used...</font>

246
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's Franky doing?!</font>

247
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you it's too dangerous!
It won't come off without the key!</font>

248
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's ringing! What're we gonna do?!</font>

249
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

250
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's all this now?!
Don't scare me like that!</font>

251
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your collar and handcuffs are already off!</font>

252
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It came off...</font>

253
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Camie!</font>

254

255
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?! I finally manage
to find 'em but then...!</font>

256
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! You found them? Well done!</font>

257
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we no longer need them.
Here you carry this girl.</font>

258
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">U-Umm... Th-Thanks!</font>

259
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What in the hell's going on
here?! Who are you anyway?!</font>

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What did he do?</font>

261
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That geezer did something mysterious again!</font>

262
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just who is that old guy?!</font>

263
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey almost-slaves!</font>

264
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the buyers took off! You
should scram while you can too!</font>

265
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here!</font>

266
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that geezer took out these
guards all at once too</font>

267
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then he must know how to use
magic or some type of sorcery!</font>

268
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's got powers or something!</font>

269
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said something about
your straw hat though...</font>

270
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That straw hat suits dauntless men very well.</font>

271
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been wanting to meet you...</font>

272
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Monkey D. Luffy.</font>

273
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you know him Luffy?!</font>

274
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know him! Really!</font>

275
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think he used what's called "Haki."</font>

276
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know much about it either though...</font>

277
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry about that fellows. I didn't
realize other pirates were watching.</font>

278
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be quite strong to have
withstood that with no problem at all.</font>

279
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never expected to meet
such a big-shot here...</font>

280
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Dark King" Silvers Rayleigh...</font>

281
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt about it. What's a legendary
man doing in a place like this?</font>

282
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On these islands I'm Ray-san
the coating craftsman.</font>

283
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go calling me that other name.</font>

284
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm an old soldier now. I just
want to live in peace and quiet.</font>

285
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I take it you'll survive Hachi?</font>

286
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After I told you all those times
not to walk around these islands...</font>

287
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry...</font>

288
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for saving my friend fellows.</font>

289
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what's this about wanting
to meet me old guy?</font>

290
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes let's save that for later.
We first need to get out of here.</font>

291
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have the place completely
surrounded Boss.</font>

292
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright you criminals! Release
the Roswald family at once!</font>

293
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An admiral will be arriving shortly!
I recommend immediate surrender!</font>

294
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't blame us for whatever
happens you rookies!</font>

295
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not only caught up in this we're
being treated as accomplices now.</font>

296
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got a good glimpse of the insanity
that makes Straw Hat Luffy so notorious.</font>

297
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no complaints but I'd rather not
run into an admiral now if I can avoid it!</font>

298
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh I'd prefer not to use that power of
mine anymore so I leave this to you!</font>

299
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be hard for me to stay settled
down if the navy discovers who I am.</font>

300
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no intention of helping
out a senior citizen!</font>

301
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The longer we stay here the
more troops there'll be!</font>

302
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I'll go on ahead!</font>

303
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While I'm at it I'll help you guys out too!</font>

304
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll clean things up outside so don't worry!</font>

305
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you I'll do it!</font>

306
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

307
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna do it!</font>

308
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get outta here!</font>

309
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up you guys!</font>

310
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to do it.</font>

311
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you talking about?!</font>

312
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you leave it to me!</font>

313
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I'm gonna do it!</font>

314
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me what to do!</font>

315
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys just don't get it!</font>

316
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who doesn't get it!</font>

317
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

318
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can go back inside!</font>

319
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Are you even listening?!
I told you two to stay back!</font>

320
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me what to do again and I'll start
by getting rid of you Eustass-ya!</font>

321
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get ready!</font>

322
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez they're so simpleminded!</font>

323
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! There's gonna an all-out brawl!</font>

324
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's use that chance to escape! We
can't just sit around here anyway!</font>

325
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hatchin...</font>

326
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks... I'm sorry for
causing you trouble...!</font>

327
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind me! I'm just
glad you're all right!</font>

328
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's follow them. We're going
to break through in one go.</font>

329
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right then.</font>

330
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us meet up on Grove #13 should
we find ourselves separated.</font>

331
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grove #13? Got it!</font>

332
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't "got it" at all!</font>

333
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What will you do Mr. Giant?!</font>

334
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were all on the verge of becoming slaves.</font>

335
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to flee somewhere
with these people!</font>

336
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see! Be careful not to
draw attention to yourself!</font>

337
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man! Straw Hat's friends!</font>

338
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will repay this favor if we
ever meet again! Thank you!</font>

339
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks so much!</font>

340
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

341
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure no problem!</font>

342
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're taking credit?!</font>

343
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mortars! Fire!</font>

344
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum-Gum...</font>

345
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Balloon!</font>

346
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Repel!</font>

347
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Room.</font>

348
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What's this circle?!</font>

349
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shambles.</font>

350
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out! All three of 'em have powers!</font>
