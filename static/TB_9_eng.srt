76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then our shadows, right?</font>

77
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's three.</font>

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not how you're supposed to rank them.</font>

79
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, let me explain about Nami and the shadows.</font>

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ma-!</font>

81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marry?!</font>

82
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mess around!</font>

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So damn unforgivable!</font>

84
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He sure is brave to marry Nami.</font>

85
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And also, I'm a giant?!</font>

86
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They made such a zombie?!</font>

87
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, Luffy's and the cook's zombies have been confirmed, Usopp?</font>

88
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought he was one of the Seven Warlords...</font>

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared all of a sudden.</font>

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't know?</font>

91
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

92
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If zombies resemble oneself, then...</font>

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've also seen Zoro's zombie.</font>

94
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he like?</font>

95
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just like you.</font>

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was wearing wooden clogs so, I knew it wasn't you.</font>

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it doesn't matter.</font>

98
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we find those three zombies and throw salt in their mouths, we'll get our shadows back, right?</font>

99
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, good thing you found such a weakness.</font>

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who told us about their weakness and told us to come here and rescue you... was that skeleton.</font>

101
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You met Brook?!</font>

102
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we did.</font>

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I asked him a foolish question shortly afterwards...</font>

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be honest, the first time you said he'd tag along as one of our friends, I completely disagreed.</font>

105
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The more I talked with that clattering skeleton, I realized he really has bones.</font>

106
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although he's a skeleton.</font>

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a real man!</font>

108
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wait a minute!</i></font>

109
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>While we're still at it, just answer me one more question.</i></font>

110
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you go out in public with that look of yours, you know how people will react, right?</i></font>

111
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're a talking skeleton, you know.</i></font>

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>There's no way someone will befriend a guy with such evil looks.</i></font>

113
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hideous things always get despised.</i></font>

114
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Franky, what're you...?</i></font>

115
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even if you manage to escape this cursed sea...</i></font>

116
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're aware of your fate.</i></font>

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Decades of despair, unable to escape...</i></font>

118
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You said you were so lonely you wished to die, right?</i></font>

119
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If I were you, I'd no longer cling to life.</i></font>

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Having such insignificant existence and acting all chivalrous all the time...</i></font>

121
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Just tell us what're you hiding already.</i></font>

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>To go that far... what do you want to achieve?</i></font>

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What is that promise you made to your friends that you talk about?</i></font>

124
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're a very nosy person.</i></font>

125
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's simple.</i></font>

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Long ago, our pirate crew left one of our friends behind at a certain place.</i></font>

127
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It was a very painful farewell, but...</i></font>

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As our ship departed, we promised we'd return no matter what.</i></font>

129
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then, we were annihilated on this sea...</i></font>

130
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>In order to not leave our promise unfulfilled....</i></font>

131
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As the only member of the crew who has lived long enough, I have the duty to inform him of these events.</i></font>

132
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Since the day of our deaths...</i></font>

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>50 years?!</i></font>

135
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey! That was too long ago! I wasn't even born yet!</i></font>

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sorry to say but, there's no way that guy could've waited such a long time!</i></font>

137
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why would he wait for me?</i></font>

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He has the right to leave and not be kept waiting.</i></font>

139
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If by any chance he believed in our promise and has been waiting this whole time...</i></font>

140
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't imagine how lonely he must feel...</i></font>

141
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If he's been waiting this whole time while thinking we betrayed him...</i></font>

142
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't imagine how miserable he must feel!</i></font>

143
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You...</i></font>

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The name of the friend to whom we swore to meet again on that cape is...</i></font>

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Laboon.</i></font>

146
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We couldn't take a little whale on our dangerous journey...</i></font>

147
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Take care, Laboon! {I cant understand this so i kinda randomly timed it.. check it please-campa}</i></font>

148
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We'll definitely come back for you!</i></font>

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I suppose he must've grown a lot by now...</i></font>

150
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Is your friend...</i></font>

151
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A whale...?</i></font>

152
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Correct.</i></font>

153
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't help but think he has believed in us since then.</i></font>

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He might be thinking that we'd play our cheerful music as always...</i></font>

155
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And return for him with open arms.</i></font>

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I cannot ask for forgiveness after we died so irresponsibly.</i></font>

157
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I cannot call him from the afterlife, after our reckless promise...</i></font>

158
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dying is not an excuse...!</i></font>

159
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Because a man once said that they would return no matter what!</i></font>

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how it is.</font>

161
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon...</font>

162
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?!</font>

163
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's him...</font>

164
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've met...</font>

165
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that whale.</font>

166
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know him?</font>

167
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why...?</font>

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Twin Capes located at the entrance of the Grand Line.</font>

170
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's where we met that huge whale.</font>

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It kept bumping it's head against the Red Line, the wall which divides the world.</font>

172
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For 50 years, it waited for its pirate friends who promised to return after doing a lap around the world.</font>

173
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somehow, Luffy stopped its suicidal habit of hitting itself against that wall.</font>

174
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It still lives...</font>

175
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And keeps waiting for its friends at those capes.</font>

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an amazing story...</font>

177
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both of them have kept the promise they made 50 years ago!</font>

178
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, one of the friends Laboon has been waiting for is...</font>

179
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That skeleton.</font>

180
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you became stronger in these past 5 years...!</font>

181
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have as well!</font>

182
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's because our thoughts are the same!</font>

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always, you keep treasuring that afro.</font>

184
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't be able to protect such a huge weak point forever.</font>

185
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

186
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Laboon...</font>

187
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you still remember us?</font>

188
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whenever I think of how you must feel...</font>

189
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes my heart ache...</font>

190
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I don't have a heart now!</font>

191
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were unable to overcome the challenges of the Grand Line.</font>

192
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our friends have all died.</font>

193
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for myself...</font>

194
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only have I lost my friends...</font>

195
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My face, my body... I've lost everything...</font>

196
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we ever meet again...</font>

197
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't recognize me in the skeleton shape I am now...</font>

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

199
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not the afro!</font>

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have nothing left, but...</font>

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At least... I have this head that looks like Laboon which amused everyone!</font>

202
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Are you brothers?</i></font>

203
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll protect it with my life...!</font>

204
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we'll definitely meet again...</font>

205
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait for me...</font>

206
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the promised...</font>

207
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capes...</font>

208
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I love both the skeleton and the whale, damn it!</font>

209
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

210
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I've made up my mind!</font>

211
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a musician...!</font>

212
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A talking skeleton...!</font>

213
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has an afro...!</font>

214
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Yohoho thing...!</font>

215
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's Laboon's friend!</font>

216
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I have to drag him, I'll make him board this ship!</font>

217
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make him our crewmate!</font>

218
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any objections?!</font>

219
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you change your mind even if we had any?</font>

220
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really want him to see Laboon again!</font>

221
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Completely agreed, damn it!</font>

222
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too, you bastards!</font>

223
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm no longer afraid of skeletons!</font>

224
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that we're fully aware of the situation...</font>

225
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll personally go prevent Nami-san from getting married!</font>

226
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro!</font>

227
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you going?</font>

228
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get going already.</font>

229
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta recover an extra shadow now, don't we?</font>

230
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

231
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men, get ready to counterattack!</font>

232
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're pulverizing Thriller Bark!</font>

233
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good luck!</font>

234
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're coming too, idiot!</font>

235
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, it won't be easy to find the zombies that have our shadows.</font>

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also,</font>

237
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's zombie is extremely huge!</font>

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's bigger than two giants!</font>

239
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't hope to beat that thing!</font>

240
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need to search for the zombies.</font>

241
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, I wanna see mine.</font>

242
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you talking about?!</font>

243
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay like this, we'll never get close to the sunlight again.</font>

244
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, don't you remember...?</font>

245
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The old zombie man said it, didn't he?</font>

246
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I just saw you...</i></font>

247
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're terribly strong!</i></font>

248
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So...</i></font>

249
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What request?</i></font>

250
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I want you to beat a certain man...</i></font>

251
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm sure you can do it!</i></font>

252
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Despite the number of victims, if you beat him, everyone will be saved!</i></font>

253
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we take out Gekko Moriah, everyone's shadows will return!</font>

254
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He did say that...</font>

255
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he goes again... right to the point...</font>

256
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then...</font>

257
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we climb those stairs, we'll find Moriah, right?</font>

258
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Certainly!</font>

259
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway...</font>

260
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go kick Gekko Moriah's ass!</font>

261
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since that'll bring everyone's shadows back...</font>

262
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, I'll leave Nami up to you.</font>

263
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But of course!</font>

264
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care whether he is an invisible man or a ceramic man!</font>

265
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll kick the hell out of him right through the other side of this fog!</font>

266
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'd let that wedding take place!</font>

267
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I forgot to mention it, but that invisible man saw Nami completely naked in the bathroom.</font>

268
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaaaat?!</font>

269
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

270
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't keep angering him...</font>

271
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might transform into something.</font>

272
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel guilty for letting Nami get kidnapped right before my eyes.</font>

273
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go with Sanji too!</font>

274
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But mostly it's because I don't wanna come across that Warlord again!</font>

275
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That skeleton's fight worries me.</font>

276
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go there.</font>

277
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw Hat beats Moriah first, that'd solve one problem but...</font>

278
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until that happens, getting killed by his own shadow is a serious matter.</font>

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll accompany you there, Franky.</font>

280
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm curious about how strong this so called "Legendary Samurai" zombie is.</font>

281
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-chan and Skeleton-san...</font>

282
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the time being they're our priority.</font>

283
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that, defeating Moriah is definitely the key to victory.</font>

284
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not as simple as you say.</font>

285
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our enemy is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>

286
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem.</font>

287
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crocodile was too.</font>

288
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem?!</font>

289
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were nearly killed!</font>

290
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you, be careful!</font>

291
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Especially since... I know I already said it, but your zombie is terribly huge!</font>

292
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, alright.</font>

293
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, take this.</font>

294
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry one bag at least.</font>

295
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my Special Zombie-Purifying Salt Ball.</font>

296
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, so this is what you were making a while ago.</font>

297
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pretty clever.</font>

298
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway...</font>

299
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a word of advice for you all.</font>

300
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how thick the fog is within this sea...</font>

301
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no guarantee sunlight won't get through it!</font>

302
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're only safe because it's midnight!</font>

303
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, when the sun arises at daybreak, that's our ultimate time limit!</font>

304
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That goes without saying!</font>

305
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reaching daybreak without tasting food is the worst!</font>

306
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll make you regret having messed with us!</font>

307
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah!</font>

308
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll take twice the food that was stolen...!</font>

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before daybreak!</font>

310
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you see... that's not it...</font>

311
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean the limit to recover our shad-</font>

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Let's go!</font>

313
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

314
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-swan!</font>

315
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Wait a-</font>

316
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Do as you wish then!</font>

317
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming to rescue you!</font>

318
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

319
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is a ship!</font>

320
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea looks awful...</font>

321
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But my future looks great!</font>

322
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'll become the Pirate King with this ship!</font>

323
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Oars right now?</font>

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He climbed to the top of the mast, Master.</font>

325
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... but... Master!</font>

326
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:21,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just sit around doing nothing while such a huge zombie wanders aimlessly around the island!</font>

327
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy is terribly dangerous!</font>

328
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.</font>

329
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a matter of time.</font>

330
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that we have Oars, we'll be able to steal the shadows of much stronger warriors.</font>

331
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From now on, we'll have Special Zombies coming one after another!</font>

332
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll need stronger marionettes it seems, Hogback.</font>

333
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!</font>

334
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hogback-sama!</font>

335
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in trouble!</font>

336
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirates...!</font>

337
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Hildon?</font>

338
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three whose shadows were stolen woke up at the ship and are heading this way with their friends!</font>

339
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

340
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who get their shadows stolen can't wake up that quick!</font>

341
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Their friends found a way to wake them!</font>

342
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems they have some connection with the Humming One!</font>

343
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps, that man told them what he knew!</font>

344
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the pirates knowing how to purify the zombies is proof!</font>

345
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What'd you say?!</font>

346
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies fear the pirates...</font>

347
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Currently, they're running from place to place...</font>

348
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Wild Zombies, Surprise Zombies and Soldier Zombies, couldn't lay a hand on them...</font>

349
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even before the pirates knew about the salt!</font>

350
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deploy the General Zombies!</font>

351
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll take care of the pirates as long as they don't swallow salt!</font>

352
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what the hell is Absalom doing?!</font>

353
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... you see...</font>

354
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His wedding is about to start right now...</font>

355
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most of the general zombies are in attendance.</font>

356
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those fools doing?!</font>

357
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, he asked if Hogback-sama could give one of his belly dances at the reception in 1 hour.</font>

358
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right...</font>

359
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wedding ceremony is a once in a lifetime memorial event.</font>

360
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd be one funny dance-</font>

361
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'd do that now!</font>

362
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cancel that wedding this instant!</font>

363
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a simple zombie...</font>

364
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't go against Absalom-sama...</font>

365
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No need to rely on that beast.</font>

366
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If my ghosts weaken them, the Soldier Zombies will be more than enough to capture them.</font>

367
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't panic just because they know the zombies' weakness.</font>

368
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll capture every single one of them, so...</font>

369
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare some marionettes for the shadows of the remaining pirates.</font>

370
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going back to my room.</font>

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Kumashi.</font>

372
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right away...</font>

373
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true.</font>

374
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How reliable.</font>

375
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I expect no less from the Ghost Princess.</font>

376
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

377
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be best if you learned...</font>

378
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From Kumashi's example.</font>

379
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway...</font>

380
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything will be fine, Moriah-sama.</font>

381
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so?</font>

382
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How boring...</font>

383
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again...?</font>

384
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, you won't have to do anything.</font>

385
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stay here a bit longer.</font>

386
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars amuses me more right now.</font>

387
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I have a request.</font>

388
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since Absalom isn't doing anything, I'd like to take command of just two zombies if it's possible.</font>

389
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're here!</font>

390
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Moriah?!</font>

391
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Here they come!</font>

392
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get outta my way!</font>

393
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back the food!</font>

394
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's the damn bastard who peeked while Nami-san was in the shower?!</font>

395
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show yourself!</font>

396
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems we won't be needing salt for now...</font>

397
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're rampaging with absolute fury.</font>

398
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if they even care about the shadows...</font>

399
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Commander! There are five people heading for the Dance Hall!</font>

400
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we can't handle the two on the bridge below!</font>

401
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="35">Moriah's Dance Hall</font></font>

402
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="35">Perona's Room</font></font>

403
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="35">Wonder Garden</font></font>

404
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="35">{\an6}Heading to
Moriah's
Dance Hall</font></font>

405
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="35">{\an6}Heading to
Perona's
Room</font></font>

406
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It angers me just thinking about me being caught by these weaklings!</font>

407
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're so grateful that I freed you, you can start calling me "big bro" if you want.</font>

408
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Like hell!</font>

409
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! This is bad!</font>

410
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? What's wrong?</font>

411
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over...</font>

412
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to be reborn, I would want to be a maggot...</font>

413
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have such large eyebrows... I'm better off dead...</font>

414
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Luffy, Sanji!</font>

415
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you?!</font>

416
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin, what's going on?</font>

417
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the ghosts doing!</font>

418
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you touch them, you lose your will to live.</font>

419
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We haven't found a countermeasure to it...</font>

420
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I got you now!</font>

421
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lead Star!</font>

422
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

423
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they get us too, it'll be over!</font>

424
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ghosts have almost caught up with us!</font>

425
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! If we all get caught, it's over!</font>

426
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Set sail! Set sail!</font>

427
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're falling!</font>

428
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

429
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

430
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That just now...</font>

431
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way, that's impossible...</font>

432
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That surprised me.</font>

433
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stairs are gone!</font>

434
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-What's wrong?!</font>

435
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What happened?</font>

436
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies, Usopp and Sanji...</font>

437
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone fell down.</font>

438
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leaving aside the fact that these two fell down...</font>

439
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the meaning of this?</font>

440
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our path was suddenly blocked.</font>

441
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that wall?</font>

442
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it...!</font>

443
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell happened...?</font>

444
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now...?</font>

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It isn't stone.</font>

446
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons Left!</font>

447
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

448
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!</font>

449
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A huge wall suddenly appeared.</font>

450
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! That's no wall!</font>

451
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Luffy's zombie!</font>

452
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>
