00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's right. Not unless we get you out of here now.</i></font>

265
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We never thought that we could die.</i></font>

266
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We wanted him to help us because we wanted to go home!</i></font>

267
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We were afraid he might break his promise and keep us for another year because of the unknown disease!</i></font>

268

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I know! You've done nothing wrong!</i></font>

275
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's why we're gonna get Caesar, no matter what!</i></font>

276
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,030

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I won't let you die!</i></font>

282
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I swear I'll save you!</i></font>

283

288
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So listen up... Mocha, right?</i></font>

289
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We can't let the other kids have the candy, ever again.</i></font>

290
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm going to stay here and do my best to give them the sedative.</i></font>

291
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So Mocha, will you go to the Biscuits Room and protect the candy there?</i></font>

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

293
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I understand! I'll never let them eat the candy again!</i></font>

294
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're all going to go home together!</i></font>

295
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Exactly!</i></font>

296
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha just coughed up blood!</font>

297
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd the delicious candy make her do that?</font>

298
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe this!</font>

299
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The children have stopped.</font>

300
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? This is because you were so selfish!</font>

301
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

302
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what the candy does to you!</font>

303
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha wanted to save you!</font>

304
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it meant... sacrificing herself!</font>

305
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, this might be our only chance to calm them down!</font>

306
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I have to treat Mocha first!</font>

307
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time.</font>

308
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The kids are standing still!</font>

309
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

310
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No violence, alright guys?!</font>

311
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

312
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fight numbers with numbers!</font>

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold them down!</font>

314
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Alright!</i></font>

315
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun?!</font>

316
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy?!</font>

317
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro! Does kicking them in the balls count as violence?</font>

318
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a little over the line.</font>

319
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger that!</font>

320
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Medical team, up front!</font>

321
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yes, Sir!</i></font>

322
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, let these guys help you!</font>

323
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can handle an injection or two, at least!</font>

324
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

325
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, you're gonna hafta calm down now!</font>

326
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Forward!</i></font>

327
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty sure the examination room is around here somewhere.</font>

328
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry her there!</font>

329
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She doesn't have long. You know that, right, Racoon Dog?</font>

330
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know!</font>

331
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha...</font>

332
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, this is my fault!</font>

333
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper-chan...</font>

334
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha, are you alright?</font>

335
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

336
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't give them the candy!</font>

337
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! You protected your friends!</font>

338
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

339
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

340
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to you, everyone can go home!</font>

341
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha, I promise I'll save you too!</font>

342
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I swear...</font>

343
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you <i>will</i> grow up!</font>

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

347
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

348
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is Caesar?</font>

349
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He's right down this corridor, in Building R!</font>

350
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

351
