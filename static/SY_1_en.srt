<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's not bad! He's great! Right?!</font>

258
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! He's great!</font>

259
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How does that work?</font>

260
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kaya, the girl who lives here, is sick.</font>

261
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">A ship was stopped by the goldfish,</font>

262
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">and on it was a pirate bigger
than even a mountain!</font>

263
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And she's been depressed ever since
her parents died from an illness a year ago.</font>

264
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">His face was hilarious!</font>

265
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even though she has lots
of money, she's so sad.</font>

266
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So our captain tells his special
made-up stories to make her laugh!</font>

267
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">'Cause our captain's
the best at telling lies!</font>

268
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Never heard of a pirate with
a face like that, have you?</font>

269
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, he's a good guy!</font>

270
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah!</font>

271
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I like the captain
because he's a meddler!</font>

272
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I like how bossy he is!</font>

273
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I like how boastful he is!</font>

274
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And that's helped her feel better?</font>

275
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, a lot better!</font>

276
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Great!</font>

277
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's go ask her for a ship then!</font>

278
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just getting in is impossible!</font>

279
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There are strong guards at the gate!</font>

280
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Huh?
– Huh?</font>

281
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where'd Luffy go?</font>

282
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll go ask!</font>

283
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wait, you're not gonna...?!</font>

284
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum...</font>

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">His arms stretched!</font>

286
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's a monster!</font>

287
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pardon...</font>

288
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Hey!</font>

289
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the Intrusion!</font>

290
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?</font>

291
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yahoo!</font>

292
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That worked great!</font>

293
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It did not!</font>

294
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A-Are you all right?!</font>

295
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! It's okay, it's okay!</font>

296
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They're new recruits who heard
all about me and came from afar...</font>

297
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">to join the Usopp Pirates!</font>

298
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm? No we didn't.</font>

299
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're here to ask a favor!</font>

300
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A favor? Of me?</font>

301
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! We want a big ship–</font>

302
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">You, there!</font>

303
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you doing?!</font>

304
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore...</font>

305
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't appreciate you all...</font>

306
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">breaking in here without permission!</font>

307
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A-Actually, Klahadore,
these people are–</font>

308
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That can wait for now.</font>

309
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can hear all about your reasons later.</font>

310
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now leave, all of you!</font>

311
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Or do you have something to say?</font>

312
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well, actually, we want a ship!</font>

313
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No!</font>

314
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

315
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Crap!</font>

316
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've heard all about you.</font>

317
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're well-known in the village.</font>

318
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Quite impressive for your age.</font>

319
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can call me Captain Usopp, too!</font>

320
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Since you admire me <i>so</i> much!</font>

321
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've heard all about
your father, as well.</font>

322
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

323
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore! Stop!</font>

324
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're nothing but
the son of a filthy pirate!</font>

325
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nothing you do will surprise me,</font>

326
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but I ask that you stay away
from the lady of this house!</font>

327
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">F-Filthy?!</font>

328
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You and the lady are from
completely different worlds!</font>

329
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is it money you're after?
How much do you want?</font>

330
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's enough, Klahadore!
Apologize to Usopp!</font>

331
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, now! Be careful, Kaya!</font>

332
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What reason is there to apologize
to this savage man, my lady?</font>

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I am merely stating the truth.</font>

334
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I feel for you.</font>

335
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You must truly hate
your idiot of a father</font>

336
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">for abandoning his family and village
because of his lust for treasure!</font>

337
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore!</font>

338
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't you dare insult
my father any more!</font>

339
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

340
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you getting
all worked up for?</font>

341
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why not simply tell another
one of your outrageous lies?</font>

342
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Perhaps how your father is really
a traveling salesman,</font>

343
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">or maybe that he's not
even your real father...</font>

344
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shut up!</font>

345
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

346
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">S-See! You immediately
resort to violence!</font>

347
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Like father, like son!</font>

348
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shut up!</font>

349
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm proud that my father is a pirate!</font>

350
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm proud that he's
a brave warrior of the sea!</font>

351
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're right, I <i>am</i> a liar!</font>

352
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But I'll <i>never</i> lie about
proudly being related to a pirate!</font>

353
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm the son of a pirate!</font>

354
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain...</font>

355
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A pirate, a brave warrior of the sea?</font>

356
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's quite a twisted way
of putting things...</font>

357
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But <i>you're</i> the undeniable
proof of his savage blood!</font>

358
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You run around spouting lies,</font>

359
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and act violently
whenever you're angry!</font>

360
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And to top it off,</font>

361
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you cozy up to the lady of this house
so you can get her fortune!</font>

362
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?! I only–</font>

363
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The fact your father is a pirate</font>

364
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">is more than enough proof
that you'd hatch such a scheme!</font>

365
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it, you still won't let up?!</font>

366
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop, Usopp!</font>

367
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please, no more violence!</font>

368
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore isn't a bad person!</font>

369
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's just...</font>

370
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's just trying too hard
to do what's best for me!</font>

371
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Leave this place!</font>

372
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Never come near this mansion again!</font>

373
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, I get it.</font>

374
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't need you to tell me!</font>

375
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll never come back here again!</font>

376
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp...</font>

377
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You stupid <i>butt</i>-ler jerk!</font>

378
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Our captain's not that kind of guy!</font>

379
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! You stupid-head!</font>

380
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stupid-head!</font>

381
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stupid-head!</font>

382
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why're you saying it too?</font>

383
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– What's your problem?!
– Hey, now! Stop!</font>

384
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Come fight me, if you can!</font>

385
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You will all leave at once, too!</font>

386
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your meal, my lady.</font>

387
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No thanks.</font>

388
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't want it.</font>

389
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The cook would be sad
to hear you say that.</font>

390
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He works his hardest to come up with
meals that suit your needs.</font>

391
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why did you talk like that?</font>

392
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I know I was wrong to talk with
Usopp without telling you.</font>

393
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But you didn't need to
kick him out like that.</font>

394
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">May I sit?</font>

395
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go ahead.</font>

396
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's been nearly three years...</font>

397
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">since the day I came to this mansion.</font>

398
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll never forget what
happened that day...</font>

399
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was kicked off the ship I worked on</font>

400
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">because of a mistake I made.</font>

401
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And with no work or money,</font>

402
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was on the verge
of dying like a beggar.</font>

403
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In my eyes, I owe my life
to your late parents...</font>

404
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And to you, their daughter.</font>

405
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:31,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I realize that it isn't my place
to interfere with your friendships.</font>

406
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But that Usopp kid isn't exactly
known for his upstanding character!</font>

407
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:42,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If... if anything should happen to you,</font>

408
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I would never be able to ask for
forgiveness from your kind parents!</font>

409
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you think ill of me
for what I did earlier?</font>

410
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, not at all!</font>

411
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm glad to have you too, Klahadore!</font>

412
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But please don't misunderstand.</font>

413
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp is a very nice person.</font>

414
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">However, whether he's
nice or not is irrelevant!</font>

415
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore! You blockhead!</font>

416
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, "blockhead" will do just fine!</font>

417
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where'd Luffy go?</font>

418
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who knows. Probably ran
after the "captain."</font>

419
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Our captain would be at his spot!</font>

420
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, the shore!</font>

421
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He always goes there
when something happens!</font>

422
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well never mind that,
isn't one of you missing?</font>

423
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yeah, Tamanegi!
– Yeah, Tamanegi!</font>

424
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He always disappears!</font>

425
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! And then he
shows up all freaked out!</font>

426
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bad news!</font>

427
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">See?</font>

428
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A backwards guy!</font>

429
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A weird guy is walking
backwards this way!</font>

430
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Liar!
– Liar!</font>

431
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the truth!</font>

432
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just look!</font>

433
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Who's calling me weird?!</font>

434
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,930
<font face="Roboto" size="44"><b><font size="40">Jango
<font size="35">Hypnotist</font></font></b></font>

435
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm not weird.</font>

436
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You seem pretty weird to me.</font>

437
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be stupid!</font>

438
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm just an ordinary, passing hypnotist!</font>

439
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hypnotist?! Awesome!</font>

440
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Show us something!</font>

441
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! Do a trick!</font>

442
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

443
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be dumb!</font>

444
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why should I have to reveal</font>

445
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">my techniques to
a bunch of strangers?!</font>

446
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright.</font>

447
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Watch this ring closely.</font>

448
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So, you <i>are</i> going to?!</font>

449
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You'll fall asleep at the count
of "one, two, Jango."</font>

450
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright, here we go!</font>

451
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One.</font>

452
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Two.</font>

453
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Jango!</font>

454
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! What's with this guy?!</font>

455
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yo!</font>

456
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here you are!</font>

457
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, it's you! Don't just
sneak up like that!</font>

458
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So what? Do you want something?!</font>

459
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah. Your dad's Yasopp, right?</font>

460
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oww...</font>

461
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, Yasopp is my old man...</font>

462
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But how do you know that?</font>

463
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No matter what anyone says,
Yasopp is a great pirate!</font>

464
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Awesome!</i></font>

465
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>That's nothing. I could even shoot
an ant right between the eyes!</i></font>

466
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Y'know, Luffy,</i></font>

467
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I got a kid named Usopp,
who's just about your age!</i></font>

468
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I know! You've already
told me lots of times!</i></font>

469
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>What?!</i></font>

470
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Well, I'm gonna tell you some more!</i></font>

471
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>It was sad to say goodbye,
but there was no other choice!</i></font>

472
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>There was but one reason:
the pirate flag was calling me!</i></font>

473
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Stuck! Stuck!</i></font>

474
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Really?!</font>

475
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My old man's on such
an awesome ship?!</font>

476
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I dunno about now,
but I bet he's still with him.</font>

477
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">After all, your dad <i>is</i>
a great sharpshooter!</font>

478
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In this day and age
where pirates are everywhere,</font>

479
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm proud of my old man
for risking his life out at sea!</font>

480
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yet, that bastard stomped
all over his name!</font>

481
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He'll pay for this!</font>

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I hate that guy too.</font>

483
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So you're not gonna go
see that girl anymore?</font>

484
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yeah, I dunno...</font>

485
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If that butler comes and apologizes
to me, I might consider it.</font>

486
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>That</i> butler?</font>

487
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, <i>that</i> butler...</font>

488
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's that butler doing out <i>here</i>?!</font>

489
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Let go!</font>

490
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Jango.</font>

491
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I told you to avoid doing
anything to make you stand out.</font>

492
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yet there you are sleeping
in the middle of the village...</font>

493
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be stupid.</font>

494
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't stand out one bit.</font>

495
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm not weird, either.</font>

496
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's someone else with him.
Some weird guy...</font>

497
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Never seen him before. Who is he?</font>

498
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So, preparations for the plan
are ready, I hope?</font>

499
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Of course.</font>

500
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We can start anytime...</font>

501
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Mistress Assassination Plan!</font>

502
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A-Assassination?!</font>
