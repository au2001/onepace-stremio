00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  Master!</font>

2
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,860
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Ruins of Laboratory #1 and #2</b></font>

3
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got all this stuff sticking outta me!</font>

4
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a furball!</font>

5
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Guard Point!</font>

6
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just by visualizing them,
you can freely transform between six different forms.</font>

7
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This body ain't very stable!</font>

8
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It takes practice!</font>

9
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Don't play on me!</font>

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?!  The samurai left?!</font>

11
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

12
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  I thought that it's been too quiet!</font>

13
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just a short while ago, I told him about a fellow I met who's nothing but a torso.</font>

14
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted to know where I had met him...</font>

15
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I told him that we parted ways near the lake.</font>

16
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then he ran out of here.</font>

17
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was distracted by Nami-san's glorious body
so I let my guard down!</font>

18
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though it's inconvenient for you?</font>

19
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who took him outside
when he was just a head who couldn't move...</font>

20
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was me.</font>

21
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might have been uncalled for, but it was what I had to do.</font>

22
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he gets killed now, it'll be my fault.</font>

23
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

24
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he's a samurai, he doesn't have a torso to hold a sword so all he can do is run away from battle.</font>

25
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, shall we go and do what we must?</font>

26
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That goddamn asshole.</font>

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  I'm gonna head out for a bit, okay?</font>

28
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, sure.</font>

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'll show you the way...</font>

30
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so may I see your panties?</font>

31
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For sure!</font>

32
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right!  We need a camera for an opportunity like this!</font>

33
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop right there!</font>

34
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, you're going too.</font>

35
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

36
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Zoro is there,
Sanji-kun will be in fight-mode at all times!</font>

37
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do I need to search for that farting samurai just because you're an idiot?!  You pervert!</font>

38
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one wants you here, anyway!</font>

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe I'm stuck with a dumbass
who I can't even share this happiness with!</font>

40
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was mercilessly struck.
Do you think my bones were broken?</font>

41
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, all that's broken is my dream to see those panties.</font>

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pervert!</font>

44
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what should we do about your bodies?</font>

45
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The most important thing to do now
is get our bodies back.</font>

46
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to be this pervert for another millisecond!</font>

47
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you trying to kill me with praise?</font>

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't make that face with Chopper's body.</font>

49
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever.</font>

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The real problem is those damn kids. They're a real pain in the ass.</font>

51
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't speak with that face.</font>

52
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever.</font>

53
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

54
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not what I want!</font>

55
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Raccoon Dog-chan, how does it look?</font>

56
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll know in a moment.</font>

57
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh!  That means...</font>

58
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?  Sind?  Are you hurt?</font>

59
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?</font>

60
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

61
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts...</font>

62
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper.  He says it hurts.</font>

63
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cure him.</font>

64
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha!</font>

65
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening to all of you?</font>

66
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doran, too?</font>

67
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the big kids are collapsing!</font>

68
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, what is it?  Are the kids really sick?</font>

70
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

71
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sind, is there anything that you want right now?</font>

72
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you usually do at times like this?</font>

73
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usually?</font>

74
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After the examination... then...</font>

75
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what?</font>

76
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then they give us candy.</font>

77
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy?</font>

78
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's delicious.</font>

79
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone loves the candy.</font>

80
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's really great.</font>

81
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all fizzy and smoke comes out.</font>

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right... We eat it...</font>

83
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And when you eat it...</font>

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you get this happy feeling.</font>

85
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might make me feel better.</font>

86
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard, was it?</font>

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you know about this?</font>

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These kids aren't sick!</font>

89
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?  I patrol outside,
so I don't know what goes on in the laboratory...</font>

90
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but those kids have a serious disease!</font>

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, kids.</font>

92
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chopper.</font>

93
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the little ones look like they're starting to hurt.</font>

94
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ever-compassionate Master
went out of his way to gather those kids,</font>

95
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he's been donating his medical knowledge
to treat them.</font>

96
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a tenderhearted scientist!</font>

97
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts...</font>

98
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ally?</font>

99
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, there's your proof!</font>

100
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After missing a single day of treatment,
those kids have already started to collapse from pain.</font>

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

102
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, what have you learned?</font>

103
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">NHC-10.  That's what I found in the kids' bodies.</font>

104
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There were only faint traces, but it's...</font>

105
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a narcotic!</font>

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A narcotic?!</font>

107
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throughout the world, only a few scientists in select countries are allowed to have it.</font>

108
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know about it because Doctorine used it.</font>

109
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are some legitimate uses for the drug,
but only in the smallest amounts.</font>

110
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's extremely addictive if you take too much.</font>

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The children have been taking the drug every day for a long time now.</font>

112
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've become chronically addicted to it.</font>

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their bodies crave the next dose in order to stop the pain.</font>

114
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!  Why would they have this in their system?!</font>

115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so that they can't run away from the lab, isn't it?!</font>

116
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this "god of salvation" of yours really doing to these kids?!</font>

117
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you speak ill of Master, you'll pay for it!</font>

118
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, what do we do?
They're all collapsing, one after another!</font>

119
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!  Candy!</font>

120
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need candy?
Should I go get some from the building?</font>

121
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

122
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must never eat the candy again!</font>

123
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've been using it to give the drug to the children
without them knowing it!</font>

124
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strawhat man.</font>

125
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll bring me the candy?</font>

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't.  If Chopper says you can't have it,
then you can't have it.</font>

127
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our doctor.  Trust him!</font>

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?  Why?</font>

130
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sind, what happened?</font>

131
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared.</font>

132
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You <i>said</i> that you'd bring me some!</font>

133
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Didn't you!?  Didn't you say that you'd bring me some!</i></font>

134
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What strength!</font>

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Sind!</font>

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen Sind like this before.</font>

137
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What strength!</font>

138
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giants are pretty strong, I guess their children are too.</font>

139
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This</i> strong?</font>

140
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why won't you give me the candy?!</font>

141
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sind's not a giant!</font>

142
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were all normal size when we came to this island.</font>

143
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought the disease was making us get bigger.</font>

144
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing else is wrong with us.</font>

145
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no disease
that makes normal humans grow into giants.</font>

146
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giants are always giant.</font>

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The longer a kid has been here, the bigger they become.</font>

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means...</font>

149
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">their pituitary glands have started producing an abnormal amount of growth hormone.</font>

150
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

151
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These kids...</font>

152
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are being experimented on!</font>

153
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

154
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold yourself together, Ally!</font>

155
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want candy!</font>

156
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was this "Master" thinking,</font>

157
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">using narcotics on such young kids?!</font>

158
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!</font>

159
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other kids are starting to go wild!</font>

160
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy!  Candy!  Candy!</font>

161
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing we can do.</font>

162
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

163
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sind!  Quit it!</font>

164
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should I fight 'em?</font>

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!  Outta the way, Luffy!</font>

166
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!  Don't hurt them!</font>

167
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!  Of course I know that!</font>

168
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew that they must have been kidnapped.</font>

169
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let us out of here!</i></font>

170
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I wanna see Mommy and Daddy!</i></font>

171
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy.</font>

172
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's tragic.  They don't even know that they've been manipulated.</font>

173
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They want to go home!
They want to be with their parents!</font>

174
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to help them!</font>

175
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, I want to save them too.</font>

176
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, I guess we'll take 'em all home.</font>

177
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid, it's not that easy.
There's a mountain of problems!</font>

178
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  Besides, this is all just our interpretation.</font>

179
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unless we ask the ringleader directly, we won't know any of this for sure.</font>

180
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it that Master guy?</font>

181
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Zoro, Sanji, and Brook
went to go look for that samurai.</font>

182
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Well, whatever.</font>

183
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!  Let's go back to the laboratory...</font>

184
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to find Master.</font>

185
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should stay here.</font>

186
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can never forgive Master...</font>

187
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I want to kick his ass...</font>

188
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I'm worried about the children.</font>

189
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to look after them.</font>

190
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ye-Yeah!  That's right!  I'll also have to stay!</font>

191
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Nami!  That's a dirty trick!  You're just scared!</font>

192
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it'll be pretty bad if the kids get violent again.</font>

193
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll tie the big ones up like this.</font>

194
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like it, but...</font>

195
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no helping it.
They're heavyweights when they get violent.</font>

196
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we don't know when they'll wake up.</font>

197
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, who's going to go where?</font>

198
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The four of us have to get together and meet Trafalgar,</font>

199
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or we won't get our bodies back.</font>

200
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's fine the way it is!</font>

201
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is definitely not fine!  Take it seriously!</i></font>

202
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heart of Smoker, Vice Admiral of Navy Unit G-5.</font>

203
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a thoughtful present, Law.</font>

204
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no doubt who won that battle.</font>

205
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll want to report what happened, and since
they lost their ship they'll come to take one of ours.</font>

206
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, I've already made arrangements.</font>

207
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about Straw-Hatter?</font>

208
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not a problem either.</font>

209
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His crew is being dealt with,
and the children will be brought back.</font>

210
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:23,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, the kids will eventually want to come back
even if they're left alone.</font>

211
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monet says that we should take appropriate caution when dealing with the Straw Hat Pirates.</font>

212
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I chose to send the duo after them.</font>

213
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two who <i>never</i> miss their mark.</font>

214
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hit men of the mountain.</font>

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Yeti Cool Brothers.</font>

216
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only six left.</font>

217
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought they'd give us more trouble...</font>

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it's probably best if we finish it quickly.</font>

219
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like these three...</font>

220
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coolly.</font>

221
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me.  Right off the top,
we took care of three of them.</font>

222
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate Hunter Zoro.</font>

223
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Cat Burglar.</font>

224
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Soul King.</font>

225
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll find the corpses
at the bottom of a cliff in zone F-16.</font>

226
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll leave the disposal to you.</font>

227
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You killed them?</font>

228
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that why we're here?</font>

229
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... I guess it's...</font>

230
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't want people to die, <i>then don't call us!</i></font>

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sorry!  Master said either way was...</font>

232
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey.  Don't get hot under the collar.</font>

233
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woops, I slipped.</font>

234
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, coolly.</font>

235
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please continue with the contract.</font>

236
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,920
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Caesar Clown's Laboratory</b></font>

237
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you hear that?  They're already dead, Monet.</font>

238
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

239
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How unexpected.</font>

240
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates are members of
the Worst Generation, the same as Law.</font>

241
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The government is keeping just as close an eye
on them as they are on Blackbeard.</font>

242
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The newspapers made grand claims
that they had completely recovered,</font>

243
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I thought they'd be more impressive.</font>

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you agree, Law?</font>

245
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know them, don't you?</font>

246
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two years ago at Sabaody, and again at Marineford...</font>

247
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gotten involved with Straw Hat twice.</font>

248
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

249
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does this mean that you called them here?</font>

250
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't I already tell you this?</font>

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until we crossed paths at the entrance,
I had no idea that you'd locked them in the laboratory.</font>

252
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I had known, I would have warned you.</font>

253
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down
just because you've locked them in a room.</font>

254
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of your naivety,
I wasn't able to bluff the Navy into going away.</font>

255
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want what's going on here to leak out
any more than you do.</font>

256
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Master!</i></font>

257
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,370

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?</i></font>

260
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're going to stay on Punk Hazard?</i></font>

261
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It took a lot of effort for me to get to this island

262
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I did it because there was
a hidden Government facility here.</i></font>

263
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's your objective?</i></font>

264
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Since Dr. Vegapunk formerly used this lab,</i></font>

I imagine you'd have been more clever about it.</font>

281
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You went through all of the effort of ingratiating yourself to the Government and becoming a Warlord,</font>

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,030

283
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry.</font>

284
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,780

287
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every day I give them a drug-laced candy.</font>

288
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's sweet and fizzy to the taste...</font>

289
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and releases an intoxicating gas into the mouth.</font>

290
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all addicted to it.</font>

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't have them going back home, after all.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're twisted, alright.
Reminds me of a certain someone.</font>

293

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you going to join the battle with the Navy?</font>

294
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you need me, call me.</font>

295
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cut the head off of anyone you need.</font>

296
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hard to handle people who are so sharp.</font>

297
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is again!  What is going on?!</font>

298
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't an earthquake.</font>

299
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we under attack?  It's an enemy!</font>

300
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was that an explosion?</font>

301
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's in the direction we came from.</font>

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it have something to do
with whoever made this footprint?</font>

303
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something out there, alright.</font>

304
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They feel like monsters.  Two of 'em!</font>

305
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go back!  Nami and Chopper are in trouble!</font>

306

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yeah!</font>

307
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!  If this place collapses, the children will...</font>

308
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  Come back here!</font>

309
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll never make it in time!
The two of us have to deal with this!</font>

310
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you see them, Chopper?</font>

311
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many enemies are there?  What are they like?</font>

312
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's...</font>

313
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">nobody out here at all!</font>

314
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way.</font>

315
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow, ow...</font>

316
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I fell asleep.</font>

317
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's getting noisy out there.
Is somebody here to save me?</font>

318
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law?  Master?</font>

319
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, this is the snow mountain...</font>

320
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so it's got to be them!</font>

321
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brownie!  You know something.</font>

322
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's coming?</font>

323
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd better answer, or else I'll do <i>this!</i></font>

324
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!</font>

325
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!</font>

326
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!</font>

327
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!</font>

328
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beam!  Beam!  Beam!  Beam!</font>

329
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're disrespecting the beam!</font>

330
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Searching for them is pointless. They never show themselves.</font>

331
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even we don't know what their faces look like.</font>

332
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But once you hire them
and give them their money, they always get the kill.</font>

333
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we know about them is that their feet are huge,
but their voices are quiet.</font>

334
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and another thing we know is that
they are giant beast-men covered in fur!</font>

335
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the hit man duo
who appear in blizzards on the mountain.</font>

336
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, we also know their names, Rock and Scotch.</font>

337
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People call them...</font>

338
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Yeti Cool Brothers!</font>

339

341
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But nobody knows what they look like.</font>

342
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're both gigantic and powerful!</font>

343
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've come to save me.</font>

344
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're already on their hit list.</font>

345
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard?</font>

346
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're on the hit list as well.</font>

347
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this guy?!</font>

348
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's huge, but I didn't hear him at all!</font>

349
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha?!  Are you Rock?</font>

350
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Scotch.</font>

351
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you said something ridiculous.</font>

352
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must have misheard you.</font>

353
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I nearly had a heart attack.</font>

354
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master must have contracted you to save me?</font>

355
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So hurry up and free me from these chains,
then kill the Straw Hat-</font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc"></font>

356
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't mishear me.  Master put a hit on you.</font>

357
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way!</font>

358
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to this.</font>

359
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and that guy... What was his name again?</font>

360
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice!</font>

361
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went and got himself captured.</font>

362
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That stupid hairy-faced man...
He was famous for being an idiot.</font>

363
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ohhh right, Brownbeard.</font>

364
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh, Master?!</font>

365
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's him?</font>

366
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's an idiot so he's easy to use,
but he has become a burden.</font>

367
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need him anymore.</font>

368
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill him.</font>

369
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look!  There's smoke!</font>

370
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!  Chopper!  Are you okay?!</font>

371
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Brownbeard, aren't you?</font>

372
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You did well to make it this far.</i></font>

373
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're all better now.  You can relax.</i></font>

374
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Good work.</i></font>

375
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Master!  Today was quiet, as normal!</i></font>

376
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I see.  Brownbeard, you are a most reliable guard.</i></font>

377
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Oh, not at all.</i></font>

378
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it.</font>

379
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I don't believe it!</i></font>

381
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Master!</i></font>

382
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so hot-headed.  Die coolly.</font>

383
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Scotch.</font>

384
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another one!</font>

385
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit shooting.
You'll bring this place down and kill the kids.</font>

386
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh.  That wouldn't be cool.</font>

387
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard!</font>

388
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How terrible!  Their own ally!</font>

389
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look there, the captain has come back.</font>

390
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Taking them out comes first.</font>

391
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  They're huge!</font>

392
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giants?</font>

393
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they look a little bit different.</font>

394
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better not have hurt my crew!</font>

395
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha... He's gone!</font>

396
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

397
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?!</font>

398
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry!  They got Nami!</font>

399
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the only one
that we're supposed to capture alive.</font>

400
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A robot with Vegapunk's laser, huh?</font>

401
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we can kill everyone else.</font>

402
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.  Let's enjoy the hunt as much as possible.</font>

403
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coolly.</font>

404
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,420
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Laboratory - Backdoor</b></font>

405
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

406
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law-san, where are you headed?</font>

407
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just ran into the Navy not too far from here!</font>

408
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care.</font>

409
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where I go... is my business.</font>
