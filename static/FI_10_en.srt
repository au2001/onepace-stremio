00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... didn't want to do it either!</font>

63
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,150

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

73

78
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's exceptional just to have the royal family
leave Ryuuguu Palace and walk around the kingdom.</font>

79
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But for the sake of a single citizen,
she's willing to shed tears and slap him.</font>

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama truly is an unusual queen!</font>

81
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly a loving person.
Look!  Even the children adore her!</font>

82
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama!</font>

83
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do this all for the sake of you children.</font>

84

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaat?!</i></font>

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your nose is running.
For your sake, I had to slap you!</font>

86
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You look like a fool,
with snot running out of one nostril.</font>

87
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If your nose is going to run,
it should run out of both nostrils.</font>

88
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so touching!</font>

89
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it?</font>

90
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A passionately loving person.</font>

91
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime would come down from Ryuuguu Palace every day,</font>

92
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and appeal to the citizens of the kingdom.</font>

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must bring Ryuuguu Kingdom up to the surface!</font>

94
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"The color of their skin is different.
So is the shape of their bodies."</font>

95
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should not wait for the humans,
who think like that, to understand us.</font>

96
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead, we should approach them ourselves and learn about their ways!</font>

97
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are ten thousand meters between the sea floor and the surface.</font>

98
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The same distance separates
the humans' way of thinking and our own.</font>

99
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not misunderstand!</font>

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The humans who come to this island
are a certain type of humans called pirates.</font>

101
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the ones who buy people from slave traders are an elite minority called Nobles.</font>

102
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are biased because we only come into contact
with certain kinds of humans.</font>

103
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still do not know anything about them.</font>

104
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Certainly, there must be many kind-hearted humans up on the surface as well!</font>

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will bring our kingdom up there,
so that we may live together under the same sun!</font>

106
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this year's world council meeting,
let us express our wish to emigrate into their world!</font>

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you, please sign this petition.</font>

108
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know...
Even if it's you asking, Queen Otohime.</font>

109
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Compromising with the humans.  I just don't know.</font>

110
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should not say that.</font>

111
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rather than never trying because we think it
can't be done, we should take the first step ourselves!</font>

112
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, then!</font>

113
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

114
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use.  History has already given its answer.</font>

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back, children.</font>

116
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome home, Mother!</font>

117
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back, Shirahoshi.</font>

118
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, Shirahoshi, my oasis of peace.</font>

119
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am sorry for being late.</font>

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, you have snot hanging out of your nose,
and yet you are still so cute.</font>

121
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were with her the whole time, so she's alright, Mother!</font>

122
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's alright, she's alright!</font>

123
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, my dear princes.</font>

124
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother, is your hand alright?</font>

125
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, this is nothing to worry about.</font>

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your mother will change the future you will live in!</font>

127
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Her Majesty wants to give a speech,
she should just do a video broadcast.</font>

128
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because of Kenbunshoku Haki that she was born with -jamon.</font>

129
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She doesn't want to talk from a palace up in the sky,</font>

130
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but to face them directly,
close enough to feel their hearts.</font>

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is what Otohime believes is right.
Even I cannot stop her.</font>

132
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there are so many human pirates on the island.</font>

133
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we're being protected by
the authority of your friend, the pirate Whitebeard,</font>

134
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you never know what might happen.</font>

135
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's aware of that.</font>

136
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The world that Otohime dreams of
is an ambition from several hundred years ago.</font>

137
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our distant ancestors had the same dream,
but they were never able to realize it during their time.</font>

138
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?!</font>

139
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I cannot stop Otohime.</font>

140
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure to protect her for me.</font>

141
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

142
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This Otohime-san was
a pretty strange person, wasn't she?</font>

143
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You cry all the time...
Is that something you got from your mother?</font>

144
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... W-Who knows.</font>

145
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were a soldier in this country?</font>

146
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was pretty much the only option I had, growing up in the Fishman District and only knowing how to fight.</font>

147
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Fishman District?</font>

148
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi, isn't that where you're from, too?</font>

149
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sounds like a kind of scary place.</font>

150
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed... Though in the past,</font>

151
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it used to be a giant orphanage that
took care of the children that didn't have relatives.</font>

152
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But before long, the inhabitants began to fight and
it became too much for the administration to handle.</font>

153
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has turned into a lawless zone where
all the outcasts from Fishman Island gather.</font>

154
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who used to be
the leader of the Fishman District, Fisher Tiger,</font>

155
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">eventually left the country to go on an adventure.</font>

156
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I, who was supposed to succeed him,
joined the royal army.</font>

157
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Macro Crew, despite being fishmen,
went on to become slave traders themselves.</font>

158
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the others...</font>

159
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They all went their own separate ways.</font>

160
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then, one day...</font>

161
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, give it back!</font>

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want it back, then why don't you try taking it?</font>

163
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give it back!</font>

164
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea how many signatures there are on those sheets?!</font>

165
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why should I care how many signatures there are?!</font>

166
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop right there!
You're Arlong from the Fishman District, aren't you?!</font>

167
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong from the Fishman District?</font>

168
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Let me go!</font>

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not quite right.</font>

170
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Captain Arlong, of the Arlong Pirates!</font>

171
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I live by hunting those inferior pirates...</font>

172
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who have the run of this place
even though they can't breathe underwater.</font>

173
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm hunting down pirates in your place!</font>

174
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Neptune Army should pay me to show their gratitude!</font>

175
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Boss Jinbe...
Don't just sit there and watch.  Help me!</font>

176
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe?</font>

177
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:07,740
<font face="Kozuka Gothic Pro B" size="45">Ryuuguu Kingdom, Soldier in the Neptune Army
Jinbe, 30 years old</font>

178
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hoodlum.  Let go of that rookie!</font>

179
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He happens to be my underling.</font>

180
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and while I have no interest in
that paper with the signatures on it,</font>

181
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it's really important to the Queen.  So give it back!</font>

182
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Boss Jinbe from the Neptune Army!</font>

183
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're saved!</font>

184
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss, huh?  That's a good title for you!</font>

185
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't find another soldier
that acts more like a mafia boss, after all!</font>

186
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do as I say, Arlong!</font>

187
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine, I got it.  Here.</font>

188
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here you go!</font>

189
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, don't be so upset, Brother.</font>

190
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Brother?</font>

191
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time, no see.  We're comrades from the Fishman District, aren't we?</font>

192
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lump me in with you.</font>

193
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're still a pirate?  Scum!</font>

194
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't call me scum, Brother!</font>

195
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then is trash better?</font>

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trash?!</font>

197
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought of you like a brother,
but you still speak to me like that?</font>

198
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, everyone!  It's Fisher Tiger-san, the adventurer!</font>

199
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tiger-san has returned!</font>

200
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tiger-san!</font>

201
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell us about your voyage!</font>

202
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother Ti!</font>

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Brother!</font>

204
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, Arlong!  You look like you're doing well.</font>

205
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your journey was quite long this time.</font>

206
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  A lot of things happened.</font>

207
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to my ship!</font>

208
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, later.  First of all,
I have some business at Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

209
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then allow me to take you there.</font>

210
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like he has no business with pirates.</font>

211
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  Big Brother never said anything like that!</font>

212
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try to get along, will you?</font>

213
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want to free the slaves?</font>

214
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't take it anymore.</font>

215
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being a slave is living hell.</font>

216
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even now, as we speak, I'm sure they're being treated in utterly inhumane ways.</font>

217
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But still...</font>

218
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've made up my mind.</font>

219
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... What did you see on your latest voyage?</font>

220
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans.</font>

221
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And not long after that, a major incident occurred.</font>

222
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big news!</font>

223
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

224
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Boss Jinbe!</font>

225
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Tiger-san... attacked the Celestial Dragons!</font>

226
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons?!</font>

227
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger attacked the Holy Land, Mariejoa.</font>

228
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He came to be known as
the hero who freed the slaves.</font>

229
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the same time,
he was labeled a dangerous criminal.</font>

230
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As of this moment, I am resigning.</font>

231
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe!  Are you going to abandon your duties in the army?!</font>

232
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The duty of protecting the island
suited me better than I thought it would.</font>

233
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, there are times when one's morals are more important than one's duty!</font>

234
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Brother Ti has finally done it!</font>

235
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Arlong Pirates will join with Fisher Tiger immediately!</font>

236
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, men!</font>

237
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And so the former outcasts of the Fishman District,
who all looked up to him, gathered together.</font>

238
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome to the pirate business.</font>

239
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From now on, the world itself will be our enemy.</font>

240
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All who are prepared for this, step forward!</font>

241
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To avoid discrimination between the former slaves who Tiger had freed and those who came freely...</font>

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">every member of the crew branded the emblem of the sun where it would hide the marks of slavery.</font>

243
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fishmen had formed the Sun Pirates.</font>

244
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he really went and did it.</font>

245
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island's standing has fallen once more.</font>

246
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We probably won't even be able to
attend this year's world council meeting.</font>

247
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should we do about this?</font>

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, on that day...</font>

249
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't have stopped him.</font>

250
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You... What did you see on your latest voyage?</i></font>

251
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Humans.</i></font>

252
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I listened to his heartfelt voice, it was screaming terribly.</font>

253
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Extra!  Extra!  Breaking news!</font>

254
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He made a surprise attack on the Celestial Dragons.  People aren't even supposed to touch them!</font>

255
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Fisher Tiger, the hero of Fishman Island!</font>

256
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!  A fishman's made history!</font>

257
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, please listen!</font>

258
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's Queen Otohime!</font>

259
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This again?</font>

260
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were all afraid.  We ran away and hid ourselves.</font>

261
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what have we learned from that?</font>

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just because some human nobles
have committed unforgivable crimes against us,</font>

263
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishmankind must not start
mercilessly killing all humans.</font>

264
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, let us try to coexist with the humans.</font>

265
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us try to learn more about the surface dwellers
who live under the shining sun.</font>

266
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know more than enough about them.</font>

267
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I feel bad for the Queen, but...</font>

268
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two, over there!</font>

269
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sign this.</font>

270
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't, Otohime-sama.</font>

271
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, everyone on the island is in support of Tiger's amazing feat.</font>

272
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This incident's going to mean a complete separation from the humans.</font>

273
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the humans are obviously in the wrong...</font>

274
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So right now, we just can't...</font>

275
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's impossible now then we can wait seven, eleven, or even fifteen years.  Whatever it takes.</font>

276
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the day when this country
participates in the world council meeting again...</font>

279
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like when he was boss of the Fishman District.</font>

280
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It says the Celestial Dragons are really pissed off.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know, <i>those</i> Celestial Dragons.</font>

282

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah?!</font>

283
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took out those sickening humans.</font>

284
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All humans are trash.</font>

285
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like Arlong-san always says.</font>

286
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They really are inferior!</font>

287
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sun Pirates on the surface, going wherever they want and beating up all the humans -dosun.</font>

288
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're amazing -dosun.</font>

289
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we were stronger,
we could have gone up there with them -hi.</font>

290
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!  Great!  One day, I'll join 'em!</font>

291
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take them out, Sun Pirates!  Kill the human scum!</font>

292
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

293
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!  Boss!  An enemy ship's been spotted -nyuu!</font>

294
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!  Boss!  Boss!</font>

295
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Ti!  There's trouble!</font>

296
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, shut up, Hachi!</font>

297
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you calm down?</font>

298
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure are noisy.  Is it the Navy?</font>

299
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no mistake, it's the Sun Pirates.</font>

300
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take Tiger's head!</font>

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You missed!</font>

302
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

303
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!  Aim properly!</font>

304
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're submerged under the water!</font>

305
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoops.</font>

306
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn fishmen!</font>

307
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hand over all the runaway slaves!</font>

308
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then maybe we'll overlook your crimes.</font>

309
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Rear Admiral...
T-They're attacking through the hull.</font>

310
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

311
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quietly hand over the slaves!</font>

312
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you're doing is a major crime!</font>

313
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Attacking humans?  Fishmen should know their place!</font>

314
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?  Say it again.</font>

315
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just try to say it again!</font>

316
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help...</font>

317
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn slavery is okay, but liberation's a crime?</font>

318
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And she wants us to love the humans?</font>

319
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Queen Otohime...</font>

320
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!  Fire!</font>

321
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aim and fire!  We've got the intel!</font>

322
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're harboring runaway slaves!</font>

323
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way?!</font>

324
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Runaway slaves, you say?</font>

325
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he a monster?!</font>

326
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you see any evidence of them here?</font>

327
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at all of our bodies.</font>

328
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mark that runaway slaves are supposed to have...</font>

329
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you see anyone here with it?</font>

330
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lemme go!  Stop it!  What're you doing?!</font>

331
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!  Help!</font>

332
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Relax.  I'm going to let you go.</font>

333
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not like you humans.</font>

334
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up men! Grab their loot and food,
and get back to our ship!</font>

335
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sentence you to death.</font>

336
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Human, your very existence is an inexcusable crime.</font>

337
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it!  Arlong!</font>

338
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die!</font>

339
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-Admiral Borsalino...</font>

340
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unit G2, Rear Admiral Kadaru's ship... has been lost.</font>

341
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?  Why'd they try to fight them?</font>

342
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told them to just report their location.</font>

343
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're saying that if you get close enough to see them then they'll surround you.</font>

344
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, how scary... Guess I shouldn't expect any less
from underwater professionals.</font>

345
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So?  What kind of people were on the ship?</font>

346
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir.</font>

347
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some pirates who were recently on the sea floor
near Fishman Island, Arlong's crew, are on the ship.</font>

348
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since they're naturally adept at fighting in the water, it's difficult to measure their combat abilities.</font>

349
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong... I've heard the rumors.</font>

350
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's also talk of
another strongly built man in Tiger's ranks.</font>

351
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's incredibly strong,
but we don't even know his name.</font>

352
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, how troubling.</font>

353
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurt!</font>

354
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that for?!</font>

355
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just because I took out one or two pieces of inferior trash?!</font>

356
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two went too far.</font>

357
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not some band of common murderers.</font>

358
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get carried away!</font>

359
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, Brother Ti... I mean, Boss,</font>

360
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they were shooting to kill you.</font>

361
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only natural that we should hit them back just as hard!</font>

362
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes us mad, after all!</font>

363
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We lose if we kill them.</font>

364
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you want to become like them?!</font>

365
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't a mission of revenge for the history of segregation.</font>

366
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What I did at Mariejoa wasn't either.</font>

367
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may have broken their ridiculous laws, but
it was only to free those who were being oppressed!</font>

368
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sun Pirates fight for freedom and liberty.
Nothing else!</font>

369
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we hold onto grudges and
start taking revenge on the humans,</font>

370
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it will just spawn more tragedy
since the humans will try to get revenge in turn.</font>

371
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Future fishmen, innocent of any crime,
will be punished for the crimes of their ancestors!</font>

372
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you understand?!</font>

373
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can fight and steal from
those who pursue us, but that's the line.</font>

374
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't kill anyone!</font>

375
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been wanting to say something
to you for a while now, Big Brother.</font>

376
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Worried about the humans taking revenge?</font>

377
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they <i>try</i> to take revenge, we can just kill them!</font>

378
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should be so brutal
that the humans tremble in fear before us!</font>

379
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we do that, they won't even think of striking back.</font>

380
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just don't know about
the strength and ruthlessness of fishmen.</font>

381
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should burn it into their eyes...</font>

382
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fear us!</font>

383
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell're you doing?!</font>

384
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe, Queen Otohime's campaign is the ideal solution.</font>

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To her, what's the difference between me and Arlong?</font>

386
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The thing that scares me the most
is the demon living in my heart.</font>

387
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyuu- A pirate ship!</font>

388
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a huge ship!</font>

389
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're trying to get famous by defeating us.</font>

390
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So now we have to deal with guys like this too?</font>

391
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we keep sinking them,
they'll stop coming eventually.</font>

392
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were wanted by the Government and had to fight every day.</font>

393
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime also tried to
fight against the world in her own way.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sign it!</font>

395
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To live together with the humans?</font>

396
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll pass, Your Majesty.</font>

397
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sign it!</font>

398
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Bounties have been placed
on Boss Ti's and Jinbe-san's heads!</font>

399
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

400
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow!  230 million beli!</font>

401
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Jinbe's at 76 million beli!</font>

402
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanted posters!
It looks like their bounties have gone up!  Wow!</font>

403
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like the World Government is shaking in their boots.</font>

404
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Down with the Navy!</font>

405
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sign it!</font>

406
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me a break!</font>

407
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was like that for three years.</font>

408
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then I encountered a girl on a certain island.</font>

409
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you do us a favor?</font>

410
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three years ago, when you freed us slaves,
this girl escaped from Mariejoa with us.</font>

411
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you can see.</font>

412
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the town where her family lives
is quite far from here.</font>

413
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wanted to take her
but we can't sail these dangerous seas.</font>

414
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Koala.  I'm eleven years old.</font>

415
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much for saving me three years ago.</font>

416
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if she's just a kid,
she's still human!  Disgusting!</font>

417
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you let a human on the same ship as us?</font>

418
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's progress.</font>

419
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit grinning like that!  You're really pissing me off!</font>

420
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san!</font>

421
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san!</font>

422
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lemme go, Hachi!  I'm not finished!</font>

423
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  She never stops smiling, and it's kind of creepy.</font>

424
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

425
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.  I'll work.</font>

426
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do all the cleaning and never stop to rest,
so please do not hit me.</font>

427
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

428
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.</font>

429
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?</font>

430
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

431
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.</font>

432
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you're bleeding.</font>

433
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

434
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, I won't cry.  So please don't kill me.</font>

435
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you can stop that.  Do you think we're so scary?</font>

436
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, but I want to see my mother.</font>

437
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I grit my teeth and boarded your ship.</font>

438
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I take a break, you might kill me, right?</font>

439
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make myself useful, so please do not kill me.</font>

440
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She knows nothing other than slavery.</font>

441
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A slave may be killed for something as trivial as crying.</font>

442
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can also be killed for
taking a break from cleaning.</font>

443
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're always thinking, "Maybe I'm next."
They live in continual fear but won't show it.</font>

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss.</font>

445
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring this kid to my room.</font>

446
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're they doing in there?</font>

447
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giving her a lecture won't help.  Her spirit's been broken.</font>

448
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!  What're you doing in there!?</font>

449
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cauterizing the wound.</font>

450
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's violent, but as long as she bore the mark
she'd never forget things that are best forgotten.</font>

451
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you alive?</font>

452
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, she's awake!</font>

453
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems I fainted.  I'm sorry.</font>

454
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But look, I didn't cry.  So please do not kill me.</font>

455
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what you do to me,
I won't cry.  So please do not kill me.</font>

456
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing wrong with crying!</font>

457
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think that we're the same
as those stupid Celestial Dragons.</font>

458
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch closely.</font>

459
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't kill anyone.</font>

460
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men, we're off!</font>

461
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to take this girl...</font>

462
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and make sure she gets home!</font>

464
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the Sun Pirates are ambushed by the Navy,
and Tiger is confronted by Strawberry.</font>

465
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After a bloody battle, Tiger reveals his shocking past.</font>

466
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After Tiger's death, many of the citizens on Fishman Island withdraw their signatures.</font>
