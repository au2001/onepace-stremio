it had to be him.</font>

113
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... why would he disappear?</font>

114
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-<i>kun</i>...</font>

anything from my friends.</i></font>

117
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he feels embarrassed.</font>

118
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Sanji! Come on out!</font>

119
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here to pick you up!</font>

120
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,670

121
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, let's split up and search!</font>

122
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going this way!

123
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going straight!</font>

124
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where the sweet caramel-like
smell is coming from!</font>

125
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I'll go this way!
Look at those beautiful jellybeans!</font>

126
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! I don't want a secondary disaster!</font>

127
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! We just lost him,
so all we can do is follow our gut.</font>

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how people who get lost would think.</font>

129
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plus, aren't you guys being motivated 
by some other cravings?!</font>

130
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some other?</font>

131
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, we aren't.</font>

132
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lie!</font>

133
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! I'll search with you guys!
All three of you, stay with me! Okay?</font>

134
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mm-hm. Got it!</font>

135
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– This flower is candy!
– Really?!</font>

136
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where the caramel smell comes from!</font>

137
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so sweet! It sticks to my teeth!</font>

138
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so happy!</font>

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, guys! Do you remember?
We're here to pick up Sanji-<i>kun<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

140
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are too distracted by the candy!</font>

141
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought we were gonna look for Sanji-<i>kun<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

142
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know!</font>

143
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there are sweets everywhere!</font>

144
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you think that's strange?!
We're in the enemy's territory!</font>

145
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll search to some extent,
and if we can't find him, we'll go back.</font>

146
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

147
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

148
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This green river! It's melon juice!</font>

149
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?! Let me try!</font>

150
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you take a close look at this bridge,
it's a donut!</font>

151
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! That's enough!</font>

152
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cross the bridge!</font>

153
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a crocodile!</font>

155
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you wanna take it down, Luffy?!</font>

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

157
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, just humans.</font>

158
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you think we were?!</font>

159
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not important!</font>

160
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crocodile is wearing clothes and a hat
and he talked!</font>

161
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as I thought,
this forest is dangerous and strange!</font>

162
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that surprises you, take a look at us.</font>

163
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I know what you mean, but...</font>

164
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think we'd better trust Pudding
and wait by the sea!</font>

165
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure she'll bring Sanji-<i>kun<font size="10"> </font></i></font>!

166
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And look!
Our road back is already problematic!</font>

167
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be fine. If we jump over
the river, we can always go back.</font>

168
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

170
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

171
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another Luffy?!</font>

172
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

173
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Who are you?!
– Who are you?!</font>

174
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– "Who are you?!" I'm Luffy! Stop mocking me!
– "Who are you?!" I'm Luffy! Stop mocking me!</font>

175
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!
Which one is the real Luffy?!</font>

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They move and talk exactly the same!</font>

177
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they're a bit different!</font>

178
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like a mirror image, his scar and accessories
and everything are inverted.</font>

179
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really looks like there's a mirror!
Who is that?!</font>

180
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

181
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– She's asking who you are! Answer her, you idiot!
– She's asking who you are! Answer her, you idiot!</font>

182
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is! I found Sanji!</font>

183
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There! Up in the tree!</font>

184
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Sanji!</font>

185
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way, you fool!</font>

186
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-<i>kun</i>, what are you doing up there?!</font>

187
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, he's running again! Sanji!</font>

188
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard! Outta my way!</font>

189
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! You guys, go ahead!
Chase him!</font>

190
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Okay!</font>

191
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming too!</font>

192
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get separated!
Chopper! Carrot!</font>

193
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forest is strange!
Something's gonna happen again!</font>

194
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know! But if we lose Sanji again...</font>

195
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

196
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, go with them!</font>

197
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll catch up with you after I beat him up!</font>

198
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, okay!</font>

199
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum-Gum...</font>

201
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

202
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who the hell are you?!</font>

203
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

204
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-There's a humongous half-buried man!</font>

205
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a giant!</font>

206
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– You scared me!
– We should be saying that!</font>

207
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?!
Who did this to you?!</font>

208
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

209
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your body is half buried!</font>

210
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm half buried because I want to be.</font>

211
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Is he stupid?!
I shouldn't have been worried!</font>

212
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The thing is...</font>

213
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna have some juice.</font>

214
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care!</font>

215
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, don't take him seriously!
He'll drive you crazy!</font>

216
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, wait, you guys.</font>

217
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's saying something.</font>

218
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ignore him!</font>

219
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like apple juice very much.</font>

220
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– So what?!
– Don't listen to him.</font>

221
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you go left,
there are waterfalls of apple juice.</font>

222
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like them very much.</font>

223
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember what Luffy told us?
We should be looking for Sanji-<i>kun</i>.</font>

224
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I dreaming?</font>

225
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're looking for someone, aren't you?
He came this way.</font>

226
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Did he?!</font>

227
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said, "Don't take him seriously!"</font>

228
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get me some apple juice,
I'll tell you.</font>

229
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, okay.</font>

230
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out! Nami! Chopper!</font>

231
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rabbit?!</font>

232
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Let's run!</font>

233
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are talking trees and crocodiles,
and the rabbit was trying to kill us!</font>

234
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is weird.
Let's go back to see Luffy!</font>

235
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still know the way!</font>

236
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, what about Sanji?!</font>

237
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know
if he was real or not anymore!</font>

238
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We finally saw each other,
but he didn't even get up!</font>

239
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't say anything!</font>

240
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

241
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if that's the real Sanji-<i>kun</i>,</font>

242
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">do you think he'd just stand by
and watch us going through this?!</font>

243
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right. Let's go back.</font>

244
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The needles are...</font>

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here?!</font>

387
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't yell. It scares me.</font>

388
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:08,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you ask why I'm here?
I was here the whole time!</font>

389
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's you guys that left and came back.</font>

390
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Chopper, let's try again!
– Uh-huh!</font>

391
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Pull out the thing
that's stuck in my head!</font>

392
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Running through the field of lollipops...</font>

393
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jumping over the crocodile's river...</font>

394
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get to the coast this time!</font>

395
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You scared me!</font>

396
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you guys keep coming back here?</font>

397
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again?! Even without the log pose working,</font>

398
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we don't need to know the directions,
because it's one simple path!</font>

399
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Going straight back this way...</font>

400
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slowly... Slowly...</font>

401
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oops.</font>

402
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flower?!</font>

403
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! The trees and flowers are moving!</font>

404
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One, two! One, two!</font>

405
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soil is moving and talking!</font>

406
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

407
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are those things?
What's with this forest?!</font>

408
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– They found out!
– They did!</font>

409
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,720
<font face="Duality" size="55" color="#4e5998">♪ Flower! ♪</font>

410
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was no path from the beginning!</font>

411
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You finally became aware...</font>

412
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">of the terror of this forest!</font>

413
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy, what are you doing?!</font>

414
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Seducing Woods!</font>

415
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami! That's not Luffy!</font>

416
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

417
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who am I?</font>

418
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were together the whole time!</font>

419
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how many times you try,
you'll never get out of this forest!</font>

420
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never...</font>

421
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not until you die!</font>

422
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me!</font>

423
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down, young girl.</font>

424
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the scar on my face.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it terrible?</font>

428
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?! A tree?</font>

429
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a damn tree! I'm Brûlée!</font>

430
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,650

When I see your beautiful faces...</font>
