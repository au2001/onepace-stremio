10
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never would have thought that
the Sun Pirates would align with Big Mom.</font>

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they really okay with it?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be quite a stretch to call her a reasonable woman,
but she gives us a lot of freedom.</font>

13
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I just thought...</font>

14
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a man like you would never
work under anyone but Fisher Tiger.</font>

15
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,150

18
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">having an alliance with one of the Four Emperors is the best way to protect your crew.</font>

19
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  It seems to me
that you did it to protect Fishman Island.</font>

20
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of your actions,</font>

21
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island has been able
to use Big Mom's name after Whitebeard's death,</font>

22
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and so we've stayed relatively safe.</font>

23
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's just a coincidence.</font>

24
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Normally we would protect the island ourselves, but...</font>

25
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">seeing as how we're wanted men...</font>

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, Your Majesty.</font>

27
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm thinking of separating myself from Big Mom.</font>

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?  Are you going to accept Luffy-kun's offer?</font>

29
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, Jinbe. </i></font>

00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Join my crew! </i></font>

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I have been considering it.</font>

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there are duties and obligations I must take into account.</font>

33
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've formed promises and bonds through words and shared cups.</font>

34
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, if I break those bonds I have to be prepared...</font>

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a worst case scenario,</font>

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we can't rule out the possibility
that Big Mom's anger could engulf this island.</font>

37
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always, you try to carry too much responsibility on your shoulders -jamon, Jinbe.</font>

38
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that comes to pass, then we'll deal with it then.</font>

39
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have plans of my own -jamon.</font>

40
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just today, I gained seventy thousand new soldiers from the Fishman District, even if they're rowdy.</font>

41
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry -jamon.</font>

42
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And besides,
even if this island does lose Big Mom's flag,</font>

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there's another flag
I would love to borrow for protection.</font>

44
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The flag with a skull wearing a straw hat -jamon!</font>

45
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!  That is a nice flag, isn't it?</font>

46
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your Majesty!</i></font>

47
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-T-T-This is awful!</font>

48
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

49
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Right Minister?  Why are you panicking?</font>

50
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I remembered something awful!</font>

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's about our promise to give all the stolen treasure to Luffy-kun's crew if they found it.</font>

52
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they <i>do</i> find it,
please make them return the Tamate Box, at least!</font>

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?!</font>

54
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promised them that they could have it, and I won't tell them to give it back now!</font>

55
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But...</font>

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  If they open it, it'll explode?!</font>

57
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you put a bomb in it?!</font>

58
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Well, you see...</font>

59
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years ago,
when someone emptied the Tamate Box,</font>

60
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we figured we'd set up a trap so that if another treasure thief showed up, they wouldn't get away.</font>

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we filled the box with bombs...</font>

62
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and made it so that if it was opened, it would cause a huge explosion.</font>

63
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As the one who holds the key
to the treasure chamber and the Tamate Box, I...</font>

64
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I understand.</font>

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Luffy-kun and the others find the treasure, you'll explain the situation and ask them to return the box.</font>

66
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really sorry about this!</font>

67
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what if Luffy-kun and the others open it before they get back?</font>

68
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried about that, too.</font>

69
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!  Right Minister!</font>

70
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san and his group
just returned to Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

71
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  They made it back without any trouble?</font>

72
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness!
I suppose I shouldn't have worried so much.</font>

73
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!</i></font>

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gave...</font>

75
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom...</font>

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all the treasure?!</font>

77
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was saying something about how
she'd destroy Fishman Island if she didn't get candy!</font>

78
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's crazy!  I mean, I'd understand
if it was meat she was talking about...</font>

79
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't worry about it!</font>

80
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I picked a fight with her!</font>

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>With one of the Four Emperors?!</i></font>

82
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You picked a fight with Big Mom?!</font>

83
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're strong, right, Luffy-sama?</font>

84
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not the issue here!</font>

85
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noseopp-sama, you're so scary...</font>

86
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you, my name is Usopp!</font>

87
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

88
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a bother... This is not good.</font>

89
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to cut my ties with Big Mom before the whole deal breaks down.</font>

90
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, don't do anything
that might make Big Mom angrier than she is already.</font>

91
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we won't!  If we get on the bad side of one of the Four Emperors, we'll be obliterated instantly!</font>

92
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, isn't this really bad, Right Minister?</font>

93
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could this happen?!</font>

94
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now the Tamate Box will end up with Big Mom,</font>

95
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and if she opens it herself, she'll take the explosion
as a declaration of war from Luffy-san!</font>

96
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just awful -jamon!</font>

97
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's not like there's anything we can do about it.</font>

98
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's done is done.</font>

99
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll reap what we've sowed.
I suppose there's no way out of fighting her now.</font>

100
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  No matter who the enemy is, we'll-</font>

101
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why...</font>

102
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">did you give her <i>all</i> the treasure?!</font>

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's the problem?!</i></font>

104
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna punch you!</font>

105
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, you already did!</font>

106
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awlight... Wet'hs go to da New Wold.</font>

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,590

someone wandered off with all my treasure!</font>

111
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did it?!  I'm definitely gonna kill'em!</font>

112
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,960

113
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a mountain of treasure
and the secret about the Mermaid Princess!</font>

114
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280

115
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are those two guys carrying gigantic sacks?</font>

116
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it!  No doubt about it!</font>

117
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,840

118
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the treasure I stole!  Give it back, damn you!</font>

119
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

122
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,710

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A turtle?</font>

130
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a Devil Fruit user?</font>

131
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I am!</font>

132
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's just a Zoan-type fruit, huh?!</font>

133
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die!</font>

134
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:29,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Logia-users who think they're invincible
don't live very long.</font>

135
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Half-boiled challengers
are always so disappointing -<i>soir.</i></font>

136
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to go -<i>bon</i>, Pekoms.</font>

137
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back to Mama.</font>

138
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took out a man worth 200 million in one hit.</font>

139
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I remember it right,
Sir Pekoms's bounty is 330 million.</font>

140
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bounty over 300 million. That's how strong the crews of the Four Emperors are?</font>

141
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will Luffy-san and the others really be alright?</font>

142
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Meanwhile, in the New World,
in the waters near the Red Line...</i></font>

143
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

144
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!  Another ship emerging at two o'clock!</font>

145
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate ships are emerging from the sea,
one after another!</font>

146
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?!</font>

147
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think you'll make her like you by doing that?</font>

148
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shaddup!  Back off!</font>

149
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've finally been freed from Hell!  There's no way...</font>

150
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here comes a big one!</font>

151
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The captain is in trouble!</font>

152
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll hold her tight to shield her from harm!</font>

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, let me handle that vital mission!</font>

154
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh!</font>

155
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again?!</font>

156
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!  That's our Captain-chan!</font>

157
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her swordplay is just too beautiful for words!</font>

158
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that isn't the only thing that's beautiful about her!</font>

159
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this seriously, all of you!</font>

160
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Haven't you been trained
to shield yourselves from bombardments?!</font>

161
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you aren't going to show the results
of your training now, then when will you?!</font>

162
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, that's the mast.</font>

163
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finished polishing your glasses!</font>

164
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

165
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's so cute!
The lone flower growing in the filth of G-5!</font>

166
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you keep fooling around like this in battle...</font>

167
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're going to get yourselves killed immediately!</font>

168
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You G-5 soldiers are just hopeless.</font>

169
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you call yourselves marines?!</font>

170
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you look down on me
for being a girl, you'll regret it!</font>

171
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't look down on you!
We're just drawn to your cuteness!</font>

172
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what I meant by looking down on me!</font>

173
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't understand what a marine is supposed to-</font>

174
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet, Tashigi.</font>

175
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in the middle of an interrogation.</font>

176
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon me!</font>

177
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  So you were all captured
by the pirate Hody Jones on the ocean floor?</font>

178
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That explains why no rookies
have made it past Fishman Island in the past month.</font>

179
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captured?!  That's not it, we were his slaves!</font>

180
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But a certain pirate crew defeated Hody's group,
who were also behind the rebellion,</font>

181
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and freed us!</font>

182
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A certain pirate crew?</font>

183
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't tell you who they were, but...</font>

184
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You dumbass!  Just tell him already!</font>

185
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys aren't normal marines!  They're the G-5!</font>

186
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They use pirates as bait to go fishing for sharks,</font>

187
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or burn pirates as firewood on their campfires!</font>

188
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're a group of insane maverick marines who don't even obey the orders from HQ!</font>

189
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they arrest us,
there's no telling what they'll do to us!</font>

190
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And of all people, we had to get caught...</font>

191
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by the White Hunter, Smoker!</font>

192
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-admiral Smoker! 
Won't you give these guys to us?</font>

193
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please don't!</font>

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll say who it was!  Spare us!</font>

195
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ones who defeated Hody's crew...</font>

196
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

197
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know,</font>

198
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">idiot.</font>

199
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly, Luffy-chin's crew is about to leave.</font>

200
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they now?  Go see them off.</font>

201
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

202
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Madame!  Can we go too?</i></font>

203
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, you all want to go?
Well, I guess I'll have to close the café for a while.</font>

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That idiot Hody was blocking our customers,
but they'll be back soon enough.</font>

205
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope you'll continue to make the café an enjoyable place to be, girls.</font>

206
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to us, Madame!</font>

207
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, the crystal ball?</font>

208
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind that.  I've had enough.</font>

209
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never predict the future again.</font>

210
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy destroying Fishman Island...</font>

211
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I'd never seen that horrible future.</font>

212
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would be for the best if it turns out that the prediction was wrong.</font>

213
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's never been wrong,
so she must be more scared than any of us.</font>

214
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no guarantee that a future she's seen
will occur immediately.</font>

215
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It could happen a year from now,
or it could take even longer.</font>

216
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no definite proof that she was wrong.</font>

217
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you know, Madame,
Luffy-chin and his group would never-</font>

218
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie.</font>

219
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please forgive me for doubting your friends.</font>

220
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand now.  We can trust him, right?</font>

221
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can trust the Straw Hat boy.</font>

222
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

223
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is all for you.  Please accept it!</font>

224
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, thanks!</font>

225
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, are all of you leaving already?</font>

226
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've only just become friends, at least stay one more day...</font>

227
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, one more week...</font>

228
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, just stay for one more year!</font>

229
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You kept crying
all the way to the very end, huh, Weak-Hoshi?</font>

230
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm so sorry!</font>

231
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stop being such a crybaby.</font>

232
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mermaid Princess of Fishman Island...</font>

233
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is crying because we're leaving!
I never thought this day would come!</font>

234
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really wish I could live here for a year!</font>

235
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand what you mean!</font>

236
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've even made a new single
about the dreamlike life here on Fishman Island!</font>

237
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Waking up with a Good Mor-<i>ningyo</i>!</font>

238
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Ningyo: Mermaid</i></font>

239
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my dear mermaids!</font>

240
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a fantastic idea.</font>

241
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By all means, stay here, Nosebleed-kun.</font>

242
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who</i> did you just call <i>what</i>, Moss-Head?!</font>

243
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who</i>'re you calling Moss-Head?!</font>

244
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

245
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really must tell them...</font>

246
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">about how the Tamate Box they sent to Big Mom...</font>

247
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will explode if it's opened!</font>

248
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

249
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">look at them.</font>

250
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over.  One of the Four Emperors wants us dead.  We're just going to die in the New World.</font>

251
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:26,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think Big Mom will forgive us
if we give her all the treasure we find from now on?</font>

252
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just can't bring myself to tell them...</font>

253
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that they've already sent her a bomb!</font>

254
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you know,
it's been ten years since you planted those bombs.</font>

255
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't there a chance that
they may have become duds in that time?</font>

256
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, Your Majesty, think positive!</font>

257
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a lot of moisture in Ryuuguu Palace, after all!</font>

258
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, there's no guarantee that Big Mom will open it herself!</font>

259
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then...</font>

260
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let's pray that things work out!</i></font>

261
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you two whispering about?</font>

262
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

263
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's... this?</font>

264
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Log Pose used in the New World.
Take it with you.</font>

265
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trying to navigate with just a single compass needle...
What are we to do with you?</font>

266
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  A new Log Pose?</font>

267
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool!</font>

268
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's got three needles!  Why?</font>

269
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the Log you've used up till now.</font>

270
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's moving back and forth!  I thought
the Log had adjusted itself to another island.</font>

271
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has.  From now on,
the Log will only need half a day to readjust itself.</font>

272
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the previous half of the Grand Line, the Log would adjust itself to the magnetic field of the next island,</font>

273
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and you could reliably continue your voyage.</font>

274
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're entering the second half now,</font>

275
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">where, in addition to
changing sea currents and climate,</font>

276
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">magnetic fields, the one thing you've been able to rely on until now, fluctuate as well!</font>

277
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The magnetic field of some islands might even disappear completely before you reach them!</font>

278
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  But then we couldn't even reach the island!</font>

279
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would be a disaster
if you only had one compass needle.</font>

280
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what could you do if you had three?</font>

281
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of them is shaking like our Log Pose...</font>

282
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the other two seem to be stable.</font>

283
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three compass needles
are all aligned to different islands' magnetic fields.</font>

284
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meaning, you have three different routes
and you can choose the one that looks the safest.</font>

285
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your decisions can mean
the difference between life and death!</font>

286
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skilled navigators can look at the slight movements of the needles and figure out the safest route.</font>

287
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To put it simply,
the more unstable the compass needle is...</font>

288
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the more dangerous the island it points to.</font>

289
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It means that something intense enough to disrupt the island's magnetic field is occuring there.</font>

290
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  No way!</font>

291
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're better off not knowing!</font>

292
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can tell how dangerous things are?!</font>

293
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't!  Destroy that Log Pose!</font>

294
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?  If you don't pick the safest route, you might...</font>

295
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see...</font>

296
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>O-Oh crap!</i></font>

297
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Noooooooo!</i></font>

298
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The island in the middle
with the really shaky needle looks fun!</font>

299
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-H-He heard!</font>

300
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you shut up!  I'll decide the route we'll take!</font>

301
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!  I'm the captain!</font>

302
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please, Captain!  Listen to what your navigator says!</i></font>

303
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san is so cute when she's scared!</font>

304
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So cute!  So cute!</font>

305
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The B-side of my single!  "Requiem For Us!"</font>

306
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, guys!  The preparations are complete!</font>

307
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Den-san has taught me how to control our ascent.</font>

308
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we go?</font>

309
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

310
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

311
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

312
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw!</font>

313
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm helping out with repairing the factory.</font>

314
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you be alright without a guide?</font>

315
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!  Our adventures coming here were fun too.</font>

316
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right!  We don't need a guide!</font>

317
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A true man's journey always leads straight into hell!</font>

318
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right!  This is war, you bastards!</font>

319
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're beginning to lose it.</font>

320
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Everyone, please come again!</i></font>

321
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I swear to return!</font>

322
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the All Blue of my heart!</font>

323
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a cheap dream you have.</font>

324
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

325
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I have are words,
but I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</font>

326
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will pray that your voyage is a safe one.</font>

327
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

328
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next time we meet,
we'll be leading the greatest army on the ocean floor!</font>

329
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mambo!</font>

330
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!  We will rewrite the legend of
the great Neptune Knights -mi fa so la ti do!</font>

331
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I look forward to it!</font>

332
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, where is he?</font>

333
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, there!</font>

334
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe!</font>

335
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it!</font>

336
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, hoist the sails!</font>

337
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to set sail!</font>

338
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

339
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See you later, Fishman Island!</font>

340
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back whenever you want, to eat candy and meat!</font>

341
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like humans now!</font>

342
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and raccoon dogs and robots too!</font>

343
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not happy at all, you jerks!</font>

344
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What?</font>

345
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about bones?</font>

346
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay well!  Luffy-chin, everyone!</font>

347
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back for some more Takoyaki someday!</font>

348
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I love you guys!</font>

349
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ready, and...</i></font>

350
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We like bones too!</i></font>

351
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for being so considerate!</font>

352
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

353
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weak-Hoshi!</font>

354
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi-chwan!</font>

355
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can ever... meet again...</font>

356
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I...</font>

357
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">won't be such a crybaby anymore!</font>

358
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please take me for another fun walk!</font>

359
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A walk?  You wanna go visit your mom again?</font>

360
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

361
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I want to go even further!</font>

362
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the real forests above the sea!</font>

363
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  You've never left the sea, have you?</font>

364
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, sure!</font>

365
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next time we meet, I'll take you there!</font>

366
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Promise me!</font>

367
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, you got it!</font>

368
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a promise!</font>

369
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!
Doesn't that put some responsibility on us too?</font>

370
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san, promises are something you must keep,
even if it kills you!</font>

371
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, Shirahoshi, I promise too!</font>

372
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-chin-sama!</font>

373
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too.</font>

374
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And me!</font>

375
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And me.</font>

376
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And me.</font>

377
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I promise too!</font>

378
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we all promise...</font>

379
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It should be alright.</font>

380
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's a promise!</i></font>

381
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">E-Everyone...</font>

382
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So don't cry any more!</font>

383
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

384
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never forget what they did for us.</font>

385
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Of course we won't!</i></font>

386
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Daddy!</font>

387
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buy me a straw hat!  I wanna play hero!</font>

388
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  They only sell those on the surface!</font>

389
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then go up there and buy one!</font>

390
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be a fool!  The surface is where
the terrifying humans who hate fishmen...</font>

391
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

392
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, no.  There are guys like him too, after all.</font>

393
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, there are plenty of strong,
kind-hearted people like Straw Hat up there too!</font>

394
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe!  Perfect timing!</font>

395
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't help overhearing you.</font>

396
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll send a merchant ship to get some straw hats.</font>

397
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

398
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

399
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the hat of a hero, after all!</font>

400
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

401
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was the best!</font>

402
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaid Paradise!</font>

403
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, everyone, you'd better quit slacking off!</font>

404
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that we're out in the sea,
there's no safe place anywhere!</font>

405
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna be passing through the dark sea again, after all.</font>

406
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that, Franky?</font>

407
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm making the ship rise by using
these cubes of highly buoyant taolfrepus wood.</font>

408
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can regulate our speed
by adjusting how many are out in the water.</font>

409
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Luffy?</font>

410
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we reach the surface...</font>

411
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'll be in the same sea as Shanks!</font>

412
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait to see him!</font>

413
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then...</i></font>

414
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll entrust you with this hat.</i></font>

415
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's my precious hat.</i></font>

416
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Come return it to me some day,</i></font>

417
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>when you've become a great pirate!</i></font>

418
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I only have... one regret. </i></font>

419
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That I couldn't see you... fulfill your dream.</i></font>

420
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But... I'm sure...</i></font>

421
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>you can make it.</i></font>

422
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're my little brother. </i></font>

423
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't just count everything you've lost! </i></font>

424
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's gone, is gone!
But ask yourself this, what remains?!</i></font>

425
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Keep going all the way to the top! </i></font>

426
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy-san, do you know what they call the second half of the Grand Line?</i></font>

427
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The final ocean that stretches out
on the other side of the Red Line...</i></font>

428
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>People call it by another name...</i></font>

429
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The New World!</i></font>

430
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The New World?</i></font>

431
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The ocean that beckons
those who'll forge a new era.</i></font>

432
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The one who conquers that ocean becomes the Pirate King!</i></font>

433
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once we make it to the surface...</font>

434
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we'll be in the world's strongest sea!</font>

435
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally!  I'll cut down anything in our way!</font>

436
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me, Laboon!  I'm halfway there!</font>

437
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, I'll take you anywhere!</font>

438
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  The Sunny can make it!</font>

439
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody has to worry about getting hurt!</font>

440
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat as much as you want, it won't bother me!</font>

441
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a warrior of the sea on this ship!</font>

442
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

443
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

444
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the New World!</font>

445
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Aye!</i></font>
