126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long until we reach Gyoncord Plaza?</font>

127
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's less than one hour away.</font>

128
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there's no way he'd go so far out of his way just to execute the king in the plaza.</font>

129
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That can't be their true motive.</font>

130
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All they want is to lure you out there!</font>

131
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter what their motives are.</font>

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is something we have to do.</font>

133
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let them lay a finger on Father.</font>

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let him close the hearts of the citizens that we worked so hard to open either!</font>

135
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess this is why Jinbe never took his eyes off Hody.</font>

136
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be because of Hody that no human pirates have been coming to the island lately.</font>

137
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi is probably still inside Koukaku Tower.</font>

138
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worried that we haven't received
any information on her -fa-so-la-ti-do!{TLC check this. あいつ is not the normal word for his sister.}</font>

139
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say, Brother Fukaboshi, what do you think of the Straw Hat Pirates?</font>

140
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly certainly predicted that they will destroy this island, but...</font>

141
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I met them face-to-face,
I certainly didn't feel any malice.</font>

142
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I agree.  They're friends with Jinbe too,</font>

143
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the mermaids in the bay
said that they're not bad people.</font>

144
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those mermaids' ability
to read personalities is quite sharp.</font>

145
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now is not the time to be worrying about things we don't understand.</font>

146
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's exactly right -la-ti-do!</font>

147
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gather all the soldiers in the country.  We will definitely rescue the king!</font>

148
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sir!</font>

151
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,830

152
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something strange about that beast.</font>

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The soldiers are all but finished!</font>

156
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop, Sea Bear!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost... {Swashbuckla: This sub appears a little early too.}</font>

255
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We almost made it!</font>

256
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looked like your dreams would've come to pass during this year's World Council Meeting...</font>

257
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime!</font>

258
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And all of a sudden, this happens!</font>

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate, the King will be killed!</font>

261
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, keep our King safe!</font>

262
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't get inside!
The entrance to Gyoncord Plaza has been shut!</font>

263
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,130

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's climb above the plaza!
We might be able to peek inside!</font>

265
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

266
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Megalo!</font>

267
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These soldiers claimed that
they were gonna protect the country!  How pathetic!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That soldier over there is up to something.</font>

271
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where?</font>

272
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gonna blow himself up with dynamite,
and try to take some of us with him -bokan!</font>

273
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Muhi!  If he does that, I'll turn into a fried squid -hi!</font>

274
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might help if I can take out
even one of Hody's men before the Princes get here!</font>

275
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy's dangerous!</font>

278
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

279
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

280
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hear something...</font>

281
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

282
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought the <i>Uchimizu</i> attack had only the same power as a bullet?</font>

283
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it is because you've
taken so many Energy Steroids, that was amazing -hi!</font>

284
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your hair's gone all white,
and your body has changed...</font>

285
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you feel, Captain?</font>

286
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never been better.</font>

287

288
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you wait for us?!</font>

289

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fukaboshi!  Ryuuboshi!  Manboshi!</font>

290
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful!  The sea beasts and
the fishmen have all taken drugs!</font>

291
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Figures.  Otherwise, I doubt the Neptune Army would have fallen so easily -re-mi-fa!</font>

292
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait just a little longer, Father!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The citizens of this island have turned their backs on
a long history of discrimination by the humans.</font>

296
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They let time wash away the deaths of a hero and the Queen even though humans killed them.</font>

297
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They clenched their teeth
and committed themselves to change the future...</font>

302
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kindness?  What good is that nonsense?</font>

303
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you <i>want</i> to be betrayed by the humans again?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The King's head, the home of the citizens, and Ryuuguu Kingdom itself...</font>

311
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will not let you take any of it!</font>

312

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're so strong!  I'd expect no less from the three brothers of Ryuuguu Kingdom!</font>
