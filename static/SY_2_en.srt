51
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So basically, on your signal,</font>

52

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the men and I storm

53
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And then you'll get her inheritance...</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You'll work hard to?</font>

57

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Working hard won't amount to squat.</font>

58
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,560

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Before</i> you kill her, you'll use hypnosis
to make Kaya write her will...</font>

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">to say: "I leave my entire fortune
to my butler, Klahadore!"</font>

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Only then will I inherit
her enormous fortune...</font>

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">in a completely ordinary manner.</font>

63
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've spent three long years gaining
the trust of everyone around me,</font>

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">so that it would be unsurprising
for her to leave her inheritance to me.</font>

65
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Three years as a butler for that, huh?</font>

66
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But you sure scared us back then,</font>

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Kuro.</font>

68
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Three years ago, you suddenly said
you were giving up life as a pirate.</font>

69
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In no time flat, you set up
a subordinate to be your double,</font>

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">then let the world see
Captain Kuro get executed.</font>

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So <i>that</i> was the beginning of <i>this</i> plan.</font>

72
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You truly are Kuro,
Man of a Thousand Plans.</font>

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't call me that.</font>

74
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I abandoned that name
three years ago.</font>

75
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I now want to obtain
great sums of money</font>

76
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">without the government on my back.</font>

77
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In other words, I'm a pacifist.</font>

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Some pacifist you are!</font>

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">killing off an entire rich family
for this "peace" of yours.</font>

80
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold on, now.
The father's death was real.</font>

81
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I hadn't planned on that.</font>

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well, whatever.</font>

83
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,320

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just hurry and give the signal.</font>

85
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We've been waiting in the waters
for almost a whole week now.</font>

86

88

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, what's going on?

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Weren't you listening this
whole time?! This is <i>seriously</i> bad!</font>

91
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They're the real deal!</font>

92

and most brutal pirate of all!</font>

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Rumor had it, the Marines caught
and executed him three years ago...</font>

94
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but Captain Kuro is alive!</font>

95
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,200

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's been after Kaya's fortune

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,670

99
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,380

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,720

101

123
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">...Jango!</font>

124
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, wake up, Jango!</font>

125
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Have you still not fixed
that habit yet?!</font>

126
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hey, what're you doing?!
You're gonna fall!</font>

127
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hmm, head-first...</font>

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I didn't <i>mean</i> to kill him,</font>

129
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but he couldn't have
survived from that height...</font>

130
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it!</font>

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He killed him!</font>

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That bastard! Damn it!</font>

133
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What about the other one?
Shall I take care of him?</font>

134
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No need.</font>

135
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No matter what he does,
it won't matter.{10:07}</font>

136
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak.{10:10, 16:42}</font>

137
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tear up the villagers' homes,</font>

138
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and make certain Miss Kaya's
murder looks like an accident!</font>

139
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tomorrow!</font>

140
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You heard me, Usopp{-kun}.</font>

141
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's nothing you can do
to stop my plan.</font>

142
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it!</font>

143
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You sure about him?</font>

144
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Of course. My plans are flawless.</font>

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is bad, this is bad, this is bad!</font>

146
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everyone in this village, who I
grew up with, is going to be killed!</font>

147
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kaya's going to be killed!</font>

148
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even though I love them all!</font>

149
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Who are you?!</i></font>

150
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I'm Usopp!
A brave warrior of the sea!</i></font>

151
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I hear you've been unhappy lately!</i></font>

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I'll cheer you up with a story!</i></font>

153
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Mind your own business!</i></font>

154
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Please leave! I'll call for someone!</i></font>

155
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>And then? What happened after that?!</i></font>

156
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I fought, of course! Bravely, at that!</i></font>

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it!</font>

158
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

159
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?</font>

160
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wasn't Luffy with him?</font>

161
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where's Luffy...?</font>

163
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is he still mad about
his dad being insulted?</font>

164
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who knows.</font>

165
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, that look was different!</font>

166
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, something must've happened!</font>

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why do you suppose he
looked so desperate?!</font>

168
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, how do we get
to this shore of yours?</font>

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Doesn't this smell like trouble?!</font>

170
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, something must've
happened at the shore!</font>

171
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I think this calls for the Usopp Pirates!</font>

172
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright, already!
How do we get there?!</font>

173
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Terrible news, everyone!</font>

174
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pirates are going to attack!</font>

175
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tomorrow morning, pirates are
going to attack this village!</font>

176
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everyone, run away!</font>

177
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright, Usopp! Enough is enough!</font>

178
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're gonna pay once and for all!</font>

179
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-No, it's not like that!</font>

180
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the truth this time!</font>

181
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shut up! All you ever do
is spout huge lies!{17:23}</font>

182
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you were as honest as
Klahadore{-san}, <i>then</i> we'd believe you!</font>

183
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>No matter what he does,
it won't matter.{07:11}</i></font>

184
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak!{07:17, 16:42}</i></font>

185
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn it!</font>

186
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So he ignored me because
nobody would believe me anyway?!</font>

187
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are these to your liking?</font>

188
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They're the ones you custom-ordered
from the eyewear shop...</font>

189
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">in the next town over.</font>

190
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, they're perfect!</font>

191
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm sorry for asking you
to go all the way there.</font>

192
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's a present, isn't it?</font>

193
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes.</font>

194
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tomorrow will be three years, since the day
Klahadore came to this mansion.</font>

195
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's always taken
good care of me, so...</font>

196
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore{-san} will be delighted!</font>

197
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes!</font>

198
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please hear me out, everyone!</font>

199
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pirates really <i>are</i> going to
attack tomorrow morning!</font>

200
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If we believed every
story you ever told,</font>

201
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">we'd have fled the village
hundreds of times by now!</font>

202
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please, believe me!
We gotta get out of here!</font>

203
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They really <i>are</i> going to kill everyone!</font>

204
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I swear it's the truth this time!</font>

205
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And <i>we're</i> gonna get you this time!</font>

206
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit!</font>

207
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get him! Don't let him escape!</font>

208
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thank you for coming, men.</font>

209
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's truly been three long years.</font>

210
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Once this plan succeeds,</font>

211
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I intend to give you all
plenty of the take.</font>

212
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">At dawn tomorrow,</font>

213
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">destroy the village
to your hearts' content!</font>

214
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Eh?! They're going to kill Kaya-san?!}– What?! They're going to kill Miss Kaya?!
– What?! They're going to kill Miss Kaya?!</font>

215
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Are they really going to attack the village?!
– Are they really going to attack the village?!</font>

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, that's what they said.
No question about it.</font>

217
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So what were you
sleeping down here for?</font>

218
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's the thing!</font>

219
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I <i>thought</i> I was up on the cliff...</font>

220
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">{\an8}So how'd I get down here?</font>

221
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I knew it, Klahadore's a bad guy!</font>

222
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No wonder he seems so creepy!</font>

223
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So that's why our captain ran
to the village with that intense look!</font>

224
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's great, then!</font>

225
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now they'll know and can
run away beforehand!</font>

226
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Talk about stupid bad guys!</font>

227
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, that's right!
We gotta run away, too!</font>

228
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, we better grab
all our prized possessions...</font>

229
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– ...and hurry!
– ...and hurry!</font>

230
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh no!</font>

231
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What is it?</font>

232
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We need to stock up on food before
the meat shop guy runs away!</font>

233
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's not the issue at hand here.</font>

234
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp{-san}!</font>

235
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thank goodness!</font>

236
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I thought you might
never come back...</font>

237
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You gotta run, Kaya!
They're gonna kill you!{SV04 @04:09}</font>

238
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Um...</font>

239
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you talking about?</font>

240
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've been tricked!
Your butler is really a pirate!</font>

241
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold on...</font>

242
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What kind of joke is this?</font>

243
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's no joke! I heard it
with my own ears!</font>

244
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Klahadore's really a pirate...</font>

245
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">who weaseled his way into your
mansion so he could get your fortune!</font>

246
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's been pretending to be a butler
for three years straight,</font>

247
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">just so he could rob you!</font>

248
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you talking about, Usopp{-san}?</font>

249
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He said his crew's gonna storm in
and kill you at dawn tomorrow!</font>

250
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I admit, he did say too much earlier.</font>

251
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But lying like this...</font>

252
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's not like you, Usopp{-san}!</font>

253
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, it's not a lie...</font>

254
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the truth...</font>

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the truth!</font>

256
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is something the matter, Miss?!</font>

257
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You gotta escape, Kaya!</font>

258
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let go of her!</font>

259
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just trust me!</font>

260
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You gotta get out of this village...</font>

261
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">before that butler gets back!</font>

262
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop!</font>

263
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Come on!</font>

264
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This'll all make sense come tomorrow!</font>

265
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But you gotta escape for now!{SV04 @04:15}</font>

266
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please, listen to me!</font>

267
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're pathetic.{17:19}</font>

268
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get away from her!</font>

269
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No!</font>

270
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please, catch him!</font>

271
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He roughed up the lady of the house!</font>

272
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– There he is! Get him!
– There he is! Get him!</font>

273
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp{-san}...</font>

274
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please pull yourself together, miss!</font>

275
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Tomorrow morning, Jango.
Attack the village at daybreak!{07:17, 10:10}</i></font>

276
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Captain!
– Captain!</font>

277
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh! Hey, guys!</font>

278
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Hey!
– Hey!</font>

279
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-You're alive?!</font>

280
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alive?</font>

281
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, I just woke up!</font>

282
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This guy was asleep the whole time!</font>

283
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Anyways, Captain!
We heard everything!</font>

284
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's hurry and tell everyone
about the pirates!</font>

285
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Tell everyone?</font>

286
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You're pathetic.{15:44}</i></font>

287
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Shut up! All you ever do
is spout huge lies!{10:00}</i></font>

288
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm lying like usual, obviously!</font>

289
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That damn butler pissed me off,</font>

290
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">so I made up a lie about
him being a pirate!</font>

291
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, I see!</font>

292
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So the straw hat guy is in on it, too!</font>

293
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, what's wrong?</font>

294
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't believe you'd do that, Captain.</font>

295
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Me neither!</font>

296
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Same here!</font>

297
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even if that butler <i>is</i> a jerk,</font>

298
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I never thought you would lie
just to <i>hurt </i>someone!</font>

299
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We really respected you, too!</font>

300
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's go home!</font>

301
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, it's suppertime!</font>

302
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wonder what we're having...</font>

303
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They were never going to
believe me from the start.</font>

304
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was too optimistic.</font>

305
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even so, the truth is the truth.</font>

306
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, they're definitely
gonna show up.</font>

307
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But everyone thinks its a lie.</font>

308
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They think tomorrow will be
just another normal, peaceful day...</font>

309
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's why...</font>

310
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm going to stop the pirates at the beach
tomorrow and make sure this stays a lie!</font>

311
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's the only logical thing
for a liar like me to do!</font>

312
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even if I get shot in the arm...</font>

313
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">or even if I'm driven off with brooms...</font>

314
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">this is my village!</font>

315
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I love this village!</font>

316
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I want to protect everyone!</font>

317
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're one hell of a nice guy,</font>

318
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">pushing your crew away
and going into battle alone!</font>

319
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just so you know, I have dibs
on all the pirates' treasure!</font>

320
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright! We'll help you out!</font>

321
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You guys...</font>

322
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">are going to fight with me?!</font>

323
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why?</font>

324
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's a whole bunch
of bad guys, right?</font>

325
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Scared" is written all over your face.</font>

326
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">M-Me, scared?!</font>

327
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm perfectly okay with
lots of bad guys or whatever!</font>

328
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Because I'm Captain Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea!</font>

329
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit! Dammit!
What're you looking at?!</font>

330
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">These are Klahadore's pirates
we're dealing with!</font>

331
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Of course I'm scared!
What's wrong with that?!</font>

332
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't want your pity!
Stop laughing, and leave! Leave!</font>

333
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We ain't laughing!</font>

334
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're impressed. That's why
we want to help you!</font>

335
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As if we'd risk our lives out of pity!</font>

336
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh...</font>

337
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You guys...</font>
