00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Perfect timing! Do you know how
to get to the execution platform?</font>

126
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Execution platform...?</font>

127
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I got lost on my way to it...</font>

128
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've never seen you
around here before.</font>

129
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! I just arrived on this island!</font>

130
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This town sure is huge! It's way
different from Windmill Village!</font>

131
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So why the execution platform?</font>

132
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I wanna see the place where
the King of the Pirates died!</font>

133
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So you don't know where? Well...</font>

134
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wait. Follow the smoke.</font>

135
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh! That way?! Thanks!</font>

136
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This sucks.</font>

137
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I thought I was headed to the execution
platform, but this can't be the place.</font>

138
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, well. I'll get there sooner or later.</font>

139
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is it this way?</font>

140
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's see...</font>

141
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold... Roger?</font>

142
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you work here, old guy?</font>

143
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It said "Gold Roger"
on the sign outside.</font>

144
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is that this place's name?</font>

145
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Scram.</font>

146
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This ain't a place for a runt like you.</font>

147
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Besides, we're closing for good today.</font>

148
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're going under?</font>

149
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're not going under!
I'm shutting it down myself!</font>

150
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now get lost!</font>

151
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was just curious about the name.</font>

152
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm a little lost.</font>

153
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm trying to get to
the execution platform...</font>

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can you tell me how to get there?</font>

155
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's that on the table?</font>

156
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A skull?! It's huge!</font>

157
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is what became of a guy
who folks called Killer Giant.</font>

158
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's a fiend who sent hundreds
of pirates to the afterlife.</font>

159
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But Gold Roger sent <i>him</i> to
the afterlife with just one blow.</font>

160
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold Roger did?!</font>

161
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">With lightning-like speed!</font>

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is the wound he received!</font>

163
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The man may have lived horribly,</font>

164
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but with his dying breath, he muttered,</font>

165
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Roger... My hat's off to you...</font>

166
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">May you be eternally
honored among pirates."</font>

167
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Awesome! That's so cool!</font>

168
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">When I heard he had conquered
the Grand Line a little later,</font>

169
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Happiness overcame my surprise,
and my excitement belied my age!</font>

170
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And then, twenty-two years ago today,
Roger died on the execution platform.</font>

171
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And since that day, every cocky upstart
has tossed their hat into the pirate ring.</font>

172
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was the beginning
of the Great Pirate Era!</font>

173
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But look what's happened!</font>

174
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This town's full of nothing
but cowards and scum now!</font>

175
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Men crazy enough to challenge
that evil sea are all but gone now!</font>

176
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's why this bar is
closing down for good today.</font>

177
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm going to the Grand Line, too!</font>

178
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?!</font>

179
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold Roger's so cool...</font>

180
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's how a pirate should be!</font>

181
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's why I set out to sea.</font>

182
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna go to the Grand Line,
get the One Piece,</font>

183
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and become King of the Pirates!</font>

184
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Those're some mighty big words!</font>

185
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And in this bar, of all places!</font>

186
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I only said what I meant.</font>

187
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kiddo!</font>

188
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If there're still patrons like you out there,
maybe I'll hold off on closing this place!</font>

189
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How should I know if there are?!</font>

190
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Good point! Of course
you wouldn't know!</font>

191
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I haven't been in this good
a mood since back then...!</font>

192
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll treat you to a drink!</font>

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't drink alcohol.</font>

194
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sure! I have just the thing!</font>

195
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's have a toast!
To the eternal King of the Pirates!</font>

196
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To the eternal King of the Pirates!</font>

197
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Amazing! That's
an elephant bluefin tuna!</font>

198
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right! It probably got
mixed in from the southern ocean.</font>

199
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I caught it with a pole and line!</font>

200
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A pole and line?!</font>

201
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">An elephant bluefin tuna...</font>

202
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay, then, haul it away.</font>

203
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Okay!
– Okay!</font>

204
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hold on a second!</font>

205
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

206
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How much is it?! Let me buy it!</font>

207
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I bought a lot, a heck of a lot!</font>

208
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now my preparations to be a brave
warrior of the sea are complete!</font>

209
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All I've got left is...</font>

210
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, yeah! I forgot the most
important thing. Goggles.</font>

211
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The best goggles for the best marksman!
Does it get anymore basic than that?!</font>

212
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sparing no expense on
the best goggles around</font>

213
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">is the very essence of
being the best marksman!</font>

214
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Goggles! Goggles!</font>

215
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">These ones! These goggles!
They're just perfect!</font>

216
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Ma'am!</font>

217
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've got a good eye! They're
the latest model from the North Blue!</font>

218
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I got 'em from an import vessel that
only leaves the Marines once a year!</font>

219
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's the matter? No money?</font>

220
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I only deal in cash,
so what's it gonna be?</font>

221
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-No, it's... Oh!
Right! My backpack...</font>

222
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll take these goggles, please!</font>

223
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My! What a cute little girl!</font>

224
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, yes, yes, yes! You're in luck!</font>

225
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is the only pair in town!</font>

226
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold it right there!</font>

227
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I saw them first, so–</font>

228
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?</font>

229
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hm?</font>

230
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Butt out, old man!</font>

231
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">O...?!</font>

232
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Old man?</font>

233
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop! Stop right there, you!</font>

234
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Listen! First things first!
There's no way I'm an old man!</font>

235
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm more like a big brother. Got it?</font>

236
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?! What're you
talking about, old man?!</font>

237
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit, you said it again!</font>

238
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just gimme those goggles already!</font>

239
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?!</font>

240
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You got a problem?! Huh?!</font>

241
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Keep up yer damn complainin'
and I'll call the Marines!</font>

242
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">M-Marines?</font>

243
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yep! I'm friends with
a Marine captain in this town!</font>

244
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The old smoky man!</font>

245
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-Who is this girl?</font>

246
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't you know who I am?!</font>

247
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm the great Captain Usopp!
I destroyed Arlong's Fishman Pirates!</font>

248
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was a dire battle! The fishmen had
me surrounded 200—no, 300 to 1!</font>

249
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All alone, I punched, threw, stomped,
kicked, and tore them all up!</font>

250
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks to that, I now have
a 30-million-belly bounty on my head!</font>

251
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I see. 30 million...</font>

252
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yep! That's right!</font>

253
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa!</font>

254
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa?! Now you're calling me Pa–</font>

255
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Ah!</font>

256
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here's a present for you, Papa!</font>

257
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Happy birthday!</font>

258
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, Carol...</font>

259
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:04,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a considerate little angel
you are! I love you, Carol!</font>

260
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I love you, Papa!</font>

261
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What's with this family?</font>

262
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But listen! That asshole old man there
is trying to swipe your present!</font>

263
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now, now! "Asshole" is a bad word.</font>

264
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You should mind your manners, okay?</font>

265
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You wouldn't happen to be picking on
my adorable Carol, would you?</font>

266
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">P-P-Picking on...?</font>

267
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's not all!</font>

268
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?</font>

269
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You have a bounty of
30 million belly, I hear?</font>

270
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's see here...</font>

271
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are those the new wanted posters?</font>

272
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, I got 'em from
the outpost just now...</font>

273
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Six hundred thousand...</font>

274
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One million three hundred thousand...</font>

275
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Seven hundred thousand... Huh?</font>

276
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thirty million... Straw Hat Luffy?</font>

277
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">For a starting bounty to be this high...</font>

278
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold it, boy.</font>

279
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Y-Yes?!</font>

280
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, you see, sir,</font>

281
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm obviously not the person
on that poster! I was just lying!</font>

282
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My silly little prank was
a great success! Well, bye!</font>

283
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's you, isn't it?</font>

284
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-Th-That's right!
It sure is! That's me, all right!</font>

285
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But know this!</font>

286
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you lay a hand on me,
my captain Luffy won't stand for it!</font>

287
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's an evil, cold-blooded,
devilish man!</font>

288
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No one's ever crossed him
and lived to tell the tale.</font>

289
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've got a kid, so you really
ought to value your life more...</font>

290
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I see. It doesn't sound worth it.</font>

291
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:42,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A bounty of 30 million makes it clear
this Luffy fellow is no ordinary man.</font>

292
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa! You're obviously way stronger!</font>

293
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're the strongest in the world!</font>

294
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Carol, it's all right.</font>

295
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As long as I earn enough
to provide for us, I'm happy.</font>

296
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're far more important to me
than being the world's greatest!</font>

297
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa...</font>

298
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's actually backing off
after I said all that!</font>

299
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright! In that case...!</font>

300
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So you realize how terrifying I am?!</font>

301
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Take my advice! Just hand
those goggles over to me!</font>

302
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?!</font>

303
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't worry! I'll pay for 'em!
So just give 'em here!</font>

304
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why the hell would you say that
when he was about to let you–</font>

305
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa?</font>

306
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then let's do this.</font>

307
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I assume you have no problem
with us settling this in a fair fight?</font>

308
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A fight...?</font>

309
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here!</font>

310
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A fight...?! Y-You're not
talking about a duel, are you?!</font>

311
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you win, the goggles are yours.</font>

312
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One, two, three, four,
five, six... <i>thirty</i> pistols?!</font>

313
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">D-Don't tell me you're...</font>

314
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Daddy the Father?!</font>

315
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A duel!</font>

316
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's gonna be a duel!</font>

317
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's a duel with Daddy the Father!</font>

318
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Did he say Daddy the Father?</font>

319
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Daddy the Father is the greatest
gunslinger bounty hunter!</font>

320
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everyone in the East Blue knows that!</font>

321
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So what kind of idiot would
challenge him to a duel?!</font>

322
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, that kind.</font>

323
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Good luck, long nose!</font>

324
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't worry if he beats you!
We've already dug your grave!</font>

325
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-How did things turn out like this?
What's wrong with me?!</font>

326
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The rules are simple. We both
walk ten paces and then shoot.</font>

327
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yeah...</font>

328
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you doing?!</font>

329
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami!</font>

330
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Facing Daddy the Father in
a duel... Have you lost your mind?!</font>

331
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sh-Shut up! It just kinda happened,
so shut up and watch!</font>

332
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You get one shot. Are you ready?</font>

333
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah.</font>

334
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah...</font>

335
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One!</font>

336
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Two!</font>

337
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Three!</font>

338
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Four!</font>

339
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Five!</font>

340
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is bad... Really bad...</font>

341
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no way I can possibly
beat Daddy the Father...</font>

342
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Six!</font>

343
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Am I going to die here?!
This can't be happening!</font>

344
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Seven!</font>

345
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I just started my adventure!</font>

346
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I haven't even gained any courage
or manliness or anything yet!</font>

347
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Eight!</font>

348
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Later!</font>

349
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa!</font>

350
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're amazing, Papa! You're so cool!</font>

351
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Man, how pathetic.</font>

352
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a lame duel.</font>

353
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I thought he'd have more guts
than that. What a disappointment.</font>

354
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who do you think
you are, trying to cheat?!</font>

355
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You cowardly weakling!
Can't you at least fight honestly?!</font>

356
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I'm sorry! Forgive me!
I'm just a lowly, pathetic man!</font>

357
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You'd get nothing out of
killing someone like me!</font>

358
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right?! Right?!</font>

359
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can't you just let me go?</font>

360
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">W-Wait!</font>

361
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nami!</font>

362
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">R-Right! If it's money
you want, she has plenty!</font>

363
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just please don't shoot me!
Please spare my life!</font>

364
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold on, now!</font>

365
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now you're groveling behind a woman?</font>

366
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Anyway–</font>

367
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No! Forget what I just said!</font>

368
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">She's an innocent bystander!</font>

369
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't drag her into this,
even if it means I get shot!</font>

370
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp...</font>

371
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please! I beg you!</font>

372
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Usopp..."</font>

373
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kid, your name is Usopp?</font>

374
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah.</font>

375
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It couldn't be...</font>

376
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you know a man named
Yasopp of the Red Hair Pirates?</font>

377
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yasopp? That's my old man's name.</font>

378
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-You've met my dad before?!</font>

379
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then you <i>are</i> his son...</font>

380
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa?</font>

381
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've never once told a soul
what happened on that day,</font>

382
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but I'll make an exception.</font>

383
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It happened at a hot,
dry port town, much like this one.</font>

384
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="36"><i>Let's do it, Ensign Masterson!
We each get one shot!</i></font>

385
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="36"><i>One! Two! Three!</i></font>

386
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Kill me! Now that I've lost a duel,
I have no reason to live...</font>

387
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you doing?</font>

388
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your daughter?</font>

389
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Give it back...</font>

390
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">An ensign in the Marines, carefully
treasuring something like this...</font>

391
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You must really spoil her.</font>

392
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't lecture me, you filthy pirate!</font>

393
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Fine by me!</font>

394
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You were great, Yasopp!</font>

395
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was nothing.</font>

396
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This wound really shows
off my inexperience.</font>

397
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But you took on Daddy Masterson!</font>

398
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You won because you're you!</font>

399
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, we never would've
stood a chance...</font>

400
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks, Boss!</font>

401
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I appreciate you watching
the duel without saying a thing.</font>

402
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's the stuff!
You want some, Ensign?</font>

403
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Family, huh?</font>

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Family's not so bad.
But I'm no good at it.</font>

405
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?</font>

406
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've got a son of my own.
His name's Usopp.</font>

407
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Haven't seen him in years now.</font>

408
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I hit the high seas around
the time he was a toddler.</font>

409
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why? Do you not love your son?</font>

410
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It wasn't about that.</font>

411
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was about the flag...</font>

412
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I heard the call of the Jolly Roger.</font>

413
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You tell 'im, Yasopp!</font>

414
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now, then...</font>

415
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's nothing I can do for my son.</font>

416
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even one hopeless parent
like me is one too many.</font>

417
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Always stay by your daughter's side.</font>

418
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can't let her feel lonely.</font>

419
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Though I'm in no position to talk!</font>

420
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I lost our duel! Yasopp! Finish me!</font>

421
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't give me your lousy pity!</font>

422
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Forget it!</font>

423
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You Marines might hang us by
our necks the moment you catch us,</font>

424
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but we pirates are free to kill
or spare who we please!</font>

425
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So long!</font>

426
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa! You lost to a pirate,
and he spared your life?!</font>

427
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But that's amazing!
Your dad must be really skilled!</font>

428
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp?</font>

429
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Would you normally...?</font>

430
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Would you normally tell
some pathetic boy like me...</font>

431
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">a shameless story about
having your life spared?!</font>

432
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You told me that to give me courage!</font>

433
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Most people would be too
ashamed to tell a story like that,</font>

434
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but you told me even though
you'd become way less cool!</font>

435
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Regardless of how brave you
showed my old man to be. Right?!</font>

436
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No weakling or coward
could do what you just did!</font>

437
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Carol! Your dad is
the bravest man alive!</font>

438
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can find strong guys anywhere!</font>

439
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But I've never seen a man as
strong and kind as your dad before!</font>

440
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:57,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I... I can't throw in the towel! I gotta
be brave, or I'll shame your dad!</font>

441
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Daddy! Give me a chance!</font>

442
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Face me in another life-or-death duel!</font>

443
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I won't cheat this time!</font>

444
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All right. This will be
our real showdown.</font>

445
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Choose the weapon you're
most comfortable with.</font>

446
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Good. Now, then. Let's see...</font>

447
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Try and hit that weather vane.</font>

448
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That weather vane? Over there?!</font>

449
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Miss it, and...</font>

450
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yeah! You can shoot
me right through the heart!</font>

451
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

452
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My life is on the
line for real this time!</font>

453
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's...</font>

454
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no way he can shoot
that far with that thing...</font>

455
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You missed!</font>

456
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, Papa! Don't shoot him! Papa!</font>

457
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't shoot him. Usopp shot
right through its crown!</font>

458
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He really did!
Right through the crown!</font>

459
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

460
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're an excellent shot.
I'd expect no less of Yasopp's son.</font>

461
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Never forget that bravery.</font>

462
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You'll be just like your
old man someday!</font>

463
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go to the Grand Line.
I'm certain Yasopp is there.</font>

464
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Daddy...</font>

465
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're pretty good, old man!</font>

466
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Aren't these...?</font>

467
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's okay! See ya!</font>

468
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Papa!</font>

469
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Carol, you should know better.</font>

470
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's bad manners to say, "See ya!"</font>

471
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Right! Sorry, Papa!</font>

472
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm going to grow up to be a proper
lady worthy of being your daughter!</font>

473
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So will you forgive me?</font>

474
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're already about as
proper as they come!</font>

475
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll be even more proper!</font>

476
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even if people consider him a disgrace,</font>

477
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">he's only ever fought to
protect the one he loves.</font>

478
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm going to be
a brave man like Daddy!</font>

479
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna become a real warrior
and stand before my dad someday!</font>

480
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I know it!</font>

481
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You?!</font>

482
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's quite the warm weclome...</font>

483
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and I'm a regular, too.</font>

484
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm not the one you
should be angry with.</font>

485
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I only come here as a loyal customer.</font>

486
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the pirates' fault that
they're all cowards these days.</font>

487
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You had a customer? That's rare.</font>

488
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'd like some rum.</font>

489
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's no booze here for you!</font>

490
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be so cold-hearted.</font>

491
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Today's a special day.</font>

492
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wouldn't you agree?</font>

493
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's the stuff...</font>

494
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can still see it like it was yesterday...</font>

495
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How Roger looked at the very end...</font>

496
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was a humid afternoon,
just like today...</font>

497
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hands shackled, he was led down
the main street toward the plaza</font>

498
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">where the execution platform stood.</font>

499
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yet, he marched down it
like a triumphant general.</font>

500
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wealth, fame, power...</font>

501
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold Roger obtained everything
the world had to offer.</font>

502
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even though he was
walking toward death,</font>

503
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">he was the embodiment
of a pride-filled king...</font>

504
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Inherited will...</font>

505
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the tides of time,
and humanity's dreams...</font>

506
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As long as people seek freedom,</font>

507
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">these things will never cease to be.</font>

508
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you have any last words?!</font>

509
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you mind removing these?
They itch like you wouldn't believe.</font>

510
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't do that!</font>

511
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You think I would run?</font>

512
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Guess I'm on my own.</font>

513
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All right, let's get this over with.</font>

514
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Pirate King!</font>

515
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where did you hide
all the treasure you found?!</font>

516
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is it in the Grand Line?!</font>

517
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You found it, didn't you?!
That legendary treasure!</font>

518
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shut up, you!</font>

519
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That great treasure!</font>

520
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The One Piece!</font>

521
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My treasure?</font>

522
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who said you could speak?!</font>

523
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's yours, if you can find it!</font>

524
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Everything is right where I left it!</font>

525
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Execute!</font>

526
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's how it all began...</font>

527
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey!</font>

528
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A new wanted poster!
Put it up somewhere noticeable!</font>

529
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">C-Captain Smoker!
Pardon the intrusion, sir!</font>

530
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">U-Umm...</font>

531
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That straw hat...</font>

532
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It <i>was</i> Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

533
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There it is...</font>

534
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The place where the
greatest pirate in history died...</font>

535
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The place where it all began...</font>
