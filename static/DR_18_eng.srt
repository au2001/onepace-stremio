29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a shocking conclusion!</font>

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There were roughly twenty competitors still fighting,</font>

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they've all been knocked out mysteriously!</font>

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in the center of the ring,</font>

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see the shadow of someone getting up!</font>

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the winner?!</font>

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the fighter who did this?!</font>

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-</font>

38
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,460

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fourth finalist in the Corrida Colosseum's battle tournament is...</font>

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the descendant of Dressrosa's shameful King Riku, the prisoner gladiator...</font>

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca!</font>

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get real!</font>

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of trick did you pull, Rebecca?!</font>

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Investigate her!</font>

49
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, Rebecca!</font>

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who cares how she did it?</font>

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The point is, Rebecca's won!</font>

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is this?! What did that wench do to Cavendish-sama?!</font>

54

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slicing Wind?</font>

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Slicing Wind of Rommel.</font>

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wouldn't know...</font>

58
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">about the mysterious tragedy that once befell the kingdom of Rommel.</font>

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say the wind started slashing up people once the night fell.</font>

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy was dispatched immediately, but...</font>

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">quite a few marines were felled by that wind, as well.</font>

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end, the only thing they learned...</font>

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was that the wind was actually a man calling himself Hakuba.</font>

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still haven't managed to capture him.</font>

65
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after leaving the Rommel Kingdom, Hakuba has continued causing trouble in other places.</font>

66
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wherever Hakuba appears, a 
certain pirate is always there.</font>

67
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

68
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Do you think you can escape me, girl?!</i></font>

69
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Get out of my way!</i></font>

70
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something strange about him.</font>

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He fell asleep?! </font>

72
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sleepwalking?</font>

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hakuba is in fact an alternate personality that only appears when Cavendish is sleeping.</font>

75
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of the crimes Hakuba has committed,</font>

76
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cavendish was driven out to sea and became a pirate.</font>

77
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's rather unfortunate, then.</font>

78
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not worth pitying!</font>

79
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cavendish enjoys his situation.</font>

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop to pity him, and he'll just attack you while your guard's down.</font>

81
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He already was an expert swordsman,</font>

82
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but Hakuba is twice as strong.</font>

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, the fact that he falls asleep whenever his other personality emerges...</font>

84
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has made him ill-suited for this battle royale.</font>

85
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way Rebecca could win!</font>

86
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must have used a pistol or something!</font>

87
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She won without cutting down a single opponent.</font>

88
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a respectable fighting style.</font>

89
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, she was the only one who saw Hakuba's sword coming.</font>

90
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't just chalk that up to dumb luck.</font>

91
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regardless of her circumstances,</font>

92
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let her have the Flame Fruit.</font>

93
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've really kept me waiting! Now I finally get to fight!</font>

94
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,460
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa Royal Palace</font>

95
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see that?</font>

96
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your granddaughter sure is lucky.</font>

97
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, I can't believe both you and your granddaughter competed,</font>

98
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku.</font>

99
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a former king to seek a Devil Fruit, you must really feel driven into a corner.</font>

100
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca...</font>

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I must say, your family sure is causing me no end of trouble today.</font>

102
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Violet betrayed me.</font>

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there some sort of anniversary today?</font>

104
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems you don't realize...</font>

105
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what your actions this morning meant to us.</font>

106
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Regarding the worldwide announcement of Doflamingo
 renouncing his throne and title as a Warlord...</i></font>

107
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It was a mistake.</i></font>

108
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The information was incorrect.</i></font>

109
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I simply had to fight back.</font>

110
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's all.</font>

111
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. So that's why you took action.</font>

112
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that doesn't explain Viola.</font>

113
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unlike you, she is cunning.</font>

114
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She would never let her emotions get the better of her.</font>

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must have made a wager.</font>

116
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The promising newcomer who dared to defy me...</font>

117
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Warlord, Trafalgar Law.</font>

118
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the man from that powerful bloodline, who caused such a stir two years ago...</font>

119
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey D. Luffy.</font>

120
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman hopes their pirate alliance will be enough to bring me down.</font>

121
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Law is already out of commission,</font>

122
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and when Straw Hat Luffy leaves the Colosseum, he will no longer be human.</font>

123
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for the other Straw Hats...</font>

124
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hear that Cyborg Franky is attacking the Toys' House on his own.</font>

125
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It remains to be seen if he can beat my commanders.</font>

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other pieces in play would be...</font>

127
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate Hunter Zoro, Foxfire Kin'emon, Nico Robin and Sogeking.</font>

128
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they won't even make it to the underground.</font>

129
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know left from right down here, so let's start from the right, please.</font>

130
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,670
<font face="impress bt" size="45">At the Foot of the Royal Grounds</font>

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The lift is up ahead.</font>

132
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,310
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Luffy</font>

133
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,310
<font face="impress bt" size="45">in Carp</font>

134
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,940
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Zoro</font>

135
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,940
<font face="impress bt" size="45">in Cat</font>

136
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,460
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Kin'emon</font>

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,460
<font face="impress bt" size="45">in Frog</font>

138
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, all of you.</font>

139
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The royal palace, where Doflamingo is,</font>

140
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Toys' House,</font>

141
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the trade port where the Smile factory is, are all connected.</font>

142
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if we go into the royal palace, we can also reach the Toys' House and the factory?</font>

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Exactly!</font>

144
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to go to the factory, you'd normally have to go through either the palace or the Toys' House,</font>

145
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but my allies should have gotten in via a secret passage they've been digging.</font>

146
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should head for the royal palace first.</font>

147
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well, I understand.</font>

148
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I must say, even seeing one right in front of me,</font>

149
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hardly believe that such small people could exist.</font>

150
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, she's like a toy! It's so cool!</font>

151
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Normally, we're not supposed to show ourselves to any big humans outside the royal family.</font>

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You Straw Hat Pirates, aka Usolanders, are the only exception!</font>

153
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usolanders?</font>

154
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Operation SOP is already in motion.</font>

155
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, there it is!</font>

156
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The lift that leads up to the royal palace entrance.</font>

157
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll have to show the guards a pass if you want to ride the lift...</font>

158
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem. I'll just beat 'em up.</font>

159
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't!</font>

160
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do that, you'll cause a commotion and attract more enemies!</font>

161
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's somebody there.</font>

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?</font>

163
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy, I take it?</font>

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yup, that's me.</font>

165
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't answer!</i></font>

166
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been waiting for you.</font>

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take you inside the palace.</font>

168
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now all that's left is the final!</font>

169
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The four commanders who were meant to participate in the finals are unfortunately unable to do so. </font>

171
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you needn't worry!</font>

172
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because our Colosseum's hero...</font>

173
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mr. Diamante...</font>

174
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has been selected to fight in their stead!</font>

175
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diamante!</font>

176
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diamante-sama!</font>

177
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the medical room!</font>

178
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

179
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

180
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in the finals too!</font>

181
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy?</font>

182
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not him.</font>

183
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you!</font>

184
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show some respect, this man is...</font>

185
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Rebecca, right?</font>

186
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know what you've been through.</font>

187
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things might get chaotic out there, but I won't harm you.</font>

188
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you look past the outward appearance...</font>

189
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this country somehow...</font>

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">reminds me of the one where the three of us grew up.</font>

191
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,830
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Royal Grounds</font>

192
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have the entry permits.</font>

193
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,730
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Lift Leading to the Palace Gates</font>

194
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This lift can take you to the palace gates,</font>

195
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if you're discovered, it's all over.</font>

196
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And most importantly...</font>

197
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most importantly?</font>

198
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're far too suspicious.</font>

199
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That, I did not account for!</font>

200
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you the woman our cook went off with earlier? </font>

201
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?</font>

202
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Black Leg.</i></font>

203
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My precious Violet-chan!</i></font>

204
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went off to save your ship, and then...</font>

205
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know the rest.</font>

206
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you tell him that the Sunny was in danger?</font>

207
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And could it be that you gave Sanji-dono the map to the Toys' House that he passed on to me?</font>

208
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, that was me.</font>

209
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you do such a thing?</font>

210
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was one of Doflamingo's subordinates.</font>

211
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Mingo's?!</font>

212
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's pretending to work for Doflamingo!</font>

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wicca!</font>

214
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You remember me?</font>

215
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you forget about my powers? </font>

216
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been watching you the whole time.</font>

217
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that you've teamed up with the one-legged soldier who raised Rebecca after my sister died,</font>

218
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and that you're about to start fighting back.</font>

219
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw it all! </font>

220
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for believing in my father.</font>

221
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Viola-sama!</font>

222
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

223
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the king's daughter?!</font>

224
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's in the past.</font>

225
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if Rebecca is the king's granddaughter...</font>

226
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're her mom?!</font>

227
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca is my niece.</font>

228
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's my sister Scarlett's daughter.</font>

229
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could this be...</font>

230
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A hidden door?</font>

231
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were a ninja all along?!</font>

232
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an emergency passage known only to the Riku Royal Family.</font>

233
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not even Doflamingo knows about this place.</font>

234
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What might this giant basket be?</font>

235
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pulley to carry items. Look.</font>

236
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is really tall.</font>

237
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are stairs as well.</font>

238
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These stairs will take you to the Rampart Tower, where the palace gates are.</font>

239
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy. You should take this stone and go to the top.</font>

240
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that is an inspired idea.</font>

241
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can grab the chain at the top and come down with it, and we will get up quickly.</font>

242
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's crazy.</font>

243
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

244
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm off!</font>

245
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry, Luffy!</font>

246
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get on board, ninja-woman.</font>

247
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

248
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,520
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Toys' House</font>

249
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a pain!</font>

250
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky...</font>

251
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rocket...</font>

252
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shoulder...</font>

253
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Launcher!</font>

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

255
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's too dangerous!</font>

256
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that pistol on his head is just for show after all!</font>

257
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor! Run!</font>

258
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use your power to dive into the ground!</font>

259
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to be brushing your teeth with a shoe brush!</font>

260
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?</i></font>

261
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't... </font>

262
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's too hard-boiled!</font>

263
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor!</font>

264
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is horrible!</font>

265
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Senor Pink!</i></font>

266
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Senor!</i></font>

267
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't he use his power to escape?</font>

268
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,550

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">swim when I want to.</font>

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Brandy?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's covered in blood, and I'm sure his bones are broken, yet...</font>

276
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's disinfecting his wounds with brandy!</font>

277
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not it!</font>

278
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor, the reason you risked your life to take that attack face-on...</font>

279
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was because you've got an immobilized ally lying behind you, right?!</font>

280
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My stomach hurts -<i>in.</i></font>

281
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor!</font>

282
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart feels like it's gonna burst!</font>

283
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was so long ago. I don't even remember.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Vise, can you stand?</font>

286
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fine -<i>in</i>!</font>

287
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy is so hard-boiled.</font>

288
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,680

294
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it right there!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy has got the Toys' House completely surrounded!</font>

297
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the Navy doing here?</font>

298
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Didn't you know -<i>in</i>?</font>

299
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another noisy bunch.</font>

300
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,130
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Royal Palace</font>

301
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy has made their move. </font>

302
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You made the right decision, Fujitora.</font>

303
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,950
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Suit
Chamber</font>

304
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like I'm on your side.</font>

305
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Straw Hats, as well as several other suspicious individuals, are on the move...</font>

306
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it is only natural for me to take action.</font>

307
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My men should fight in order to keep civilian casualties to a minimum.</font>

308
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw Hat is truly after your head, he would probably cause major damage.</font>

309
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:53,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, stopping him is my justice.</font>

310
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for you... I'll deal with you later.</font>

311
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

312
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may be a newcomer who was conscripted into the Navy,</font>

313
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there are things I want to do, now that I have the rank of Admiral.</font>

314
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To completely eliminate the system of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea.</font>

315
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There once was an incident when a certain pirate attempted to take over a country. </font>

316
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Had he succeeded, I'm sure that land would have become as shady as this one.</font>

317
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the balance between the three great powers?</font>

318
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows? There's no way to tell without actually shattering it.</font>

319
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So...</font>

320
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't behave...</font>

321
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">your head will fly, Sir Heavenly Demon.</font>

322
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel like you're telling me to kill you while I have the chance.</font>

323
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be hasty. Let's try to play nice for now.</font>

324
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm saying I'll protect your kingdom.</font>

325
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever filth may be exposed in this country in the near future...</font>

326
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't be able to see it, so you needn't worry.</font>

327
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the year the World Council Meeting Reverie will be held. </font>

328
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For better or worse, the world will change.</font>

329
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for the Corrida Colosseum battle tournament's...</font>

330
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">final round!</font>

331
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I made it!</font>

332
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entire country's eyes will be on this match! The special arena has been prepared!</font>

333
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we all wait for the five contestants to enter the arena!</font>

334
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where the fun begins.</font>

335
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Let's go, Marincolosseo!</font>

336
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Bartolomeo! Where'd you even get that name from?</font>

337
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, the first one to enter is...</font>

338
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's him!</font>

339
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rising star of this tournament, our very own Lucy, has arrived!</font>

340
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch me, Ace!</font>
