<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you go?!</font>

00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so hot in here!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-</font>?  Sh-?

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's just my type! </font>

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Healthy, young and a flawless beauty!</font>

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But wait... What?</font>

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to that Okama who beat up all the guards?</font>

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What are you...</font>

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That doesn't matter, does it, big guy?</font>

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come over here for a sec...</font>

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sweaty, my shirt's stuck to my skin...</font>

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you help me take this off?</font>

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on...</font>

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well now, d'you mind opening the door for me?</font>

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, of course!</font>

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There we go!</font>

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay then, let me give you a hand with that...</font>

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got a change of clothes with you?</font>

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fooled you!</font>

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unforgivable...</font>

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What that Okama did was unforgivable!</font>

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd be happy to blame the Warden for this, but I can't stand being outwitted!</font>

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, I wanna be Warden...</font>

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used too much poison...</font>

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My stomach is...! </font>

32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yea, we've finally stopped all the commotion.</font>

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've put all the prisoners back in their cages, and we've retrieved the stolen keys, but...</font>

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there are quite a few missing.</font>

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really troublesome.</font>

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could you possibly...</font>

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">not find him?!</font>

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and bring him to me, alive!</font>

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Okama-prisoner is, without a doubt...</font>

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">on this floor!</font>

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, ma'am!</font>

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And then, as more time passes by,
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei finds himself...</i></font>

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so you're finally awake, bro!</font>

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been sleeping for quite a while, huh?  Want a drink?</font>

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers for the Newkama!</font>

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers!</font>

47
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We saw all of it on the monitors.</font>

48
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That uprising of yours was really something to see!</font>

49
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this place?</font>

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me take you to your seat.</font>

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What floor did you come from?</font>

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got plenty of food here!</font>

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be starving.</font>

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this place?  Where's Straw-chan?!</font>

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think you've escaped to the outside world?</font>

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.</font>

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're still in Impel Down.</font>

58
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like hell we are!</font>

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody's wearing a prison jumpsuit.</font>

60
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's eating delicious food and drinking booze...</font>

61
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this some sort of paradise?!</font>

62
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  I...</font>

63
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was chased by the wolves, and saved by Straw-chan's mysterious power,</font>

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and then I lost consciousness.</font>

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, is this a dream?</font>

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, wait!  I must have frozen to death!</font>

67
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the afterlife?</font>

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're awake?</font>

69
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure slept for a long time.</font>

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must have been at least 10 hours.</font>

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">10 hours?!</font>

72
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you talking about?</font>

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Inazuma.</font>

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so rude.</font>

76
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the one who carried the two of you here when you were on the verge of freezing to death.</font>

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two of us, you said...</font>

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean Straw-chan is here too?</font>

79
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is he?  Is he safe?!</font>

80
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys prison staff?</font>

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where... Where is this place??</font>

82
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, calm down.</font>

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That person will tell you everything you need to know.</font>

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"That person"...?</font>

85
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The lights are down!</font>

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The show's starting!</font>

87
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us go up to the front.</font>

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did vyou sleep well, Candy-boy?</font>

89
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or rather, Mr. 2 Bon-boy?</font>

90
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  How do you know my name?</font>

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm impressed that vyou made it here.</font>

92
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

93
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good going!  You're super sexy!</font>

94
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A place that vyou'll reach by taking...</font>

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A path that shouldn't exist through the sewers of Impel Down.</font>

97
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A prisoners' paradise!</font>

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's all sorts of entertainment down here!</font>

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liquor...</font>

100
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons...</font>

101
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Games...</font>

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And above all else, FREEDOM!</font>

103
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">YEAH!  THAT'S RIGHT!  WE'RE ALL FREE!</font>

104
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

105
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guards were making a fuss today.</font>

106
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Saying "The prisoners have been dragged into the underworld", vyou know?</font>

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's too bad!  Vwe're all down here!</font>

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great going!</font>

109
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay!</font>

110
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ain't the underworld...</font>

111
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's more like the Okama-world!</font>

112
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hidden society known to no one!</font>

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi welcome you...</font>

114
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to Impel Down Level 5.5!
The secret hideout of the prisoners...</font>

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,240

116
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this army of perverts?</font>

117
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-sama!</font>

118
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-san?!</font>

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The tension in here is a bit too much...</font>

120
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm gonna... Collapse...</font>

121
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-sama, are you alright?</font>

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm gonna... Vi'm gonna...</font>

123
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm gonna be JUST FINE!</font>

124
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were just kidding?!</font>

125
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got me there!</font>

126
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really Iva-san?</font>

127
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, so vyou know who Vi am?</font>

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Why are you calling him "Iva-san" so casually!?</font>

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yea!  It's Iva-sama, King of Newkama!</font>

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-sama!  Iva-sama!</font>

131
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be silent, Candies!</font>

132
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a name.  No need to get so worked up over it.</font>

133
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How vyou address vme is of no concern.</font>

134
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People can talk to me however they want. They can even call me "Poo"!</font>

135
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they better not!</font>

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't call you poo?!</font>

137
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got me there!</font>

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This person is the "Miracle-worker"?</font>

139
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one I've always looked up to?!</font>

140
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Ivankov!</font>

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hear you're the Queen of the Drag Queendom!</font>

142
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dad was a king fifteen years ago,</font>

143
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">until he set foot in Kamabakka...</font>

144
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and came back as an okama!</font>

145
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because the king was an Okama, our pride and royalty were lost!</font>

146
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I turned from a prince into a pirate!</font>

147
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never expected to get my revenge in here!</font>

148
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna pay for ruining my life!</font>

149
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-S-Stop it, please!</font>

150
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a dangerous weapon!</font>

151
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dangerous!  Vi'm telling you, it's too dangerous!</font>

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'll die!  Vi'll die!</font>

153
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou hit me, Vi... Vi...</font>

154
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Won't die!</font>

155
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't die?</font>

156
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got me that time!</font>

157
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death Wink!</font>

158
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is!  Iva-sama's simple flutter of an eye, the Death Wink!</font>

159
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He repelled the cannonball with just a wink?!</font>

160
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Female Hormone!</font>

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you...?!</font>

162
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... It can't be...?!</font>

163
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So vyour father wanted to become a woman.</font>

164
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with that?</font>

165
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-S-Stop it!</font>

166
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It-t-t...  It's shrinking! </font>

167
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two mothers and one daughter.</font>

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't that sound lovely?</font>

169
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi hope vyou'll get along.</font>

170
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nooo!  No, stop it!</font>

171
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

172
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man, a woman...</font>

173
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or an Okama...</font>

174
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou should just be what vyou want to be, right?!</font>

175
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gender doesn't matter here!</font>

176
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi, no, vwe are a new race, who do not care about such petty things!</font>

177
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Newkama!</font>

178
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the garden of freedom, Newkama Land!</font>

179
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-sama!</font>

180
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He turned a man into a woman!</font>

181
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He really is a miracle-worker!</font>

182
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome, to vmy Newkama Land!</font>

183
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's too embarassing!</font>

184
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Overwhelmed with shame...</font>

185
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi suppose vyou still have a long way to go before becoming a Newkama, then.</font>

186
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Miracle-worker, Emporio Ivankov!</font>

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an honor to meet you!</font>

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad to meet you!  Really!</font>

189
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive my insolence, but I have a favor to ask!</font>

190
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A favor?</font>

191
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My friend was poisoned by Magellan, and I want you to save his life!</font>

192
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's long past being curable, and his death is quickly approaching!</font>

193
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do anything for you if you'll just save him!</font>

194
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are vyou talking about Straw-Hat-boy?</font>

195
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-Boy?</font>

196
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do vyou know why Vi treated vyour injuries?</font>

197
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that you mention it...</font>

198
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe're prisoners.</font>

199
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe're not so kind as to heal every wounded person we come across.</font>

200
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because that Straw-Hat-boy vyou mentioned begged that vyour life be spared.</font>

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan did?!</font>

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan...</font>

203
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">tried to save me...</font>

204
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was attacked by the wolves!</font>

205
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please... Help him...!</font>

206
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please...!</font>

207
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's... my friend...!</font>

208
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most people'd never say that sort of thing so close to death themselves.</font>

209
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems the flower of friendship can bloom even here, in the prison.</font>

210
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Vi had ignored that request, Vi'd be no better than a demon.</font>

211
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan!</font>

212
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy's treatment has been going for ten hours now.</font>

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

214
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an excruciating process, though.</font>

215
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on in there?!</font>

216
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You call this treatment?!</font>

217
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vhe's been locked inside the cave for the past ten hours, screaming all the while.</font>

218
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll take another two days before vhis treatment ends.</font>

219
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

220
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years of vyour life.</font>

221
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi will be cutting ten years off vyour lifespan, Straw Hat-boy.</font>

222
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay...</font>

223
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, even using those ten years, Vi cannot guarantee that vyou'll survive.</font>

224
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:53,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will only increase vyour odds from zero to two or three percent.</font>

225
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether or not it's possible for vyou to survive...</font>

226
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">depends entirely on vyour own will to live.</font>

227
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou die, the poison wins.</font>

228
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou escape with vyour life, you win!</font>

229
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a nice journey to the brink of death!</font>

230
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Healing Hormone!</font>

231
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Ten hours?!</font>

232
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been screaming out in pain like this, for the past ten hours, Straw-chan?!</font>

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spirit and hormones.</font>

234
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These make up a body's vital forces.</font>

235
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi have pushed the power of Straw-Hat boy's immune system beyond the normal limit,</font>

236
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to rebuild his body into one able to withstand the poison.</font>

237
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His insides are currently breaking down and rebuilding themselves rapidly, over and over again.</font>

238
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If his pained screaming stops, it will mean the treatment has claimed his life.</font>

239
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou're worried, vyou can go have a look at him.</font>

240
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Where is it... Where?</font>

241
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-ch-?</font>

242
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He's gonna die!</font>

243
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His body is all battered...</font>

244
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gon' break him... And tear him...</font>

245
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's al'eady dead!  I'th horri'le!</font>

246
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help him!  Please, save Straw-chan!</font>

247
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remove the chains and stop his bleeding!</font>

248
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please do something... Anything...!</font>

249
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you!</font>

250
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

251
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm already trying to save him!</font>

252
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't vyou underestimate life!</font>

253
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do vyou understand what it means to fight against death when already destined to die?!</font>

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi am no God or Buddha.</font>

255
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A miracle-worker?</font>

256
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou can call vme whatever vyou want, but...</font>

257
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi've never saved anyone foolish enough to depend on someone else for everything.</font>

258
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even those countries on the verge of destruction, lacking the strength to survive...</font>

259
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All Vi did was ask if they had the will to live.</font>

260
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Miracles only occur for those with the determination to never stop trying!</font>

261
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never underestimate the power of miracles!</font>

262
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So in short, Vi ate the Hormone Fruit.  Vi'm a hormone-altering man.</font>

263
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gender, body temperature, pigmentation, growth, and excitement.</font>

264
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm an engineer of the human body who can alter people from the inside.</font>

265
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou have the scent of a Newkama, but...</font>

266
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Candies here have overcome the barriers of gender.</font>

267
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The men may have been women,</font>

268
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...or for all vyou know, the women were once men.</font>

269
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a miracle.</font>

270
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, an unbelievable miracle!</font>

271
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it!</font>

272
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You used those hormones earlier to turn that man into a woman.</font>

273
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, look at this place.</font>

274
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just can't believe it's a prison!</font>

275
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This has got to be a dream!</font>

276
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no dream!  It's the land of dreams!</font>

277
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the Candies here were lost prisoners.</font>

278
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They all came here by pure luck.</font>

279
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are entrances to Newkama Land on every floor.</font>

280
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the forest of blood-stained needles...</font>

281
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in the den of the beasts...</font>

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in the scorching hellfire...</font>

283
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and among the piles of corpses.</font>

284
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe can get all vwe need by taking those routes.</font>

285
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The jailers haven't noticed a thing.</font>

286
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, who'd think such a paradise could be hidden in Hell?</font>

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All information from the outside world is available to vus.</font>

288
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:10,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe have a Snail Monitor down here, just like the ones in the monitor rooms.</font>

289
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe know everything that goes on in the prison that way.</font>

290
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And vwe snatch newspapers from the trash cans, so vwe're all up to date on the outside world.</font>

291
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyour little uproar led by Straw-Hat-boy, the first intruder in this prison's history,</font>

292
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was a lot of fun to watch.</font>

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was really fascinating.</font>

294
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we, anyway?</font>

295
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this huge space even exist?</font>

296
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't here at first.</font>

297
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long ago, there was a prisoner who'd eaten a burrowing Devil Fruit.</font>

298
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi hear that this Candy was the first to start working on this prisoners' paradise.</font>

299
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is like an anthill carved into an enormous rock.</font>

300
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou want to know which floor it is, it's right between Level 5 and 6.</font>

301
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second!  Level 6?!</font>

302
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That floor exists?!</font>

303
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, though most people don't know it,</font>

304
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it does exist.</font>

305
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's where the <i>truly</i> dangerous prisoners are kept.</font>

306
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who are sentenced to life or condemned to death.</font>

307
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level 6, Eternal Hell.</font>

308
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The brutality of these prisoners forces the government to conceal its very existence.</font>

309
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then again, they hide anything that's inconvenient for them.</font>

310
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For instance, vyou guys tore through the prison all the way down to Level 4,</font>

311
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if vyou had come a bit sooner, Vi don't think vyou'd have made it as far.</font>

312
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because there used to be another great power in this prison.</font>

313
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Head Jailer of Impel Down, Shiryuu of the Rain.</font>

314
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His power equaled that of Warden Magellan,</font>

315
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and considering Magellan's relative lack of experience, Shiryuu may have been even more deadly.</font>

316
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-More deadly than Magellan!?</font>

317
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impel Down prided itself in being
impenetrable because of those two.</font>

318
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Head Jailer...</font>

319
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shiryuu of the Rain?!</font>

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shiryuu!  What are you doing?!</i></font>

321
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaddaya mean "What"?</i></font>

322
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The prisoners aren't here for your entertainment, Shiryuu!</i></font>

323
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who's going to complain if I clean up
a little human trash?</i></font>

324
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't overlook your behavior any longer.</i></font>

325
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If word of your actions were to leak outside,</i></font>

326
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>it would stain Impel Down's reputation!</i></font>

327
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>By my authority as Warden, I hereby place you under arrest!</i></font>

328
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He slaughtered so many prisoners on mere whim...</font>

329
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that he was deemed a threat and is now restrained on Level 6.</font>

330
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never heard anything about that!</font>

331
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it happened before I was put in here...</font>

332
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The most fearsome woman in the history of piracy, Katarina Devon,</font>

333
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Giant Battleship, San Juan Wolf,</font>

334
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the Great Drinker, Basco Shot...</font>

335
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of them, pirates whose names send shivers down the spine...</font>

336
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But their most brutal crimes never made it into the newspapers.</font>

337
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are the kind of legendary pirates who are imprisoned on Level 6!</font>

338
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyour old boss is there too.</font>

339
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was quite insane himself.</font>

340
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Zero-chan?  Crocodile?!</font>

341
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy and vyour organization were enemies in Alabasta, weren't vyou?</font>

342
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite a curious relationship you have.</font>

343
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Allegiances mean <i>nothing</i> in a friendship!</font>

344
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true.</font>

345
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's also Jinbei, Knight of the Sea and one of the Seven Warlords.</font>

346
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then there's the one that Straw-Hat-boy is trying to save, right?</font>

347
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain of the Whitebeard Pirates' Second Division, Portgas D. Ace.</font>

348
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi heard through the prison communications that they're apparently brothers.</font>

349
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  Straw-chan came all the way down here to rescue that guy.</font>

350
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just getting to the prison and breaking in was practically an act of God.</font>

351
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now, he's gonna have to give up on all that.</font>

352
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His own life must come first, after all.</font>

353
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's past midnight now,</font>

354
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so Ace-boy will be executed today, at 3 in the afternoon.</font>

355
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi assume he'll be taken to Navy HQ in the morning...</font>

356
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In another, let's see,</font>

357
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">7 or 8 hours, Ace-boy will be taken out of Impel Down.</font>

358
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy's treatment will still take another two days.</font>

359
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he manages to survive, it'll take vhim another three days of sleep to recover his strength.</font>

360
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the time he wakes up, it'll all be over.</font>

361
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, will Straw-chan even be able to survive two days in his state?!</font>

362
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They normally don't survive.  It's a miracle if they do, didn't Vi tell vyou?</font>

363
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou need to rest, too.</font>

364
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get something to eat and go to sleep.</font>

365
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'll take vyou to a quiet room.</font>

366
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be outside Straw-chan's room!</font>

367
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, drop it!  He's...</font>

368
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think he's got much of a chance.</font>

369
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What can you possibly do?</font>

370
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what he's doing...</font>

371
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing to do but wait...</font>

372
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HANG IN THERE!</font>

373
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HANG IN THERE, STRAW-CHAN!</font>

374
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HANG IN THERE!</font>

375
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-HANG IN THERE!</font>

376
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HANG IN THERE!</font>

377
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been doing that this whole time?</font>

378
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Hang in there!</font>

379
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an idiot. That won't help at all.</font>

380
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why aren't you able to find...</font>

381
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">one single Okama?!</font>

382
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Search the place one more time!</font>

383
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hang in there!</font>

384
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

385
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Straw-chan!</font>

386
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan!  Live!</font>

387
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

388
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

389
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Straw-chan!</font>

390
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden!</font>

391
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just received a message from the Level 5 kitchen staff!</font>

392
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

393
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...has disappeared!</font>

394
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

395
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Assistant Warden Hannyabal!</font>

396
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing here?!</font>

397
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

398
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Straw-chan!</font>

399
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-san...</font>

400
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know anything about that woman, but...</font>

401
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wouldn't it be better to just assume she was lying?</font>

402
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're saying she came all the way down here just to lie to me?!</font>

403
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, sorry...</font>

404
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you know, Jinbei...</font>

405
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just the kind of brother he is...</font>

406
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just keeps doing these reckless things!</font>

407
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been making me worry about him ever since we were kids, that idiot!</font>

408
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's... It's blood!</font>

409
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His voice...</font>

410
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way he'd stop screaming during his treatment.</font>

411
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he falls silent before the end...</font>

412
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a shame!</font>

413
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, vyou fought well for 20 hours.</font>

414
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan!</font>

415
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Food!</font>

416
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Straw-chan!</font>

417
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

418
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way!</font>

419
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

420
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hasn't even been a day yet!</font>

421
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden.  Warden Magellan!</font>

422
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good morning.</font>

423
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got diarrhea.</font>

424
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then hurry up.</font>

425
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for Portgas D. Ace to be taken to his execution.</font>

426
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring the food!  Quickly!</font>

427
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter if it's raw, just get as much as possible!</font>

428
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!  Place it by the door!</font>

429
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing... He's sucking it in like an antlion pit!</font>

430
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long is he gonna keep eating?</font>

431
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been going like this for 30 minutes!</font>

432
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's eaten several days of Kama Land's food supply...</font>

433
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's quite the impressive vitality!</font>

434
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's coming out!</font>

435
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that creature?</font>

436
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing's not human!</font>

437
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'M...</i></font>

438
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,520
