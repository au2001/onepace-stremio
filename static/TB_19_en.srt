<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing, Straw Hat!</font>

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You defeated Oars!</font>

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We pushed him this far... Is he gonna be alright?</font>

36
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be completely worn out.</font>

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was using the strength of 100 men in a single body.</font>

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, we gotta recover the shadows of all the victims quickly!</font>

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

40
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry!</font>

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sky is getting brighter in the east.</font>

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be morning any time now.</font>

43
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, how do you get the shadows back?</font>

44
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">4 of our friends were stripped off their shadows too.</font>

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's another problem.</font>

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To tell you the truth, we wanted
Straw Hat to do that for us, but...</font>

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd be impossible, he can't even move right now.</font>

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only Moriah, the master of all the shadows the zombies possess, is able to do that.</font>

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unless he gives the "go back to your original master" order, the shadows won't return.</font>

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's quit the chit-chat and do it.</font>

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll wake Moriah and force him to give the order.</font>

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't recover the shadows, then there was no point in beating him!</font>

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Oars is back on his feet!</font>

55
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought that attack alone was enough to leave him unconscious!</font>

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible...</font>

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over.</font>

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entire Straw Hat crew is unconscious right now.</font>

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already used all the shadows we had.</font>

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have anything left to defeat him with.</font>

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't hurt at all.</font>

62
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems we were no match for the power of a zombie after all!</font>

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no time left.</font>

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dawn is almost upon us.</font>

66
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll never be freed from dwelling in darkness!</font>

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's give up.</font>

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll only find death if we stay here.</font>

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go back to the forest.</font>

70
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's return... to that gloomy forest where no light can be seen.</font>

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what happened to Luffy, but...</font>

73
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have the upper hand right now.</font>

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! Wait a minute, you!</font>

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you move in that state you'll die!</font>

76
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He received the attack of that monster... How come he's still standing?!</font>

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't tell which one is the zombie here!</font>

78
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where did the Straw Hats we rescued go?</font>

79
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't ask me!</font>

80
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They couldn't have moved while being unconscious!</font>

81
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, where are the other two?</font>

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You're right!</font>

83
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Long-nose and the woman are both gone.</font>

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they... go ahead and run off?</font>

85
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, all of them?!</font>

86
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did they...?</font>

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It seems it wasn't good enough.</font>

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, Straw Hat!</font>

89
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, even you, Straw Hat.</font>

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just need to give him another shot.</font>

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still worn out from before.</font>

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

94
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

95
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm right here.</font>

96
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They didn't run!</font>

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need to get up there.</font>

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger.</font>

99
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then... I'll make you a foothold.</font>

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there's anything I can assist you with...</font>

101
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the one reduced to bones is moving!</font>

102
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

103
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, Brook, I have a request!</font>

104
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew this would happen!</font>

105
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's ready to give you their support!</font>

106
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The girl from before!</font>

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why's she there?!</font>

108
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me these guys...!</font>

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't intend to escape at all!</font>

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the very moment Oars stood up...</font>

111
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They began to plan their counterattack!</font>

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just watch.</font>

113
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, hurry up!</font>

114
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sun is about to rise!</font>

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this what you needed, Franky?</font>

117
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough, now give me a hand!</font>

118
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it!</font>

119
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys never intended to give up!</font>

120
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you're in the way!</font>

121
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step aside!</font>

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you order!</font>

123
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pierna Fleur...</font>

124

125
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

128
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you going?</font>

129
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

130
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoke? Clouds?</font>

131
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The forecast is rain.</font>

132

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,100

134
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's raining! How come?!</font>

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that girl a magician?</font>

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

137
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The emergency pipe is complete!</font>

138
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn.</font>

139
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Vent!</font>

140
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?!</font>

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spin with all your strength!</font>

142
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm on it!</font>

143
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes!</font>

144
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ultra Refrigerator Super Freezing Cannon...</font>

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm frozen!</font>

147
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't move!</font>

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

149
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They used it to freeze the rain!</font>

150
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time it's my turn!</font>

151
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

152
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A chain?!</font>

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

154
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rudder's chain?!</font>

155
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're amazing, Sanji!</font>

156
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was nothing!</font>

157
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw me!</font>

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure about this?!</font>

159
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be fine, I'm a rubberman after all!</font>

160
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful!</font>

161
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Third!</font>

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bone Balloon!</font>

163
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

164
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care of Oars' stomach!</font>

165
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me!</font>

166
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three Swords Style...</font>

167
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Secret Technique...</font>

168
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three Thousand Worlds!</font>

169
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now!</font>

170
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There you go!</font>

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, Sanji!</font>

172
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars' spine is completely straight now!</font>

173
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're they doing?!</font>

174
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The human spine is S-shaped in order to
alleviate the effects of shocks and weight.</font>

175
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's straightened out, the force isn't migitated, and all the damage is taken.</font>

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Luffy!</font>

177
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good luck to you!</font>

178
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you an extra-large bazooka!</font>

179
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I'll counter it with my own bazooka!</font>

180
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

181
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? It won't move!</font>

182
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My right arm won't move!</font>

183
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't stretch either!</font>

184
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The absence of pain is the zombie's greatest disadvantage.</font>

185
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's your shadow...</font>

186
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finish him off, Luffy.</font>

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

188
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

189
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take him down, Straw Hat!</font>

190
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heads up!</font>

191
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giant...</font>

192
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bazooka!</font>

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it!</font>

194
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what kind of zombie he is, he can't possibly get up after that.</font>

195
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oars lost.</font>

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And this time for good.</font>

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's gonna happen to Thriller Bark?</font>

198
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They did it.</font>

199
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're quite something.</font>

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems I brought some dangerous fellas...</font>

201
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

202
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's our Master?!</font>

203
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won!</font>

204
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time he really did it!</font>

205
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won!</font>

206
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot!</font>

207
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the best!</font>

208
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from our ray of hope!</font>

209
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This man lived up to our expectations after all!</font>

210
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Straw Hat?</font>

211
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A midget!</font>

212
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?!</font>

213
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you shrink?!</font>

214
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't hurt, and yet, I can't move.</font>

215
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still awake, despite having his bones pulverized.</font>

216
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much more can this power make fun of life.</font>

217
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The morning sun.</font>

218
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this unease I feel...?</font>

220
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!</font>

221
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get your shadow back, quickly!</font>

222
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time to celebrate!</font>

223
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone here might disappear!</font>

224
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows!</font>

225
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right! We gotta hurry!</font>

226
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, punch that Moriah awake and
make him return all of our shadows!</font>

227
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The morning sun has almost risen!</font>

228
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need...</font>

229
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to punch me awake.</font>

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah!</font>

231
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

232
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you're alright!</font>

233
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama would never fall that easily!</font>

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It is better now that you're awake!</font>

235
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:01,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now... if you don't wanna get beaten by the Straw Hats again, you better release all of our shadows!</font>

236
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, give 'em back, you bastard!</font>

237
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't a child's game.</font>

238
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A true pirate can't be threatened with that!</font>

239
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you dogs of the forest were behind this,</font>

240
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That solves the mystery of
Straw Hat's excessive power-up!</font>

241
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's disturbing to think that
you took advantage of my shadow ability!</font>

242
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

243
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back the shadows!</font>

244
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, how dare you destroy my Thriller Bark!?</font>

245
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were the one who messed with our trip!</font>

246
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give back our shadows before the sun rises!</font>

247
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Had you continued on your travels in your
current state, you would have only found death!</font>

248
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wouldn't have lasted a minute in the New World!</font>

249
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gathered some impressive subordinates, but...</font>

250
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you will lose them all!</font>

251
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know why?!</font>

252
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hat, this isn't the time to chat!</font>

253
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the sky!</font>

254
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's getting brighter!</font>

255
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and retrieve the shadows!</font>

256
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time left!</font>

257
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I found the answer from personal experience!</font>

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did I lose all my skilled subordinates after they made a reputation for themselves!?</font>

259
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I lost my companions because they were alive!</font>

260
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they're undead zombies from the very start, then you won't lose them!</font>

261
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies are immortal!</font>

262
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An unlimited amount of soldiers who can be replaced at any time!</font>

263
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll use this undead army to go after the title of Pirate King once more!</font>

264
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be grateful that I chose your shadows to become my subordinates!</font>

265
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's stuck to me!</font>

266
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now!</font>

267
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hear my words, shadows of Thriller Bark!</font>

268
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Become one with my power!</font>

269
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Asgard: heavenly residence of the gods and slain heroes in Norse mythology</i></font>

270
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadows' Asgard!</font>

271
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

272
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His shadow was taken.</font>

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows are...!</font>

274
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

275
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gathering the shadows from the whole island and absorbing them!</font>

276
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

277
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You withstood 100 shadows, didn't you?!</font>

278
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I can withstand...</font>

279
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">200!</font>

280
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">300!</font>

281
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">600!</font>

282
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">700!</font>

283
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">1000 shadows!</font>

284
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over.</font>

285
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that thing?</font>

286
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back to normal.</font>

287
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nearly morning!</font>

288
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Straw Hat couldn't defeat Oars with 100 shadows.</font>

289
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But 10 times that amount?</font>

290
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the original user can withstand a much larger amount?!</font>

291
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We're done for!</font>

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's gonna happen now?!</font>

293
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This can't be true!</font>

294
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He absorbed Straw Hat's shadow too.</font>

295
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

296
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't stand a chance!</font>

297
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, hey, hey!</font>

298
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's breaking the island apart!</font>

299
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mast-mansion is coming down!</font>

300
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

301
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run into the forest!</font>

302
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really it!</font>

303
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm disappearing!</font>

304
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body is disappearing!</font>

305
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone help me!</font>

306
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool! Hurry and get in the shade!</font>

307
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sunlight is almost upon us!</font>

308
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head to the forest through the shade!</font>

309
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't leave the mansion's shadow!</font>

310
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!</font>

312
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

313
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys run.</font>

314
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?!</font>

315
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're coming with us!</font>

316
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who’s responsible...</font>

317
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for this bet.</font>

318
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look over there.</font>

319
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They...</font>

320
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys...</font>

321
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They haven't moved an inch.</font>

322
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were also stripped of their shadows.</font>

323
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

324
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They still think they can win?!</font>

325
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he destroyed half of the island with a single blow.</font>

326
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah's power exceeds that of Oars' right now!</font>

327
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since they haven't given up yet...</font>

328
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not moving from here.</font>

329
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we keep calling them our "Ray of Hope" and then abandon them at the first sight of trouble,</font>

330
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we're nothing but a bunch of maggots.</font>

331
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in our current situation...</font>

332
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You go ahead and escape.</font>

333
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As your Captain, I promise to uphold your honor.</font>

334
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just... keep yourselves alive.</font>

335
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

336
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The light is reaching you!</font>

337
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and get in the shade!</font>

338
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay!</font>

339
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what it means to place your hopes in other people!</font>

340
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

341
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

342
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you wanna die?!</font>

343
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Life or death. There's just one answer!</font>

344
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care which one it is.</font>

345
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not going back to the darkness!</font>

346
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

347
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is going from bad to worse.</font>

348
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's completely lost it.</font>

349
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His rage and foolish pride are fueling his madness.</font>

350
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, everyone, we're out of time.</font>

351
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will be a bit reckless.</font>

352
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! We're counting on you!</font>

353
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take him down!</font>

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you!</font>

355
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What hope could you possibly have?!</font>

356
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way you can win!</font>

357
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy is a monster of 1000 men!</font>

358
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

359
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think this over!</font>

360
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He absorbed all of your shadows!</font>

361
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That monster is much more powerful than you!</font>

362
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, we're out of time!</font>

363
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't wanna get involved, just watch from there.</font>

364
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this battle against Moriah, we already have the upper hand.</font>

365
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However,</font>

366
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">winning before daybreak is a completely different matter.</font>

367
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah has exceeded his limits in order to buy as much time as possible.</font>

368
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second!</font>

369
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will we be destroyed first?</font>

370
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or...</font>

371
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will Moriah destroy himself first?</font>

372
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

373
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Rocket!</font>

374
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

375
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows are coming out!</font>

376
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Bazooka!</font>

377
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Bazooka!</font>

378
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's one after another!</font>

379
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't those shadows supposed to be under his command?!</font>

380
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah's control worsens as he loses consciousness!</font>

381
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even for Moriah, it's impossible to handle 1000 shadows!</font>

382
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

383
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brick Bat!</font>

384
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Box!</font>

385
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm trapped!</font>

386
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Disappear!</font>

387
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A direct hit!</font>

388
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The punch that divided the island!</font>

389
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

390
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

391
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is your baptism!</font>

392
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what happens to amateurs like you who try to act big in this sea!</font>

393
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what happens when you mess with a Warlord of the Sea!</font>

394
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Learn your place in this world!</font>

395
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A nail that sticks out will be hammered back into line!</font>

396
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san!</font>

397
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

398
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's back on his feet!</font>

399
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care if I'm an amateur...</font>

400
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or if I'm sticking out...</font>

401
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one...</font>

402
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can...</font>

403
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">crush me!</font>

404
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one can crush you?</font>

405
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The simple fact you make such baseless statements...</font>

406
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shows how inexperienced you a-</font>

407
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I'm made of rubber.</font>

408
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make you spit out all of the shadows!</font>

409
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is he?</font>

410
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he immortal?!</font>

411
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

412
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sunlight!</font>

413
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

414
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fools! Go back to the shade!</font>

415
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll end up disappearing!</font>

416
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

417
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My hand... is disintegrating!</font>

418
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get in the shade!</font>

419
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This whole place is a dead zone!</font>

420
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bone Balloon!</font>

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is it okay to use that technique too?!</font>

422
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way!</font>

423
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you forget that Second alone wears out your body?!</font>

424
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be reckless, Luffy!</font>

425
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your body... will be torn apart!</font>

426
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

427
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giant...</font>

428
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Shell!</font>

429
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So powerful!</font>

430
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows are coming out!</font>

431
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let... my army get away!</font>

432
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadows!</font>

433
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am your master!</font>

434
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard!</font>

435
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not letting the shadows get away!</font>

436
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My shadow!</font>

437
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back to me!</font>

438
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

439
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

440
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you hear me, shadow?!</font>

441
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been together ever since we were born!</font>

442
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were born in this world together!</font>

443
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please come back!</font>

444
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For three long years, I kept looking for the zombie in which you were trapped!</font>

445
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now you're right before me, aren't you?!</font>

446
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can hear me, please come back!</font>

447
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please come back!</font>

448
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Lola!</font>

449
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please take cover in the wall's shade already!</font>

450
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your body could disappear!</font>

451
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... it's awful.</font>

452
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when I've finally found it!</font>

453
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

454
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, all of our shadows must be inside Moriah!</font>

455
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're never gonna get a chance like this again!</font>

456
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unfortunately, the enemy is a Warlord of the Sea.</font>

457
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, come back!</font>

458
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back to me, shadow!</font>

459
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

460
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

461
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

462
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

463
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I also have something to say to my shadow.</font>

464
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're so eager to be the Pirate King...</font>

465
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and...</font>

466
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back to me!</font>

467
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat, why you!</font>

468
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

469
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will see...</font>

470
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the New World... you will face the real nightmares!</font>

471
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the New World...!</font>

472
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadows are returning!</font>

473
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, everyone!</font>

474
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

475
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shadow! Quickly...!</font>

476
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too late!</font>
