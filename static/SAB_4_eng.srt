116
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I ate a lot!</font>

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in Heaven!</font>

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, what a wonderful afternoon...</font>

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I have eaten takoyaki..</font>

125
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected of the Straw Hat crew...</font>

126
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I had six more arms.</font>

127

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I'm satisfied too.</font>

131
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was really good!</font>

132
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't eat any more...</font>

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you a cup of tea.</font>

137
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

138
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's some good tea!</font>

139
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the course we're gonna take.</font>

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're headed for the Sabaody Archipelago.</font>

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't get to Fishman Island without going there first?</font>

142
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We Fishmen and merfolk can just dive straight down to go back.</font>

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're humans, so if you tried to dive down there, the pressure would kill you!</font>

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed...</font>

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The submarine couldn't reach it either.</font>

146
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, pay attention!</font>

147
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like you don't know anything...</font>

148
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'll tell you a thing or two about these seas!</font>

149
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

150
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is gonna do that?</font>

151
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That...</font>

152
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would...</font>

153
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be...</font>

154
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me!</font>

155
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, would you please listen?</font>

156
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To start with, there are actually two routes you can take to reach the New World!</font>

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But only one of them is accessible for outlaws, like yourselves!</font>

158
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

159
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's because...</font>

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One requires the World Government's permission,</font>

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for you to cross the Red Line by going over the top,</font>

162
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">through the Holy Land Mariejoa at its summit!</font>

163
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, there's no way a pirate would be allowed to pass through like that.</font>

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean, walking over the Red Line?</font>

165
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what would we do about the ship?</font>

166
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd have to leave the ship behind, and get a new one on the other side.</font>

167
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the ship behind?!</font>

168
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

169
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Getting permission takes both time and money, but it's the safest way to get there.</font>

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

171
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

172
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The passage you're taking will allow you to get through with your ship and everything!</font>

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That passage is known as...</font>

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Ocean-floor Route, which goes straight by Fishman Island!</font>

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the Ocean-floor Route is pretty dangerous as well.</font>

176
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

177
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Camie, Camie?</font>

178
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

179
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I didn't say you could take over...</font>

180
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of people who are eaten, along with their ships, by sea-monsters and Sea Kings.</font>

181
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Hey!</font>

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it...</font>

183
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would be pretty dangerous.</font>

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right?</font>

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to go to Fishman Island after all...</font>

186
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me neither...</font>

187
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, Camie!</font>

188
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you just say "along with their ships"?</font>

189
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

191
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of ship can we use to travel on the ocean-floor?</font>

192
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship.</font>

193
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

194
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, this ship can't travel under water!</font>

195
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it'll be alright.</font>

196
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see, inside of that huge wall, that circles the whole globe, the Red Line...</font>

198
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there's a small hole in a certain spot.</font>

199
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although from our perspective, it's a huge hole.</font>

200
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that's where Fishman Island is!</font>

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, it's right underneath the Holy Land, Mariejoa!</font>

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just head about ten thousand meters down, and there it is!</font>

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That far down?</font>

204
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a really nice place!</font>

205
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't Sky Island about ten thousand meters up in the sky, too?</font>

206
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, we're going to take this ship to the ocean-floor?</font>

207
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to get the ship coated at the island we're going to now.</font>

208
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coated?</font>

209
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, look ahead!</font>

210
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, we're here!</font>

211
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's beautiful!</font>

212
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's flying around...</font>

214
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I must say...</font>

215
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A true wonder.</font>

216
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bubbles...?</font>

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

218
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,590
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grand Line
Sabaody Archipelago</font>

219
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sabaody Archipelago!</font>

220
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's tons of soap-bubbles floating around!</font>

221
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful!</font>

222
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

223
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just keep floating up, one after another...</font>

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's blowing them all?</font>

225
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're rising up from the island.</font>

226
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just saying that they're rising doesn't really help...</font>

227
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

228
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I may...</font>

229
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for interrupting, but is the Log Pose alright?</font>

230
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right...</font>

231
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still pointing to Fishman Island, but...</font>

232
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say, won't this island cause it to change its course?</font>

233
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have to worry about that.</font>

234
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sabaody Archipelago is just a lot of trees.</font>

235
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, those aren't really islands?</font>

236
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Correct.</font>

237
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you ever heard of mangrove trees?</font>

238
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean trees with roots in the ocean that sink and emerge with the tides, right?</font>

239
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

240
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although the mangroves here never sink.</font>

241
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sabaody Archipelago is the largest mangrove in the world.</font>

242
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They call the trees here the Yarukiman Mangroves.</font>

243
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}"Yaru ki manman": To be pumped up.</i></font>

244
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pumped up groves?</font>

245
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, they sure look like they're excited!</font>

246
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting excited too!</font>

247
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In all, there are 79 trees, and all of them are like small islands.</font>

248
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are towns or other structures on each one.</font>

249
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the islands together are known as the Sabaody Archipelago.</font>

250
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The closest grove, grove 44, is the civilian entrance, so let's take the ship a little closer.</font>

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that we're seeing them up-close, those roots really are huge, huh?</font>

252
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that a bridge?</font>

253
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

254
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how each of the islands are connected.</font>

255
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we're here!</font>

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is grove 41.</font>

257
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where we're dropping anchor.</font>

258
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm setting foot on it first!</font>

259
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright everyone, don't forget the number here!</font>

260
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said earlier...</font>

261
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the islands are connected via bridges...</font>

262
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if you remember the number, you won't get lost.</font>

263
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even then, there is one guy who'll get lost, right?</font>

264
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is.</font>

265
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, what?</font>

266
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?!</font>

267
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One popped out from the ground!</font>

268
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's really funny!</font>

269
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

270
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got on it!</font>

271
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not popping, huh?</font>

272
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's really nice!</font>

273
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those soap-bubbles really are mysterious.</font>

274
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do they work?</font>

275
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The roots of these Yarukiman Mangroves... secrete a unique kind of resin.</font>

276
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no!</font>

277
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is all sticky.</font>

278
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't wipe it off!</font>

279
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, when the trees "breathe out", the resin {gets}is blown out as well, and forms these soap-bubbles.</font>

280
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

281
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's why they're all floating into the sky?</font>

282
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So all of this is actually natural?</font>

283
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

284
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

285
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!</font>

286
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did you get up there?!</font>

287
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see an amusement park over there!</font>

288
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

289
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's ride the ferris wheel!</font>

290
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An amusement park?</font>

291
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Sabaody Park.</font>

292
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How nice...</font>

293
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ferris wheel...</font>

294
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Riding on that is my dream.</font>

295
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your dream?</font>

296
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can't you ride it?</font>

297
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

298
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't do that, Camie!</font>

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I know...</font>

300
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to ride it too, but I guess I can't...</font>

301
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Hachi...</font>

302
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's our goal on this island?</font>

303
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said something about coating for the ship earlier, didn't you?</font>

304
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to find a coating mechanic, and have him coat your ship with this resin!</font>

305
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Simply put, that will enable your ship to travel under the sea!</font>

306
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?</font>

307
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the only way humans can reach Fishman Island.</font>

308
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, if you get an amateur to do it...</font>

309
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship, and the humans riding it, would be crushed by the water-pressure.</font>

310
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know one mechanic who's trustworthy, so I'm gonna take you to him.</font>

311
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Octopus-san, you are such a nice fellow for helping us so much...</font>

312
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, he is a nice octopus!</font>

313
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In exchange...</font>

314
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like you to make just a single promise to me.</font>

315
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, what is it?</font>

316
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once we enter the city, we might run into the World Nobles walking around there.</font>

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are they?</font>

318
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The citizens of the Holy Land, Mariejoa.</font>

319
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And, what about them?</font>

320
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what might happen in the city...</font>

321
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want you to promise that you won't lay a hand on the World Nobles!</font>

322
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if someone were to be killed...</font>

323
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right before your very eyes...</font>

324
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just pretend you didn't see anything!</font>

325
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone left for the town...</font>

326
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not going?</font>

327
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We used up all our cola in that battle back there.</font>

328
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Taking care of the ship is my job!</font>

329
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, I wanted to help out as well!</font>

330
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once we're done, let's head out, all three of us.</font>

331
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island looks fun!</font>

332
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah...</font>

333
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't leave the ship before someone comes back.</font>

334
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, why?</font>

335
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you see...</font>

336
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My beloved Nami-san said...</font>

337
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hmm, this is a problem...</i></font>

338
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We've got tons of treasure stored on the ship right now...</i></font>

339
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Is there a knight around who would safeguard it?</i></font>

340
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ta-daah!</i></font>

341
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

342
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really do anything Nami wants you to, huh?</font>

343
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am a slave of love!</font>

344
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point if you admit it yourself...</font>

345
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

346
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

347
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

348
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?!</font>

349
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-kun?!</font>

350
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you going, all by yourself?</font>

351
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a walk.</font>

352
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what?</font>

353
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

354
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't! You'll get lost, dammit!</font>

355
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an Archipelago, you know?!</font>

356
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't be able to find you!</font>

357
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'd get lost!</font>

358
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who'd get lost on an island like this, where it's so easy to find your way?</font>

359
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Each of the trees have a number on them, right?</font>

360
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even a kid with the worst sense of direction would be able to find his way!</font>

361
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd thought that far ahead?</font>

362
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think of that.</font>

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry!</font>

364
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful!</font>

365
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget to ask for directions!</font>

366
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't believe in yourself!</font>

367
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're going way overboard.</font>

368
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as I don't forget the number on this tree...</font>

369
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Number one, right?</font>

370
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Nobles are also known as the Celestial Dragons.</font>

371
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're really arrogant, and wear a mask so they don't have to breathe the same air as everyone else.</font>

372
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, don't try to oppose those guys.</font>

373
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need you to promise that!</font>

374
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

375
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there are several other things to look out for.</font>

376
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said earlier, this island is where everyone who wants to go to the New World, gathers.</font>

377
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of big-name pirates like yourselves...</font>

378
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then there are marines and bounty-hunters trying to catch them.</font>

379
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also...</font>

380
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnappers!</font>

381
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if pirates are taken away by slave-traders, the law won't protect them.</font>

382
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do anything to get yourselves noticed, they'll go after you instantly, so be careful!</font>

383
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines around here are not to be taken lightly.</font>

384
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These waters are close to the Navy HQ, after all.</font>

385
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the bounty-hunters around here are on a totally different level as well!</font>

386
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's one more thing...</font>

387
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

388
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too concerned about stuff!</font>

389
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie and I are not a mermaid and a fishman, okay?</font>

390
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While we're here, please pretend that we're ordinary people.</font>

391
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

392
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just easier that way.</font>

393
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should follow the customs of the culture around here, Luffy.</font>

394
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just do as the octopus told us to.</font>

395
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There we go...</font>

396
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slowly, slowly...</font>

397
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in!</font>

398
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How amusing!</font>

399
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really is mysterious...</font>

400
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting into it!</font>

401
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">None of the air is coming out, either!</font>

402
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then...</font>

403
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about putting this in?</font>

404
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like this?</font>

405
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that about the right height?</font>

406
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you can drive around with it.</font>

407
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm moving!</font>

408
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

409
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is fun!</font>

410
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is not breaking!</font>

411
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't they convenient, the Sabaody Archipelago's exclusive Bubble Bike?</font>

412
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about it?</font>

413
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to rent it, it's 500 Belly per person.</font>

414
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to buy it, it's 1,000 Belly!</font>

415
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheap, isn't it?</font>

416
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, we'll rent one.</font>

417
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want one!</font>

418
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna buy it with my spending money!</font>

419
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too, me too!</font>

420
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't.</font>

421
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in buying it, just rent one.</font>

422
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why should you get to decide that?</font>

423
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

424
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I'll tell you the reason later.</font>

425
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man!</font>

426
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll rent two more of them.</font>

427
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're a local, huh? That's too bad...</font>

428
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This feels great!</font>

429
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm definitely buying one of these Bubble bikes!</font>

430
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat...</font>

431
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You rode the soap bubbles into the sky when we first got here, right?</font>

432
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you fall?</font>

433
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, well, when I reached the top of the trees, I thought I'd go even higher...</font>

434
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then all the soap bubbles around me suddenly started popping...</font>

435
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then the one I was riding did, too...</font>

436
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, I ended up falling.</font>

437
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's because you left the Sabaody Archipelago's unique atmosphere.</font>

438
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place has a special, unique climate specifically suited to the Yarukiman Mangroves.</font>

439
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But once you leave that climate, the soap bubbles won't be strong enough to stay whole.</font>

440
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so?</font>

441
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, that means that you can only ride the soap bubbles...</font>

442
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for as long as you stay on the island, doesn't it?</font>

443
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how it is.</font>

444
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People who come here for the first time often buy a Bubble bike...</font>

445
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's basically a rip-off.</font>

446
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Renting one is good enough.</font>

447
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I think I'll buy one!</font>

448
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't accept that explanation at all...</font>

449
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't get it, do you?</font>

450
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In short, once you leave the island, the soap bubbles will break.</font>

451
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's mysterious, isn't it?</font>

452
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

453
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just mysteriously break?</font>

454
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you say so right away?!</font>

455
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, but Luffy-chin, you can use them at Fishman Island.</font>

456
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got soap bubbles on the ocean floor too.</font>

457
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go to Fishman Island soon~</font>

458
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really looking forward to it~</font>

459
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, you should meet the mermaid princess!</font>

460
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's so beautiful, I can't even describe it!</font>

461
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't look away from her myself!</font>

462
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be looking forward to that!</font>

463
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a good eye for beauties...</font>

464
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though being a skeleton, I do not have eyes.</font>

465
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh, are you listening?</font>

466
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, this looks good!</font>

467
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's Graman?</font>

468
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Manjuu: Steamed bun</i></font>

469
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're Grand Line Manjuus!</font>

470
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or Graman for short.</font>

471
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you like to taste some?</font>

472
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can see that it's got "Grand Line First Half" written on it, right?</font>

473
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The idea is to take them into the New World as a souvenir of sorts.</font>

474
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll last for about three months, so don't worry about it!</font>

475
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This tastes great!</font>

476
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I open another package?</font>

477
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you gonna buy any?!</font>

478
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grove 35...</font>

479
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are lots of hotels here, aren't there?</font>

480
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the living quarters for those waiting for permission to pass through Mariejoa.</font>

481
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's really easy to make these hotels...</font>

482
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See that over there?</font>

483
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just coat those huge soap bubbles in a special alloy, and the foundation is done.</font>

484
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how they make those round buildings.</font>

485
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

486
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

487
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a shopping mall?!</font>

488
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back any time!</font>

489
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grasen...</font>

490
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grachoco...</font>

491
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A key-holder!</font>

492
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pennant!</font>

493
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on to those memories!</font>

494
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bought a lot of them, huh?</font>

495
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carrying that around everywhere should be a problem...</font>

496
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put them in the Bubble bag.</font>

497
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bubble bag?</font>

498
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so light!</font>

499
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't need to put in any effort to carry your luggage on this island, huh?</font>

500
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

501
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did Nami and Robin go?</font>

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They went to the shopping mall in Grove 30.</font>

503
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They said they'd leave the coating of the ship to us.</font>

504
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so that's it?</font>

505
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

506
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to us!</font>

507
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though we invited her, Camie-chan wouldn't come with us...</font>

508
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's seemed more reserved ever since we arrived on this island...</font>

509
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could be bothering Camie?</font>

510
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps there is some sort of bad history on this island...?</font>

511
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bad history...?</font>

512
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in the lead!</font>

513
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get cocky!</font>

514
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still a long way to go!</font>

515
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Hacchin!</font>

516
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did this turn into a race?</font>

517
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's all the commotion about?</font>

518
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you!</font>

519
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

520
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm asking you a favor here!</font>

521
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone's fine!</font>

522
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An axe!</font>

523
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A saw!</font>

524
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything will do!</font>

525
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give me something!</font>

526
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just want to get this off my neck!</font>

527
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't hurt anyone!</font>

528
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let go of me...</font>

529
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to die...</font>

530
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've given up on going to the New World!</font>

531
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a wife and a child back home!</font>

532
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you!</font>

533
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please lend me a hand!</font>

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go home!</font>

535
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Last time I saw my kid, he was still a baby...</font>

536
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He still doesn't even know what I look like!</font>

537
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you!</font>

538
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...</font>

539
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go home!</font>

540
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, please!</font>

541
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please help me!</font>

542
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get involved.</font>

543
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably a pirate who was caught by kidnappers and sold as a slave...</font>

544
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His owner probably brought him to this island, and he made a run for it!</font>

545
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he should know that he can't escape!</font>

546
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's that sound?</font>

547
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

548
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ring!</font>

549
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I could just get this off my neck!</font>

550
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

551
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

552
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

553
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!</font>

554
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

555
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

556
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it all to Hell!</font>

557
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slaves always have those chains attached to their necks...</font>

558
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they try to take them off or run away, they'll explode!</font>

559
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just let me buy some souvenirs and go home...</font>

560
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've given up on being a pirate...</font>

561
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a slave who tried to run away!</font>

562
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away!</font>

563
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get involved with him!</font>

564
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Look at that...</font>

565
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to help him!</font>

566
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot!</font>

567
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You promised to not get involved, no matter what, right?!</font>

568
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this city?!</font>

569
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin, what are we going to do?!</font>

570
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons are nearby!</font>

571
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright.</font>

572
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down, Camie!</font>

573
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

574
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of the Bubble bike!</font>

575
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

576
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

577
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hurry up and do it!</font>

578
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, sure...</font>

579
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're here!</font>

580
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are those the Celestial Dragons?</font>

581
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to bow down too!</font>

582
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

583
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, don't look them in the eyes!</font>

584
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, how vulgar, Saruu!</font>

585
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Them, huh?</font>

586
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,180
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="34">Celestial Dragon
Saint Roswald</font></font>

587
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:56,180
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="34">Celestial Dragon
Saint Shalria</font></font>

588
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, Father.</font>

589
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yet another one has been broken.</font>

590
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you make sure to give him his tranquilizer every day?</font>

591
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, yes, I did.</font>

592
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, it appears that it does not work on fools...</font>

593
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you please buy me a new one?</font>

594
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your disciplining skills are truly terrible.</font>

595
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You keep destroying my captain collection, one after another...</font>

596
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This one is certainly useless.</font>

597
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A grown man always crying about family this, family that...</font>

598
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are just a mere human!</font>

599
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't even move any more!</font>

600
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You disgust me!</font>

601
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, that-!</font>

602
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait!</font>

603
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like a giant slave next.</font>

604
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should start with a human child.</font>

605
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I detest the weak.</font>

606
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't do anything rash!</font>

607
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the marines!</font>

608
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it, move it!</font>

609
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First off, we should get away from here!</font>

610
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about some tea?</font>

611
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will help you calm down.</font>

612
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel terrible...</font>

613
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think that guy will be alright?</font>

614
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a pirate, so even if they save him, he'll just be sent to prison.</font>

615
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pirate should be able to beat that old guy and the woman, right?</font>

616
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

617
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you hurt one of the Celestial Dragons...</font>

618
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An admiral from Navy HQ and a fleet of battle ships will come here.</font>

619
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An admiral...</font>

620
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aokiji?!</font>

621
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It could be Akainu or Kizaru...</font>

622
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way to know who'd show up.</font>

623
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The HQ is right next to us, after all.</font>

624
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What makes those guys so special?!</font>

625
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys are descendants of the creators!</font>

626
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The creators?</font>

627
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">800 years ago, a group of 20 kings formed the organization known as the World Government.</font>

628
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons are their descendants.</font>

629
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And over the course of the years...</font>

630
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've come to abuse their incredible influence.</font>

631
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons...</font>
