00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HE ABSORBED ALL THAT ENERGY?!</font>

2
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're unbelievable!</font>

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ain't human!</font>

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way you could've survived Magellan's poisons!</font>

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He beat the poisoning in only 20 hours!</font>

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an unbelievable miracle!</font>

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A miracle...</font>

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is more than a miracle!</font>

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hooray!</font>

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank God...</font>

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan!</font>

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're alright after all.</font>

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid! Quit joking around!</font>

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who ought to be saying...</font>

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan! Hey!</font>

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You okay? Hang in there!</font>

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong? Hey!</font>

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just overexerted himself.</font>

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His injuries have nothing to do with it.</font>

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Iva-chan...</font>

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan!</font>

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We survived! Thanks a lot for everything you've done for us.</font>

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's this Mister Two Bon-boy vyou should be thanking.</font>

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi just used vmy abilities and lent vyou some strength.</font>

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he...</font>

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He kept on shouting for hours on end...</font>

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until his throat was dry and he was coughing up blood...</font>

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He stayed here all along, sharing vyour pain...</font>

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Constantly shouting for vyou to hang in there and live on!</font>

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi'm pretty sure he made at least some difference in vyour struggle to survive.</font>

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that guy?</font>

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's naked...</font>

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan... I'm here to save you...!</font>

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the name of our friendship...!</font>

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan, thanks a lot.</font>

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in your debt!</font>

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here's your hat and some clothes.</font>

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've survived, but that's all.</font>

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't make a full recovery
until you've rested a few days.</font>

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time for that!</font>

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've wasted too much time already!</font>

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, but can you guys take care of Bon-chan?</font>

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll come back for him later.</font>

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey!</font>

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? You're completely worn out.</font>

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The paper is still pointing down.</font>

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace is down there...</font>

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, where are we?</font>

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

51
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a Vivre Card?</font>

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the space between Levels Five and Six.</font>

53
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that vyou've recovered,</font>

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi suppose vyou don't care about anything other than saving vyour brother, right?</font>

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's none of vmy business what vyou do with vyour life...</font>

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan, aren't you gonna escape?</font>

57
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, Bon-chan came down here hoping to save your ass, y'know?</font>

58
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>His ass?!</i></font>

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mind telling me where Ace is while you're escaping?</font>

60
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are vyou saying?</font>

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-boy came here to save vme?</font>

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how it is, huh?</font>

63
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well isn't that cute...</font>

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the thought that counts, Vi guess...</font>

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's not the time for vme to break out just yet!</font>

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi understand the balance of power in the world.</font>

67
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy and the Whitebeard Pirates are both trying to shift the world in their favor...</font>

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But "that man" has yet to make his move.</font>

69
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who oversees all the revolutionaries in the world...</font>

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vmy companion...</font>

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The revolutionary, Dragon!</font>

72
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you mean my dad?</font>

73
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

74
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As soon as vyour dad rallies his troops and makes his move...</font>

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi shall once again return to the surface and throw vmyself into the flow of the world.</font>

76
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if Vi were to try and escape right now,</font>

77
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi would merely end up being hunted down.</font>

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">DID HE SAY "DAD"?!</font>

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dragon is...</font>

80
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">vyour dad?!</font>

81
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">V-V-Vyou've got to be kidding vme!</font>

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou're Dragon's son?!</font>

83
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has a son?!</font>

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah...</font>

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wasn't supposed to tell anyone...</font>

86
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever. Gramps told me...</font>

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your father's name is...</i></font>

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Monkey D. Dragon.</i></font>

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's a revolutionary.{Garp is clearly only capable of discussing matters of lineage with his finger up his nose.}</i></font>

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really know him myself...</font>

91
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be honest, I don't even know what he looks like.</font>

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he doesn't know, that just makes it all the more convincing!</font>

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't look like a liar, and he's made a huge impact on the pirate world!</font>

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he just demonstrated a will to live that defies common sense!</font>

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not normal!</font>

96
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What he said makes perfect sense!</font>

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are vyou from?</font>

98
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">East Blue.</font>

99
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dragon...</i></font>

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>When vyou're standing out here in the wind,</i></font>

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>vyou always face the same direction, vyou know.</i></font>

102
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Really?</i></font>

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You notice the strangest things, don't you?</i></font>

104
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've never really thought about it.</i></font>

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then maybe it's an animal-like homing instinct?</i></font>

106
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Isn't vyour hometown somewhere off in that direction?</i></font>

107
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Do vyou have some family vyou long for back in the eastern seas?{recheck: should this be sea or seas?}</i></font>

108
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Well?</i></font>

109
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop enquiring about my personal history, Iva.</i></font>

110
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pardon vme.</i></font>

111
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's true...</font>

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw-Hat-boy here really IS Dragon's son...</font>

113
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inazuma! Go find out when Ace-boy is being taken to his execution.</font>

114
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right away.</font>

115
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be a race against time.</font>

116
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Vivre Card is pointing down,</font>

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then he hasn't been taken away yet.</font>

118
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi will be heading to Level Six alongside Straw-Hat-boy here.</font>

119
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna show me the way?</font>

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... Level Six?</font>

121
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was Level Five...</font>

122
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like he said, this is Level 5.5.</font>

123
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever. I'm counting on you. Let's go!</font>

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi was careless!</font>

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi never even considered this!</font>

126
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would mean Straw-Hat-boy's brother, Ace, is also Dragon's son!{holy deceptive foreshadowing, batman!}</font>

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could the Navy be doing this intentionally?</font>

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Vi can see no advantage for the Government in angering both Whitebeard and Dragon!</font>

129
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What <i>is</i> the Government thinking?!</font>

130
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, now is the time to break out of here!</font>

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, Bon-chan. I'll come pick you up later, okay?</font>

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the future, vyou must not let slip such information about vyour origins!</font>

134
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you're probably right...</font>

135
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi am vyour father's companion.</font>

136
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the leaders of the revolutionary army.</font>

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the reason Vi was locked away here.</font>

138
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi might be acting of vmy own accord, but Vi have a duty to support vyou!</font>

139
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi will not let a friend's son die while Vi'm around to see it!</font>

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give the message to all inhabitants of Newkama Land!</font>

141
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe will hereby attempt to save Ace-boy and break out of Impel Down!</font>

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! All of a sudden?!</font>

143
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You might say that, but...</font>

144
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Important decisions are always made suddenly!</font>

145
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who want to come along, prepare vyourselves for the worst and gather here, ready to fight!</font>

146
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Wait for me, Ace!</font>

147
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be right there!</font>

148
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His pulse...</font>

149
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is still there!</font>

150
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It is?!</i></font>

151
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emporio Tension Hormone!</font>

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's adrenaline.</font>

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou'll be able to ignore vyour fatigue for one day.</font>

154
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou'll suffer some major aftereffects in exchange for it, but Vi assume vyou don't mind?</font>

155
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister Two, Mister Three and Buggy the Clown...</font>

156
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're sure these three entered Level Five, right?</font>

157
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. Their disguise was flawless.</font>

158
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, the only thing we found on Level Five was a blood-stained headdress.</font>

159
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We assume that, after Straw Hat was let out of his cage, the four of them were eaten by wolves.</font>

160
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

161
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think I'd have to wear this specially-made headdress before I became Warden...</font>

162
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't even gotten rid of Magellan yet!</font>

163
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're giving away your motives!</font>

164
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they manage to break out again, you and the Warden might both lose your jobs.</font>

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll take MY job too?!</font>

166
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,040
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Inside the elevator to level 6</font>

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're late.</font>

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so harsh, Domino.</font>

169
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please finish up sooner next time.</font>

170
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so unreasonable...</font>

171
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are to hand over the prisoner at the main entrance at exactly nine o'clock this morning.</font>

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is our mission.</font>

173
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we cannot complete it, it will tarnish the reputation of Impel Down.</font>

174
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,940
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down Main Entrance</font>

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it?</font>

176
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the moment we take
Portgas D. Ace into custody...</font>

177
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until the moment we've reached Marineford and handed the prisoner over...</font>

178
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are not permitted to drop your guard, even for a second!</font>

179
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

180
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare for the worst.</font>

181
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the duty of our five Navy Vice-Admirals and warships to escort the prisoner without any breach of security!</font>

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not accept any mistakes!</font>

183
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh wow, I'm overflowing with energy!</font>

185
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us hurry.</font>

186
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the slightest delay could change the outcome of our actions.</font>

187
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one is watching us here, so as long as vwe don't waste time sneaking around, vwe'll get there very fast!</font>

188
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep moving as fast as vyou can!</font>

189
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

190
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're those guys running by?</font>

191
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...</font>

192
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the same Ivankov who's supposed to be dead?!</font>

193
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

194
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>MOVE IT!</i></font>

195
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>DON'T GET IN OUR WAY!</i></font>

196
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death Wink!</font>

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inazuma! The keys!</font>

198
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

199
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are surveillance cameras past this point.</font>

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they're gonna come for us, then let 'em come!</font>

201
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Suspicious figures spotted!</font>

202
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone is running down the hallway between Levels Five and Six!</font>

203
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man...!</font>

204
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the Okama Queen who vanished a few years back, Ivankov!</font>

205
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where has he been all these years?!</font>

207
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guy next to him is the one who broke in yesterday, Straw Hat Luffy!{That was just one day? orz}</font>

208
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought the Warden's poison killed him!</font>

209
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's another prisoner we thought had vanished!</font>

210
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The revolutionary from South Blue, Inazuma!</font>

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

212
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're heading straight for Level Six!</font>

213
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're after Fire Fist Ace after all?!</font>

214
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Domino-san and Warden Magellan are going to Level Six right now!</font>

215
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate, they'll run right into each other!</font>

216
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're still alive?</font>

217
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden!</font>

218
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Activate the traps in the corridor!</font>

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have the guards on Level Six prepare for battle!</font>

220
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure they'll hold out until Sadi-chan and the Demon Guards get there!</font>

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, contact Warden Magellan and alert all Floors!</font>

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't just stand there! Hurry up!</font>

223
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

224
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Assistant Warden is taking this seriously all of a sudden?!</font>

225
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could he be an impostor?!</font>

226
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must capture them at all costs!</font>

227
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not cutting my head off!</font>

228
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make it! Make it!</font>

229
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming now, Ace!</font>

230
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then.</font>

231
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Portgas D. Ace...</font>

232
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will now be taken to the city where your execution is to take place, Marineford!</font>

233
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace!!</font>

234
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

235
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out of the way!</font>

236
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

237
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ricochet!</font>

238
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The traps had no effect.</font>

239
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All guards were eliminated.</font>

240
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-Hat Luffy...</font>

241
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okama Queen Ivankov...</font>

242
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Revolutionary Inazuma...</font>

243
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These three criminals are now entering Level Six!</font>

244
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you, Ace?!</font>

245
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here to save you!!</font>

246
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace!!</font>

247
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this it?!</font>

248
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace!</font>

249
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not here!</font>

250
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are vyou sure this is the right cage?</font>

251
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no doubt about it!</font>

252
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't...</font>

253
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">do such a thing as lie...!</font>

254
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems we were one step behind.</font>

255
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A straw hat... This man...</font>

256
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has to be!</font>

257
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>She said...</i></font>

258
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That my brother's coming here.</i></font>

259
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really here!</font>

260
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To break into the impenetrable Impel Down...</font>

261
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and come all the way down to Level Six, he is really...</font>

262
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you Straw-Hat Luffy?</font>

263
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

264
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've just taken him. Chase after them!</font>

265
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-san was being escorted to the lift!</font>

266
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">GO! You can still make it if you hurry!</font>

267
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old dude... Who're you?{ //Ossan }</font>

268
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is another of the big shots!</font>

269
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, I got it!</font>

270
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks! Whoever you are!</font>

271
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it...</font>

272
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One or two lives shouldn't be enough to get a man down here! {Just risking one or two of your lives can't possibly be enough to get you down here... //Actually, I'm not entirely sure about this myself, but I believe this is closer.}</font>

273
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he really pass through all Five Hells?!</font>

274
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must have used this to reach the upper floors.</font>

275
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

276
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've left the gate open for the lift!</font>

277
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

278
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mechanisms are locked; it's useless!</font>

279
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't use it?!</font>

280
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we climb this we can probably make it up-</font><font size="20"></font>

281
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it!</font>

282
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir!</font>

283
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That was close!</font>

284
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's to be expected.</font>

285
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like they'd just let us climb up.</font>

286
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The lift is useless!</font>

287
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're watching vour every move. {They've got their hands all over the place.}</font>

288
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's use the stairs vwe came down!</font>

289
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... They blocked the stairs.</font>

290
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're trying to close us in.</font>

291
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vwe can't break this, there's no way out!</font>

292
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a massive gas cloud!</font>

293
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me it's poisonous?!</font>

294
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys.</font>

295
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno who you are, but don't make us suffer because of your stupidity.</font>

296
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence, you "Level Sixers"!</font>

297
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care if it's poison or whatever!</font>

298
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be sleeping gas!</font>

300
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a limit to recklessness, Straw-Hat-boy!</font>

301
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop screwing around, seriously...</font>

302
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come this way!</font>

303
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're going to put everyone on this floor to sleep...</font>

304
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and then finish us off.</font>

305
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden</font>

306
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level Six is now sealed!</font>

307
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sleeping gas is powerful.</font>

308
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no escape.</font>

309
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just to be safe, keep all armed guards on standby.</font>

310
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you report to Warden Magellan yet?</font>

311
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now, sir!</font>

312
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.</font>

313
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And with this, it seems I've managed to secure my job!</font>

314
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now all I have to do is push the responsibility for this mess onto Magellan, and...</font>

315
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can finally become Warden!</font>

316
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the microphone's still on...</font>

317
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?!</font>

318
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How unfortunate for you.</font>

319
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been informed Straw-Hat arrived on Level Six not long after we left.</font>

320
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Luffy!</font>

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are no other ways out!</font>

322
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The emergency sleeping gas was released a few moments ago.</font>

323
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat's capture is only a matter of time now.</font>

324
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems the Freezing Hell wasn't enough for him.</font>

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fortunately, your cell is now available,</font>

326
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and we can inflict our ultimate torture on him down in Level Six.</font>

327
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

328
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't stop!</font>

329
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep walking!</font>

330
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

331
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop this futile resistance!</font>

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!!</font>

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your brother is also a pirate by nature.</font>

334
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no path to salvation for him.</font>

335
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted it to be a lie!</font>

336
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you come, Luffy?!</font>

337
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At any rate, no matter how great a Will,</font>

338
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that amount of poison will always be fatal.</font>

339
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you survive it...</font>

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?!</font>

341
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, do something!</font>

342
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The floor will be filled with gas!</font>

343
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me...!</font>

344
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that guy?!</font>

345
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's cutting the floor as if it was a piece of cloth!</font>

346
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Now he's folding it like paper.</font>

347
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used the folded floor to seal off the gas...</font>

348
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy's good...</font>

349
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inazuma ate the Choki Choki Fruit and has become a scissor-man.</font>

350
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Choki: Sound of snipping</i></font>

351
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can manipulate anything he cuts as if it were paper.</font>

352
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, he can?</font>

353
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't sleep!</font>

354
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm also trying vmy best to endure the gas, but...</font>

355
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

356
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm not tired!</font>

357
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not tired?!</font>

358
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's awake.</font>

359
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I wanna keep moving.</font>

360
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crab-chan! We can't catch up to Ace now that you've closed off the stairs!</font>

361
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sealing the stairs was the only way to stop the gas.</font>

362
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be impossible to rescue him if you're unconscious.</font>

363
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna save him even if I'm unconscious!</font>

364
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you realize Ace is going to be executed?!</font>

365
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be too rash though.</font>

366
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy's plan was simple, but we fell for it.</font>

367
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we're all stuck here on Level Six.</font>

368
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this situation, there's no way to escape.</font>

369
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame, now all vwe can do is this!</font>

370
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut off their connection.</font>

371
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou think logically, vwe just can't make it in time.</font>

372
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-boy will have already been escorted to the meeting place.</font>

373
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We, on the other hand, have to deal with all the enemies standing in our way.</font>

374
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The military convoy is quite fast.</font>

375
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Observe the Vivre Card.</font>

376
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not pointing directly up, is it?</font>

377
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably being handed over to the Navy as we speak.</font>

378
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now vwe need to change our attitude.</font>

379
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi will do everything in vmy power to help vyou escape this prison safely.</font>

380
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace-boy will most certainly be handed over to Navy Headquarters.</font>

381
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou'll have to give up on him.</font>

382
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In fact, all we can do after that is trust in Whitebeard.</font>

383
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not the kind of man who would discard his own men!</font>

384
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll act in one way or another...</font>

385
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going too.</font>

386
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

387
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to Navy Headquarters!</font>

388
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are vyou stupid?!</font>

389
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a battle between the world's greatest powers!</font>

390
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What can vyou do if you go there?</font>

391
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do vyou realize Whitebeard's true strength?!</font>

392
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do vyou realize the Navy's true strength in it's admirals, vice-admirals, and Warlords?!</font>

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did vyou forget that vyou fought Magellan one on one and almost died?!</font>

394
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many lives do you think you have to spare?!</font>

395
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it...</font>

396
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I give up now,</font>

397
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll regret it forever!</font>

398
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This feeling...</font>

399
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've felt it countless times before...</font>

400
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the exact same feeling I get when looking at Dragon!</font>

401
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before all that, we can't even escape from this floor!</font>

402
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you wanna escape from here, set me free.</font>

403
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can open a hole in the ceiling.</font>

404
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So how about it?</font>

405
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...!</font>

406
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a prisoner here?!</font>

407
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crocodile!</font>

408
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="30">Former Royal Shichibukai</font></font>

409
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="30">Former Baroque Works President (Mr. 0)</font></font>

410
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Pirate</font>

411
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="46">Sir Crocodile</font></font>

412
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time no see!</font>

413
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd been thinking that even if I <i>were</i> on the outside, there'd be nothing going on to interest me.</font>

414
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now I hear the Whitebeard Pirates and the Navy are going to war?</font>

415
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought I'd get the chance to take that old man's head.</font>

416
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm interested in this war.</font>

417
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With my powers, we can all escape from here.</font>

418
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not a bad deal, is it?</font>

419
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've both got something to gain from it.</font>

420
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get real!</font>

421
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who messed up Vivi's country...</font>

422
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's all in the past.</font>

423
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I no longer have any interest in that country.</font>

424
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's release him, Straw-Hat-boy.</font>

425
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He would certainly make a powerful ally.</font>

426
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan! That guy's...</font>

427
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vyou're not stopping here.</font>

428
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If vyou're going to Navy HQ, vyou'll need him even more.</font>

429
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ivankov...!</font>

430
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time no see, Croco-boy.</font>

431
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? You know him?</font>

432
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe've met...</font>

433
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when he was still a rookie.</font>

434
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be alright.</font>

435
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he were to try to betray vus, Vi can hold him back.</font>

436
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi can't completely trust him, but...</font>

437
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vi've got a firm grasp on this guy's weakness.</font>

438
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as vyou're a good boy and help us out, Vi won't say a thing.</font>

439
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

440
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell? In that case, release me too!</font>

441
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too! I've got a grudge against that Whitebeard!</font>

442
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Release me too!</font>

443
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

444
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death Wink!</font>

445
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you!</font>

446
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, take me with you!</font>

447
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll definitely be able to help you!</font>

448
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've known Ace-san ever since he joined the Whitebeard Pirates!</font>

449
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's told me everything about you, his little brother!</font>

450
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here because I was opposed to this war!</font>

451
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish to save Ace-san!</font>

452
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please! Let me choose the place of my death!</font>

453
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's another of the big shots.</font>

454
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Warlord Jinbei, Knight of the Sea...</font>

455
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and Portgas D. Ace, commander of Whitebeard's second division.</font>

456
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought a connection like that could exist.</font>

457
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

458
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, is that really okay?!</font>

459
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know nothing of this guy's personality or how dangerous he might be!</font>

460
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine. Let him out.</font>

461
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am most grateful.</font>

462
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! I'm also most grateful!</font>

463
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you!</font>

464
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

465
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death Wink!</font>

466
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd never have thought we'd be bringing two Warlords along...</font>

467
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two? Who's the other one?</font>

468
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm grateful to you.</font>

469
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, I might be able to be of some use to him.</font>

470
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you were able to prevent the war between Whitebeard and the Navy...</font>

471
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it wouldn't matter in the long run.</font>

472
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One way or another, I will definitely take that old man's head.</font>

473
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you lay a hand on old Whitebeard, Crocodile!</font>

474
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, maybe I should just kill you now?</font>

475
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Croco-boy! Vyour past, remember?</font>

476
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then. There's no time to waste.</font>

477
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe're gonna force our way out of this prison!</font>
