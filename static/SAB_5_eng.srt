00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So many bounty-hunters suddenly showed up...</font>

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was the third group to attack us.</font>

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are fewer people around, and the shops and cities, feel rather suspicious.</font>

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't seem like the kind of place where we would find a coating mechanic.</font>

00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This archipelago is huge, so there are places where the government's eyes can't reach.</font>

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a look at this.</font>

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A map, is it?</font>

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It classifies the groves in groups of ten, based on their specific traits.</font>

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why there are so many bounty-hunters around.</font>

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Couldn't you have said that sooner?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you had, you could have taken Sanji or Zoro instead of me!</font>

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That doesn't make me happy at all, you jerk!~</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That mechanic isn't some sort of monster, is he?</font>

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine! They're nice people.</font>

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,180

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,460

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my...</font>

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be, Hacchan?</font>

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long time, no see!</font>

91
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry it's been so long, Shakki.</font>

92
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. It's been at least ten years, hasn't it?</font>

93
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just sit down and wait. I've gotta finish extorting the money out of these boys here.</font>

94
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take your time.</font>

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll finish it quickly.</font>

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that so? You quit being a pirate, Hacchan?</font>

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plenty of things happened...</font>

98
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, good for you. Honesty is the best way to go, after all.</font>

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-N-No way, I... I couldn't become Hacchin's b-b-b-bride!</font>

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're overreacting.</font>

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She works with me at the Takoyaki stand.</font>

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, is that it?</font>

105
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right... Would you like something to drink...?</font>

106
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shakki-san, these beans are quite tasty.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay I don't mind.</font>

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then, I'll give you something good.</font>

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here.</font>

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cotton candy?!</font>

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's great!</font>

114
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right. It'll cost you 100,000 belly.</font>

115
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... I...</font>

116
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't have that much...</font>

117
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry! It was a joke!</font>

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't ask for payment from Hacchan's friends.</font>

119
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lady, how'd you know what Chopper's favourite food was?</font>

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Monkey-chan's crew, right?</font>

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know me?</font>

123
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course. You're the crew everyone talks about.</font>

124
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty well-informed.</font>

125
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? Luffy-chin, you're famous?</font>

126
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though, I didn't know you had a skeleton in your crew,</font>

127
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or that a living skeleton existed, for that matter.</font>

128
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There, thank you for waiting.</font>

129
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

130
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I read an article about you guys.</font>

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">About the Enies Lobby incident...</font>

132
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much of it is true?</font>

133
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it true that you picked a fight with the government?</font>

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever, it's too much trouble to tell you.</font>

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not gonna brag?</font>

136
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a big shot.</font>

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, your name is the same as that marine, Garp, right?</font>

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's my grandpa.</font>

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought so.</font>

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used to be chased around by him all the time.</font>

141
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

142
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shakki used to be a pirate.</font>

143
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

144
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gave up about forty years ago, though.</font>

145
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then... How old are you, granny?</font>

146
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These days, I think it's fun supporting rookies like yourselves.</font>

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Shakki...</font>

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No need to say it. I know, all of it.</font>

149
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason why you and Camie-chan came here,</font>

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was to help Monkey-chan and his crew get their ship coated, right?</font>

151
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was good!</font>

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here.</font>

153
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, you've got a job for Rayleigh, right?</font>

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, he isn't here.</font>

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? The mechanic isn't around?</font>

157
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wanna go to Fishman Island!</font>

158
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, there's no way he'd leave this archipelago, so...</font>

159
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about looking for him in the bars and gambling houses?</font>

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, we'll just wait until he comes back.</font>

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. He'll be back eventually...</font>

162
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been gone for half a year, though.</font>

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Half a year?!</font>

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure he's found girlfriends, and thus found places to sleep,</font>

165
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I am not exactly worried about his health.</font>

166
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose it's just how ex-pirates are. Once they leave, they won't return for a long time.</font>

167
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The old mechanic guy was a pirate, too?!</font>

168
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is quite a problem...</font>

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he isn't here, I suppose we have no choice but to look for him.</font>

170
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea where we should start?</font>

171
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see...</font>

172
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably somewhere between Grove 1 and 29...</font>

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's quite notorious, so he can't lower his guard when there are marines around.</font>

174
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then... if he's not there... he also likes going to the Sabaody Park.</font>

175
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The amusement park?!</font>

176
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! We'll look there!</font>

177
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The amusement park!</font>

178
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Camie!</font>

179
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amusement park! Amusement park!</font>

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, wherever you go to look for him, be careful.</font>

181
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Amusement park! Amusement park!</font>

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to my information, now that you've arrived, there should be...</font>

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eleven people on the Sabaody Archipelago with bounties exceeding 100 million Berry.</font>

184
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">11 people... exceeding 100 million Berry?!</font>

185
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not counting Monkey-chan and Roronoa-chan, there are nine others.</font>

186
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you entered the Grand Line,</font>

187
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there were seven paths you could take and you chose one of them,</font>

188
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and have been following the Log on that path ever since, right?</font>

189
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, there were also people who chose one of the other six routes...</font>

191
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and made it through all sorts of trouble to get here, just like yourselves.</font>

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what route you take, each of them eventually leads to the Red Line...</font>

193
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and to get past that wall, everyone comes to this archipelago.</font>

194
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understand?</font>

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though it's pretty amazing that all of the world's rookies</font>

196
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">managed to show their faces here at the same time.</font>

197
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In particular, there's Kid, Luffy, Hawkins, Drake, and Law.</font>

198
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These names have been decorating the newspapers for some time now.</font>

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't read the news.</font>

200
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're going by bounty value,</font>

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're number two among them.</font>

286
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is because his crew has badly injured civilians.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not too cute, right?</font>

291
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but if there are so many in town, I'm kinda worried...</font>

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">about the old mechanic dude.</font>

293

296
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">times?</font>

297
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, be careful then.</font>

298
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should tell you, of course, the Navy already knows...</font>

299
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that there are so many high-level rookies gathered on this archipelago.</font>

300
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is bad...</font>

301
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, they could come at us at any time?</font>

302
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.</font>

303
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if this will speed up the meeting among rookies?</font>

304
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, the Navy HQ is so busy with something else,</font>

305
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that they don't have the time to worry about you.</font>

306
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or at least, I assume so.</font>

307
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as no huge problems pop up on the archipelago,</font>

308
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy shouldn't send any major force here to deal with you.</font>

309
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So in short, just take care not to start any kind of uproar alright?</font>

310
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so that's how it is?</font>

311
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gotcha! Thanks!</font>

312
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're off to look for the old mechanic dude!</font>

313
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...that's a problem, huh?</font>

314
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But are you sure about this?</font>

323
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it'll be a problem as long as she's with those strong guys, huh?</font>

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That being said, a mermaid on land gives us a huge chance!</font>

328
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, if possible, could we have 20%?</font>

329
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,340

330

349
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. I truly prefer slow-moving attractions like this one...</font>

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys rotated it too fast!</font>

352
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,580

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! You guys, wait!</font>

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you moving? You're just humans and all...</font>

387
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sorry! Please, let this slide!</font>

388
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,980

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hospital is right ahead, too...</font>

391
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true, this is quite an injury...</font>

392
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I suppose I'd better hurry...</font>

393
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and put him to rest!</font>

394
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop!</font>

395
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my...</font>

396
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just doing as he pleases, huh?</font>

397
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My well-deserved respect or the lives of lower-class citizens...</font>

398
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which is moore important?!</font>

399
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is only through your mercy that they are given life.</font>

400
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've decided! I shall make you my wife!</font>

401
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

402
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I shall start the paperwork to have her brought to the Holy Land as Lady 13.</font>

403
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ooh, I am tired of wives 1 to 5, so you may return them to the lower classes.</font>

404
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand.</font>

405
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait! I...</font>

406
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait! She's my fiancé!</font>

407
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another one dares too stand up before me?!</font>

408
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mary...</font>

409
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

410
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you murderer! How could you?!</font>

411
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone, please... Please help him!</font>

412
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just messed up...</font>

413
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even more so than they said he was...</font>

414
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

415
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any complaints about me?</font>

416
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let me go! I'm begging you!</font>

417
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take her too the port!</font>

418
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

419
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that?</font>

420
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Apoo! He's the Pirate Hunter from East Blue!</font>

421
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he walking in the middle of the road?! Doesn't he know anything?!</font>

422
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll get us all in trouble, that guy!</font>

423
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? You want me to give you directions or something?</font>

424
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! What's he planning to do?</font>

425
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A kid...?</font>

426
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

427
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you die?</font>

428
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

429
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother, stay still.</font>

430
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

431
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You tried to attack the Celestial Dragon-sama?!</font>

432
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then of course you'd die!</font>

433
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hit him?</font>

434
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a moment, it seemed as though he had dodged it...</font>

435
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was I imagining things?</font>

436
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, as long as he's dead, then it's fine.</font>

437
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you get in my way?</font>

438
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Don't say we got in your way, you dumbass!</font>

439
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell were you trying to do?!</font>

440
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you WANT the admirals to come to this island?!</font>

441
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tomato juice...</font>

442
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even pirates have their own unspoken laws, you know!</font>

443
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just caused us a whole lot of trouble too!</font>

444
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trouble?</font>

445
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're...</font>

446
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Wasn't there a kid here?</font>

447
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you even listening to me?! Are you right in the head?!</font>

448
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I'm not hurt or anything...</font>

449
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, I'm talking about what's inside!</font>

450
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a moron!</font>

451
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Completely brain-dead!</font>

452
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to Jewelry Bonney, it seems we avoided the worst outcome...</font>

453
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man is from the Straw Hat crew, Pirate Hunter Zoro.</font>

454
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that crew has done nothing but anger the Government,</font>

455
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I didn't think they'd be so stupid as to attack the Celestial Dragons.</font>

456
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course he was spared.</font>

457
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not see the mark of death upon him.</font>

458
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard...</font>

459
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a moment, he really was ready to kill him...</font>

460
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a beast.</font>

461
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A second-in-command worth 120 million...</font>

462
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't seem like the type who'd follow orders...</font>

463
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's saying something about his captain, huh?</font>

464
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where's the hospital?</font>

465
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hospital?</font>

466
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll bring this guy there. He got shot.</font>

467
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just leave that stranger alone!</font>

468
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it.</font>

469
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pirate helping someone? Never heard of that before...</font>

470
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just had a look around town.</font>

471
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People were flying around on these bubble-bikes!</font>

472
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I saw it, I saw it! Those were cool, weren't they?</font>

473
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's buy one!</font>

474
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta find out how they ride'em!</font>

475
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, maybe that's from Nami-san?</font>

476
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hi, Nami-swa-</font>

477
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?!</font>

478
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

479
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Chopper!</font>

480
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, there were so many different kinds of ice cream...</font>

481
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We weren't paying attention!</font>

482
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are you so upset about?</font>

483
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?!</font>

484
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something terrible just happened! What do we do?!</font>

485
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not making any sense! Calm down and tell me what happened!</font>

486
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up, Sanji?</font>

487
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie has been kidnapped!</font>

488
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?!</font>

489
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's probably that team of slave-traders who did it!</font>

490
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't understand the reason,</font>

491
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but mermen and fishmen get sold off at the market, regardless of whether they've actually done anything!</font>

492
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They took Camie away!</font>

493
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she ends up being a slave for the rest of her life, it'll be our fault!</font>

494
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are so many human shops on the archipelago,
so we have no idea where they're taking her!</font>

495
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we don't even know who took her!</font>

496
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The archipelago is too big, but if everyone lends a hand, then maybe...</font>

497
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me where you guys are right now.</font>

498
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll meet up there.</font>

499
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? But...!</font>

500
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll contact a guy who's a pro at this stuff.</font>

501
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll call the Flying Fish Riders!</font>

502
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yahoo! It's me, Handsome!</font>

503
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's wrong!</font>

504
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Duval!</font>

505
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Duval!</font>

506
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Greetings, Master Black Leg!</font>

507
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're late, Flying Fish Riders!</font>

508
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, young master...</font>

509
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are the Rosy Life Riders!</font>

510
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care what you call yourselves! You're annoying!</font>

511
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, a mermaid was kidnapped. That's why we contacted you.</font>

512
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? So the slave-traders showed up, huh?</font>

513
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys are unBerryevable!</font>

514
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, weren't YOU slave-traders too?!</font>

515
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are so many places they could have gone to, so...</font>

516
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys! Give us a hand!</font>

517
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, of course! Thank you for your orders!</font>

518
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much!</font>

519
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will we really be alright with these guys?</font>

520
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But first, the Handsome me just went to a city where I could find some women.</font>

521
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

522
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I expected, I...</font>

523
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">couldn't get any...</font>

524
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I might have restructured your face, but I can't restructure your heart, you know.</font>

525
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't mind that! I got it, young masters!</font>

526
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just have to find that mermaid before she's sold, right?</font>

527
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. You guys should know a thing or two about the Sabaody Archipelago, right?</font>

528
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

529
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know the seas around here like our own backyard!</font>

530
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just think of it as having gotten on a really big ship!</font>

531
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, get on!</font>

532
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we are going on this flying fish?</font>

533
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, friend!</font>

534
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm counting on you!</font>

535
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gotcha!</font>

536
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, how are we gonna look for them?</font>

537
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master, people in this business have their own way of doing things.</font>

538
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We already have information on the various slave-trader teams.</font>

539
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of, we'll pick up the Straw Hats who are spread all over the Sabaody Archipelago!</font>

540
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And at the same time, we'll also track down the slave-traders who took that mermaid!</font>

541
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get going, you guys!</font>

542
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

543
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,290
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Sabaody Park</font>

544
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this really okay?</font>

545
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, what do I do?</font>

546
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, Chopper! No matter what, don't move!</font>

547
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll come get you no matter what!</font>

548
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it...</font>

549
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy! Sanji said we should stay where we...</font>

550
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In times like this, it's dangerous for us to get separated, right...</font>

551
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook?</font>

552
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too relaxed! I was really shocked!</font>

553
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie was kidnapped, you know!</font>

554
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she gets sold, she'll end up being a slave for the rest of her life!</font>

555
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper-san,...</font>

556
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-san was very specific as to what we should do next.</font>

557
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how we spend it, we will still be waiting for a certain amount of time.</font>

558
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

559
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head, we've arrived at Sabaody Park!</font>

560
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pick up each one of the Straw Hats, one by one!</font>

561
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

562
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The #5 public snail-phone should be somewhere around here.</font>

563
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it's here! There they are! Those two on that bench!</font>

564
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you two!</font>

565
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?!</font>

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you so freaking relaxed?</font>

567
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go! We're initiating our great plan to save Camie!</font>

568
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! It's time to give it our best! Let's go!</font>

569
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We... we got yelled at, Brook!</font>

570
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ashamed! I am slightly ashamed!</font>

571
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Split up and keep going! Investigate all of the slave-trading organizations.</font>

572
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Find out who did it! And don't forget to pick up the remaining Straw Hats!</font>

573
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood! We're splitting up!</font>

574
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Hurry up, Rosy-Life Riders!</font>

575
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's not a minute to lose!</font>

576
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That should do it.</font>

577
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not enough! Can't you do anything about this cow?!</font>

578
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should have gone on a flying fish too!</font>

579
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Did you just say that I'm handsome?</font>

580
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never said that! You're the damn Head, aren't you, Duval?!</font>

581
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why aren't you the fastest one in the team?!</font>

582
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying?</font>

583
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I'm the most handsome one in the team!</font>

584
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just speed this thing up, you moron!</font>

585
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we're here!</font>

586
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,100
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Meanwhile













Grove 22 Human Shop</font>

587
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure nobody tried to sell you a mermaid here?</font>

588
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure! Nobody has been here!</font>

589
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Straw Hat! If you cause a commotion, it'll just make it harder to look!</font>

590
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Squid! Let's search the store!</font>

591
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright.</font>

592
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

593
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How'd it go, squid, Pappag?</font>

594
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's not here.</font>

595
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

596
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess there's no helping it... Let's look somewhere else, Straw Hat.</font>

597
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, wait a minute. It seems that we have one mermaid here after all.</font>

598
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, there's a mermaid here?!</font>

599
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only mermaid we have here is this lady here, Marin!</font>

600
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's nice and cheap too. Want her?</font>

601
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you buy me, boy?</font>

602
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not a mermaid!</font>

603
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, aren't you that guy we saw earlier?!</font>

604
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hard to breathe in water!</font>

605
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

606
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

607
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

608
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?!</font>

609
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know if she's been sold yet... 
If only we knew who took her, at least...</font>

610
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look at that!</font>

611
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Straw Hat Luffy from East Blue!</font>

612
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! This is my fault!</font>

613
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew that the amusement park is the best spot for the slave-traders...</font>

614
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and how much they'd want to capture a mermaid...!</font>

615
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, these guys have so many types of ice-cream, huh? What do you guys want?</i></font>

616
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, let me pick one too!</i></font>

617
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Camie, wait here for a minute.</i></font>

618
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sure! Pick out a tasty one for me too.</i></font>

619
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want that to be my last conversation with Camie!</font>

620
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my fault... It's because I let her go to the amusement park...!</font>

621
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yes, because...</i></font>

622
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>this has been my dream since I was a child...</i></font>

623
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is the first time I've been to a place as high as this!</i></font>

624
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll remember it for the rest of my life! Thank you!</i></font>

625
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not sure I understand, but she was so happy!</font>

626
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was fine to bring her to the amusement park, wasn't it?!</font>

627
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it wasn't!</font>

628
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, mermen and fishmen shouldn't even be on this island in the first place.</font>

629
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

630
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Hachi just wanted to help you guys out no matter what-</font>

631
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pappag! Don't say any more!</font>

632
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he talking about? Why can't you guys be on this island?</font>

633
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie and Hachi's enemies here aren't just the slave-traders.</font>

634
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every single human living on this archipelago is an enemy!</font>

635
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">200 years ago?</font>

636
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,840
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 30
Shopping Mall</font>

637
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. Until just 200 years ago, that dark history was reality...</font>

638
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishmen and mermen were considered normal fish,</font>

639
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and were discriminated by humans all over the world.</font>

640
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone looked down upon them.</font>

641
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those strong fishmen?</font>

642
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the strongest creatures are powerless when outnumbered.</font>

643
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This continued until the World Government decided to lend a helping hand to Fishman Island 200 years ago.</font>

644
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just another piece of the dark history of the human race.</font>

645
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On this archipelago, slave-trading and selling of human lives is still acceptable.</font>

646
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I think, maybe the discrimination of mermen and fishmen is still common here, too.</font>

647
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Discrimination?</font>

648
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the fool here for not remembering that this is one island to avoid...</font>

649
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I should have stopped Camie, no matter how cruel I'd have to be...</font>

650
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, could that be the reason why Hachi and Camie had to disguise themselves on this island?</font>

651
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope I'm just reading too much into things, though.</font>

652
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,620

654
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop calling me "bratty girl"!</font>

655
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and get on the flying fish! That mermaid was kidnapped!</font>

656
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie-chan?!</font>

657
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kidnapped?!</font>

658
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie...!</font>

659
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, Straw Hat... I just wanted to help, but I ended up causing you trouble...</font>

660
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you guys saying?</font>

661
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought you did anything wrong!</font>

662
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three of you are my friends!</font>

663
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what might happen, we'll definitely save Camie!</font>

664
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So stop crying!</font>

665
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw...</font>

666
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...!</font>

667
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,780

668
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Flying Fish Riders!</font>

669

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been looking for ya... Get on!</font>

670
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, squid... Are you gonna fly too?</font>

00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be sure to get a good price for her!</font>

676
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She'll definitely catch a high price! Come back for your share later!</font>

677
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll look forward to it!</font>

680
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not mind. They may bid freely.</font>

681
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much! Well then, let me take you to the VIP seats.</font>

683
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is because he chose to ride on a lowly human.</font>

684
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he was going to ride, he should have used a fishman.</font>

685

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Compared to the "righteous" greed of the rulers,</font>

690
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the villains of the world seem much more honorable.</font>

692
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't even understand that?</font>

693
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At least we're honest about being bad people, right Killer?</font>

694
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

695
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about we buy anyone who seems interesting?</font>

696

697
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that face...</font>

698
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the 200-million man from North Blue, Trafalgar Law.</font>

699
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard some bad rumors about him.</font>

700
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,920

704
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today's big draw is a giant, right? I already know.</font>

705
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me. I'll be sure to get a good price for him.</font>

706
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are the cherry blossoms prepared yet?</font>

707
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong! It's a mermaid! A young mermaid!</font>

708
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure the bidding war will be fierce!</font>

709
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

710
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go! That hurts!</font>

711
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Hacchin!</font>

712
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, this one...! If you don't want to get hurt, then stay still!</font>

713
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, don't be so rough with such an important item!</font>

714
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,000

715
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so this is the one? The mermaid that just came in...</font>

716
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

717
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How rare! She seems lively and healthy!</font>

718
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should fetch quite the price for this one!</font>

719
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who brought her here?</font>

720
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Hound Pets.</font>

721
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Peterman, huh? He's done a great job.</font>

722
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't seem like the Flying Fish Riders brought in anything this time, though.</font>

723
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, regardless, this one should bring in a lot of money.</font>

724
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that face?!</font>

725
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...!</font>

726
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just a damn fish! Know your place!</font>

727
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Disco-san! She's an important item! If you hurt her, her value will drop!</font>

728
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have to kick her then at least, do it somewhere where her clothes will cover it, like her stomach!</font>

729
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin will definitely come and beat you up!</font>

730
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She still has the nerve to talk back to me...</font>

731
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Give me the neck ring!</font>

732
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

733
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll put this on her.</font>

734
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

736
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,060

00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,840
