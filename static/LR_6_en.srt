00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys! I see an island!</font>

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm...</font>

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like it's an uninhabited island.</font>

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ready the anchor! We'll land on the island!</font>

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, go find some foodstuffs.</font>

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen. No rats or frogs, okay?</font>

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How self-centered you are. Once it's in your stomach, it's all the same.</font>

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Chopper. Were you able to find any medicinal herbs?</font>

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep. I've collected most of them, but there may be even rarer ones on this island.</font>

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, something's been bugging me for a while.</font>

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what this weird groove is that runs down this path...</font>

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, yeah, I wonder what it is.</font>

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks as if a bicycle passed by.</font>

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey. This is an uninhabited island, right?</font>

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This can't be a trace of a bicycle when there's no one here.</font>

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true.</font>

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, we're almost through the jungle!</font>

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're suddenly out in a large open space.</font>

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh!</font>

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with Chopper?</font>

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's headed to that rock. Is there something there?</font>

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh!</font>

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That darn Chopper!</font>

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be trying to have that huge mushroom all to himself!</font>

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it!</font>

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter, Chopper?!</font>

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like something happened. Let's go!</font>

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,990

00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,510

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on a sec! Hold on, Luffy!</font>

133
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it! Stop it!</font>

134
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go! What're you guys doing?!</font>

135
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the point in us picking a fight?!</font>

136
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's one of the strongest marines!</font>

137
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what?! Then are you saying we're gonna hand over Robin without a fight?!</font>

138
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You jerk!</font>

139
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you guys... I'm saying I'm not gonna do anything, aren't I?</font>

140
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna beat him up!</font>

141
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Luffy!</font>

142
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said several times already, I took a stroll.</font>

143
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it was a stroll? Then don't go passing a place like this! Leave!</font>

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't make sense.</font>

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy kinda has the upper hand here.</font>

146
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-So you're a marine... I wish you had told us sooner.</font>

147
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are these people?</font>

148
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, get hold of yourselves.</font>

149
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then this isn't an uninhabited island?</font>

150
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, they're probably the passengers who drifted here from a wrecked ship.</font>

151
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">About a month ago, there was a report that a passenger liner went missing in this area.</font>

152
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then... Okay. I'm going back, but before that...</font>

153
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, get ready to depart right away.</font>

154
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fortunately, there's an inhabited island not so far from here.</font>

155
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should go there to get the treatment you need.</font>

156
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys! You don't have to listen to this guy! He's a marine!</font>

157
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there a problem?</font>

158
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh... That's right. It's fine, it's fine. That's right. It's fine.</font>

159
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Normally, marines are your friends and we are the bad guys, huh?</font>

160
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no time for laughing!</font>

161
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said he'd help those guys.</font>

162
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But does he have a ship?</font>

163
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides ours, I didn't see any other ships anywhere.</font>

164
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no ship. They don't have a Log Pose, either.</font>

165
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How are they supposed to go to that nearby island?</font>

166
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, they'll be fine.</font>

167
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing you say sounds convincing, you know.</font>

168
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true...</font>

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?</font>

170
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man can make it happen.</font>

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right, done!</font>

172
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We loaded up food and water. With this much, you'll be fine for a while.</font>

173
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nice to work once in a while.</font>

174
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it feels good! You're quite a sensible guy!</font>

175
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He hit it off with him after all.</font>

176
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what're you gonna do?</font>

177
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you gonna swim while pulling these guys and this stuff?</font>

178
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

179
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step back a bit.</font>

180
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What the heck?!</font>

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sea animal! I bet that's the guardian of this area of the sea!</font>

182
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Hey, you! Run!</font>

183
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out!</font>

184
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

185
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ice Age!</font>

186
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Devil Fruit...!</font>

187
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-The sea... froze!</font>

188
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the power of a Navy Headquarters' Admiral.</font>

189
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will probably last at least a week.</font>

190
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take your time and head in that direction.</font>

191
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll get to an inhabited island in four days.</font>

192
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a little cold, so dress warmly while walking.</font>

193
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this... a dream?</font>

194
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea has become ground!</font>

195
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can now cross the sea! We can get off of this island!</font>

196
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mr. Marine! Thank you!</font>

197
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a miracle! A miracle without doubt!</font>

198
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, we'll get going now.</font>

199
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. I'm happy for you guys.</font>

200
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful.</font>

201
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess there're different kinds of pirates, huh?</font>

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't thank you enough.</font>

203
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only did you treat our injured, but you also shared your food and water with us.</font>

204
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it.</font>

205
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say that even a chance meeting is due to karma from a previous life, so...</font>

206
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take good care of the children so that they don't catch a cold.</font>

207
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this state, the food will probably stay fresh for a while.</font>

208
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Bye-bye! Thank you!</font>

209
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much.</font>

210
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll never forget your kindness,Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

211
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya! Take care!</font>

212
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful on your trip!</font>

213
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good, good.</font>

214
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, it's cold. It's cold.</font>

215
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is completely like winter.</font>

216
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can ice skate!</font>

217
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! That's amazing, Chopper!</font>

218
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boy, it's cold, it's cold!</font>

219
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna freeze!</font>

220
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?</font>

221
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm...</font>

222
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

223
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I put it... You're just like your gramps, Monkey D. Luffy...</font>

224
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What?</font>

225
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're free-spirited, or should I say you're hard to figure out?</font>

226
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Gramps...</font>

227
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gramps...?! Luffy's?!</font>

228
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's the matter, Luffy? You're drenched in sweat.</font>

229
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... N-N-Nothing. Um... well...</font>

230
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your gramps really helped me out a while back.</font>

231
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason I came here was to have a look at Nico Robin and you.</font>

232
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On second thought... maybe you should die now, huh?</font>

233
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The government is still taking you guys lightly,</font>

234
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if I delve into your history, I can tell that your group has a backbone.</font>

235
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although your group is small, since it's still gathering shrewd members,</font>

236
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it'll probably become a problem later on.</font>

237
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The circumstances that initially led to your search orders...</font>

238
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All the actions you took up until now...</font>

239
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The speed of your group's progress...</font>

240
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been dealing with outlaws for a long time...</font>

241
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it worries me to think how you'll turn out.</font>

242
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-That's too sudden!</font>

243
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said earlier that you just
came to check things out!</font>

244
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason I especially regard you guys as dangerous is...</font>

245
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, Nico Robin.</font>

246
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're after Robin after all! I'm gonna beat the crap out of you!</font>

247
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her bounty amount isn't just an indication of her strength.</font>

248
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It also indicates the level of danger she poses to the government.</font>

249
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why you got a 79-million-Berry bounty on your head at the age of eight.</font>

250
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm impressed that you survived as a child.</font>

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You betrayed people and ran away. You gained people's favor and used them.</font>

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've survived in the underworld by being quick to switch sides.</font>

253
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is the group that you chose as your next hideout, huh?</font>

254
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you jerk! How insulting you are!</font>

255
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What grudge do you hold against Robin-chan?!</font>

256
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Sanji!</font>

257
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have any grudge against her.</font>

258
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we are somehow connected...</font>

259
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that I let her get away once, that's about it.</font>

260
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a long time ago.</font>

261
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys will eventually realize it, too.</font>

262
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the not-so-distant future, you'll regret that you took in a troublesome woman.</font>

263
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As proof, the organizations Nico Robin had something to do with up until today</font>

264
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all got annihilated... Except for her.</font>

265
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder why... Nico Robin?</font>

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you jerk! Her past doesn't matter!</font>

267
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... You really did a good job befriending this lot.</font>

268
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just get to the point already! If you want to capture me, go ahead and do it!</font>

269
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Treinta Fleurs!</font>

270
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin! Stop it!</font>

271
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my, my... Maybe I talked too much.</font>

272
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How disappointing!</font>

273
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had too high an opinion of you, thinking you were a little smarter than that.</font>

274
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Clutch!</font>

275
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahhh! He shattered into pieces and died!</font>

276
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No... We're screwed...</font>

277
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! Guys! Run! Let's get out of here!</font>

278
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That wasn't nice.</font>

279
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ice Saber!</font>

280
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wasn't going to kill you, but...</font>

281
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slice Shoot!</font>

282
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

283
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

284
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's cold!</font>

285
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He froze them!</font>

286
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those three... all at once...</font>

287
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Oh, no! They have to be treated right away!</font>

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they get frostbite, their limbs will become gangrenous!</font>

289
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing, Usopp?! We have to go help those three now!</font>

290
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I really would like to, but my body can't move. Did I get frozen, too?</font>

291
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! You're just too scared to move!</font>

292
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

293
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji! Zoro!</font>

294
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin! Run!</font>

295
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've come across some good friends.</font>

296
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're still you, Nico Robin!</font>

297
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...! I'm no longer...</font>

298
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin! Watch out! Run!</font>

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm...</font>

300
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan!</font>

301
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

302
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

303
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't yell... She'll still live if you defrost her carefully.</font>

304
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But her body has become fragile, so be careful.</font>

305
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If her body is broken, she'll die.</font>

306
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For example...</font>

307
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you smash it like this...</font>

308
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

309
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

310
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!!</font>

311
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?</font>

312
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close...</font>

313
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job!</font>

314
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing, Usopp!</font>

315
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell...?</font>

316
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp! Chopper!</font>

317
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run to the ship! Treat Robin and save her!</font>

318
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Got it!</font>

319
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up...! But gently, okay?</font>

320
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's cold!</font>

321
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot! Think of how cold Robin is!</font>

322
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't bother...</font>

323
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be better for the world not to save that woman.</font>

324
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not to split hairs, but a pirate group is a collection of people like that.</font>

325
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got that right, lady.</font>

326
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way, would you?</font>

327
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

328
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't...</font>

329
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just let you...</font>

330
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you two!</font>

331
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't interfere. I wanna fight him in a duel.</font>

332
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us settle this fight, just you and me!</font>

333
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's fine...</font>

334
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...but since I don't have a ship to take you back in, I'll kill you, okay?</font>

335
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She... can't breathe, can she?</font>

336
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think she's probably in a state of suspended animation.</font>

337
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-Then won't she die if we don't hurry up?</font>

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we warm her rapidly, her body will break.</font>

339
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to restore her body temperature from the inside.</font>

340
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is this really gonna work?</font>

341
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know... but this is the only way...</font>

342
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't just say you don't know! Robin's life depends on you!!</font>

343
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I've never seen a human whose entire body got frozen like this!</font>

344
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, Aokiji said she was still alive,</font>

345
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but to me, it's surprising that she's still alive!</font>

346
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't whine! If you can't do anything, then no one can save her!</font>

347
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the doctor on this ship!</font>

348
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that! Just shut your mouth for a while!</font>

349
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

350
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah... What?! Why?! Just the three of you?!</font>

351
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll explain it later!</font>

352
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go back right away!</font>

353
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do something about our frozen arm and leg!</font>

354
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ahh, okay. Let's see...</font>

355
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to melt those frozen areas with water immediately.</font>

356
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we're using the shower room for Robin right now.</font>

357
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is she okay?!</font>

358
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too early to tell.</font>

359
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

360
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So will this do?</font>

361
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you melt the ice at low temperature, come up to the ship while rubbing the affected parts!</font>

362
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami! Help us treat Robin!</font>

363
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

364
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you guys here? Where's Luffy?! What about Aokiji?!</font>

365
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy said he wanted a duel.</font>

366
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A duel?! And you guys left Luffy there by himself?!</font>

367
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those were the captain's orders.</font>

368
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Even if it was the captain's order, you can't just do that!</font>

369
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you guys a little too cold-hearted?! Luffy is...</font>

370
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

371
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a duel. Can't you understand?!</font>

372
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it! This is no time for that!</font>

373
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're... in a crisis right now.</font>

374
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether this decision is his passing whim or whatever,</font>

375
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">if anything should happen, be prepared to respond to that!</font>

376
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought, you're an odd one.</font>

377
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

378
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Storm!</font>

379
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ice Time...</font>

380
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let us settle this fight, just you and me!</i></font>

381
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darn... I was tricked.</font>

382
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since I accepted the duel, this fight ends when I win.</font>

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I see...</font>

384
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I mess with the others now, I'd be the senseless one here...</font>

385
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Captain?</font>

386
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or...</font>

387
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you seriously intend to defeat me?</font>

388
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me say this.</font>

389
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the future, Nico Robin will grow...</font>

390
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman will definitely grow to be too much for you to handle.</font>

391
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys will no longer be able to shoulder the burden of the brutal fate</font>

392
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that Nico Robin was born into.</font>

393
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what it means...</font>

394
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to let her on your ship...</font>

395
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

396
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Breaking you right here, right now and killing you would be very easy,</font>

397
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we owe you one.</font>

398
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This settles our debt to you for defeating Crocodile.</font>

399
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also...</font>

400
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Err... Well, I guess I don't have to talk about that idiot Smoker.</font>

401
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See you around!</font>

402
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

403
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

404
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't get broken into pieces!</font>

405
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good, good...</font>

406
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lets carry him!</font>

407
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry to the ship!</font>

408
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't talk at the same time!</font>

409
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to this island's log, their next destination is...</font>

410
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?</font>

411
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Water Seven... The city of water, huh?</font>

412
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my, my... They're really getting closer to our Headquarters.</font>

413
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oops, sorry about that.</font>

414
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both of them...</font>

415
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their hearts...</font>

416
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...started beating!</font>

417
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

418
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

419
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan!</font>

420
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! You can't go in yet!</font>

421
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll make a racket, right?</font>

422
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Dr. Chopper. I'll make something for them.</font>

423
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You calling me "doctor" wouldn't make me feel happy, you jerk!</font>

424
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, when they wake up, some drinks that can warm them up would be good.</font>

425
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll carry them to the lounge later.</font>

426
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aye-aye, sir!</font>

427
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, are we gonna sail out?</font>

428
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, we aren't, with our captain like that.</font>

429
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already got the log, but let's stay here for today.</font>

430
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?</font>

431
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter, Usopp? Are you feeling drained?</font>

432
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if strong guys like him are coming after us from now on...</font>

433
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I did was get flustered.</font>

434
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get some sleep, you idiot. You're exhausted.</font>
