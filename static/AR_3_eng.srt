62
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He wanted to see Captain Arlong,

63

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That means there's no reason

64

65
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He said he was a guest
of yours, you see.</font>

66
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And I didn't think you'd be
back so soon, Arlong...</font>

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Zoro, huh?!</font>

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That means I just need to
buy myself a little more time...</font>

69

71
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So close...!</font>

72

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">D-Damn it! You wanna fight?!</font>

73

79

80

to his face like that?!</font>

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The only thing I trust is money.</font>

82
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,500

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,790

84

go off without a hitch.</font>

92

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There's only one reason
I joined this crew!</font>

117
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">To buy Cocoyashi Village!</font>

118
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Keep your end of the deal!</font>

119
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll have the 100 million berries soon!</font>

120
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Of course.</font>

121
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'd rather gut myself than

126
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's really coming into her own!</font>

127
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,620

131
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, Big Bro Sanji's kicks
must've really taken their toll!</font>

To the left! That building!</font>

133
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's almost like we're flying!</font>

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Not "almost like"!</font>

135

137
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We landed!</font>

138
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! Zoro!</font>

139
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We made it! We made it!</font>

We're here to get Nami.</font>

143
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You haven't found her yet?</font>

144

Usopp and Johnny?</font>

on this sea can challenge us!</font>

249
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">And let's not forget Nami's sea charts.</font>

250
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,500

good charts, alright!</font>

oceans, we'll be kings of the sea forever!</font>

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Indeed, she's the key
to creating the Arlong Empire!</font>

253
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's a real shame!</font>

254
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">A shame?</font>

255
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He made a deal to let Nami
and Cocoyashi Village go</font>

256
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">once she saves up 100 million berries.</font>

257
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Are you serious, Captain Arlong?!</font>

258
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're really gonna let Nami go?!</font>

259
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I have no choice.</font>

260
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's what we agreed to
eight years ago.</font>

261
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">When it comes to money, I'd rather
die than go back on my word.</font>

262
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Say that again, and I'll kick your ass!</font>

263
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Stop, Luffy. This has nothing
to do with Johnny.</font>

264
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you don't wanna
believe me, then don't!</font>

265
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But I know what I saw!</font>

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She killed Big Bro Usopp–</font>

267
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Shut up!</font>

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!</font>

269
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">She's one of us!</font>

270
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">But, I...!</font>

271
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One of who now, Luffy?</font>

272
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami!</font>

273
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why are you here?</font>

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What do you mean?</font>

275
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're one of us!
We came to get you!</font>

276
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You're such a pain.</font>

277
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami?</font>

278
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">One of you?</font>

279
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't make me laugh!</font>

280
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You barely even function as a group.</font>

281
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You witch! You've got some nerve!</font>

282
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I saw it with my own eyes!</font>

283
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How dare...!</font>

284
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">How dare you kill Big Bro Usopp!</font>

285
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Big deal.</font>

286
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why not kill me and
take your revenge, then?</font>

287
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?!</font>

288
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let me give you a heads up.</font>

289
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Right now, Arlong wants to kill
Roronoa Zoro and his men.</font>

290
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Zoro just had to go
and do something stupid.</font>

291
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No matter how monstrously
powerful you are,</font>

292
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">you're no match for <i>real</i> monsters.</font>

293
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hi, Nami! It's me!
Do you remember me?!</font>

294
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Let's set sail together!</font>

295
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Shut your mouth!
You're just complicating things!</font>

296
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The hell?!</font>

297
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Love is always a hurricane!</font>

298
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey! Listen when someone's talking!</font>

299
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Where's Usopp?</font>

300
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">At the bottom of the sea.</font>

301
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Damn it! Cut the crap!</font>

302
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So swordsmen don't mind
striking ladies, Roronoa Zoro?</font>

303
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What?! You don't even know
what's going on here! Back off!</font>

304
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I guess I'd be irritated too,
after getting my ass kicked.</font>

305
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey!</font>

306
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Watch that mouth of yours!</font>

307
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Mind your damn business, asshole!</font>

308
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Big Bros! This is no time
for you two to be going at it!</font>

309
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That's right!</font>

310
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If you're gonna fight,
can you do it off the island?!</font>

311
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Don't butt any more
into our affairs, outsiders!</font>

312
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You still don't get it, do you?</font>

313
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The one and only reason I got
close to you was for the money!</font>

314
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Now that you're broke,
I'm not interested whatsoever!</font>

315
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You can have your ship back,</font>

316
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">so go find another navigator
to get you to the Grand Line!</font>

317
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Go look for your
One Piece or whatever!</font>

318
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Just get lost!
I'm sick of looking at you!</font>

319
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Goodbye.</font>

320
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami...</font>

321
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Big Bro Luffy?!</font>

322
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nap time.</font>

323
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nap time?!</font>

324
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">At a time like this?!
In the middle of the road?!</font>

325
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm not going anywhere...</font>

326
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">and I'm not interested in
what's happening on this island.</font>

327
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm just a little sleepy.</font>

328
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So I'm taking a nap.</font>

329
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?!</font>

330
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Fine...</font>

331
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Fine! Whatever! Die, for all I care!</font>

332
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Na–</font>

333
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey, Big Bro Zoro!</font>

334
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What the heck are you thinking?!</font>

335
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Arlong is out to kill us!</font>

336
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Why aren't we running away?!</font>

337
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Now that we know what
Nami's really like,</font>

338
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">there's no reason
to stay on this island!</font>

339
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">F-Fine!</font>

340
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It was a short reunion,
but our role as guides ends here!</font>

341
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I agree! I'm not trying
to get myself killed!</font>

342
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah.</font>

343
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Take care.</font>

344
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Well, until we meet again!</font>

345
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Be well, you guys!</font>

346
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You, too!</font>

347
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Hey.</font>

348
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?</font>

349
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do you honestly believe
Nami killed Long Nose?</font>

350
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Back there...</font>

351
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>I have a job to finish.</i></font>

352
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>This was my only choice!</i></font>

353
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Back there...</font>

354
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami stabbed her own hand
to make it look like she stabbed me!</font>

355
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If it weren't for Nami,
Arlong would've killed me for sure!</font>

356
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What should I do?!</font>

357
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">The Manly Usopp can't just
turn tail after being saved!</font>

358
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">For now, I gotta hurry and find Zoro!</font>

359
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Wait... Is that him?!</font>

360
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It is! Alright!</font>

361
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami didn't kill him.
Is that what you're trying to say?</font>

362
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Am I wrong?</font>

363
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Who can say?</font>

364
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I did tell her that she's just a little girl
who can't even watch one guy die.</font>

365
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Maybe that made her mad.</font>

366
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Whad'ya mean, "little girl"?!</font>

367
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Does her chest look
like a little girl's to you?!</font>

368
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Is that all you think–</font>

369
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He's alive!</font>

370
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><font color="#050707">No, I think he's dead now...</font></font>

371
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You sure know how to trash a place.</font>

372
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What's wrong, Nami?</font>

373
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nothing. I'm just here to rest a little.</font>

374
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Breaking glass and furniture
just to rest is a bit much.</font>

375
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">If nothing's wrong, why are you
staring at that treasure map?</font>

376
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">We agreed that you can tell me
anything, remember?</font>

377
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Something just made
me mad. That's all!</font>

378
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, them. Who are they anyway...?</font>

379
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You met them?!</font>

380
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah. Captain Something-or-Other.</font>

381
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">He kinda seemed like a liar, though.</font>

382
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I get it now...</font>

383
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah, that'd hit you hard.</font>

384
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm surprised that someone
actually showed up to get her back.</font>

385
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Friends, huh...?</font>

386
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That word...</font>

387
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">for her...</font>

388
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No word could be more painful...</font>

389
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Usopp!</font>

390
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Did Nami do this to you?!</font>

391
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Sorry. That was me and this guy.</font>

392
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82"><i>You</i> did it!</font>

393
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">L-Luffy! You're here?!</font>

394
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Yeah. We just got here.</font>

395
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh, I'm here, too! Nice to see you!</font>

396
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Someday I'm gonna kill you!</font>

397
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Oh! You're in pretty
good shape, after all!</font>

398
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Shut up!</font>

399
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Speaking of which,
we heard Nami killed you.</font>

400
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Huh?!</font>

401
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">That damn Johnny!
I knew he was full of it!</font>

402
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No...</font>

403
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">In a way, it wasn't a lie.</font>

404
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's actually the opposite!</font>

405
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami saved my life!</font>

406
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There must be some reason
she's in that fishman crew!</font>

407
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No kidding.</font>

408
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">So, what do we do?</font>

409
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Do we storm Arlong Park?</font>

410
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">H-Hold on! We gotta find out
what the story with Nami is first!</font>

411
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Either way, it's a waste of time.</font>

412
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?</font>

413
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">No matter what you guys do,
you can't get rid of Arlong.</font>

414
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nojiko!</font>

415
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Who's she?</font>

416
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami's big sister.</font>

417
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">N-Nami's older sister?!
No wonder she's such a beauty!</font>

418
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">What do you mean "a waste of time"?</font>

419
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Please, don't involve yourselves
any further with this village.</font>

420
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Leave Nami alone.</font>

421
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'll explain what's going on.</font>

422
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You'll want to leave
the island once you hear it.</font>

423
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">There's a Marine ship at the shore?!</font>

424
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">It's a ship from the 16th Branch!</font>

425
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Maybe headquarters is taking action</font>

426
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">after what happened
to the 77th Branch!</font>

427
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I am Captain Nezumi
of the 16th Marine Branch.</font>

428
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Bring me Genzo, sheriff
of Cocoyashi Village!</font>

429
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">I'm Genzo, Captain.</font>

430
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You, huh?</font>

431
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Take me to the home
of the girl named Nami.</font>

432
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">Nami? But what in the world for?</font>

433
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="82">You simply need to lead the way.</font>
