<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So, where did Zoro go?!</font>

57
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He wanted to see Arlong, so I took
him to Cocoyashi Village just now!</font>

58
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That means there's no reason
to rush out and find him.</font>

59

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,850

of yours, you see.</font>

61
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And I didn't think you'd be
back so soon, Arlong.</font>

62
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro, huh?!</font>

63
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Then, I just need to buy 
myself a little more time.</font>

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,070

72

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy didn't suspect you one bit!</font>

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Even now, he completely trusts you!</font>

74
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How can you be so indifferent 
about tricking someone like that?!</font>

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Money's the only thing I trust.

76
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Say what?!</font>

77

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,350

you down with my own hand!</font>

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Put me down?</font>

82
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You, off me?!
Don't make me laugh!</font>

83
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,500

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yo! Zoro!</font>

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We made it! We made it!</font>

128
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What the hell... 
are you guys doing?!</font>

129
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What do you mean?
We're here to get Nami.</font>

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh yeah. Where are
Usopp and Johnny?</font>

131
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Usopp!</font>

132
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Th-That's right!</font>

133
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's no time to be
loafing around here!</font>

134
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's wrong?!</font>

135
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That bastard's been caught by Arlong!</font>

136
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We gotta hurry before he's killed!</font>

137
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're too late!</font>

138
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

139
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Usopp is dead!</font>

140
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He was killed!</font>

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">By Big Sis Nami!</font>

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– Hurry! Hurry!
– What's the big deal?!</font>

143
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's the Navy! The Navy's here!</font>

144
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Some survivors from Gosa managed
to contact the government!</font>

145
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The Navy's come here to pick us up!</font>

146
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">See!</font>

147
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're saved!</font>

148
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We can finally escape this island!</font>

149
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So that's the infamous Arlong Park?</font>

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Pirates settling down so brazenly
is surely a sign of the end times.</font>

151
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Listen up, men!</font>

152
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our mission today is to liberate 
the survivors of Gosa,</font>

153
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">the town destroyed
by the Arlong Pirates!</font>

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But I am left to wonder...</font>

155
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Would our brand of justice allow 
us to overlook the castle...</font>

156
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">of this unchecked pirate?!</font>

157
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It would not!</font>

158
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our unit is to annihilate
Arlong and his men!</font>

159
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Prepare for battle at once!</font>

160
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yes, sir!</font>

161
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Navy Branch 77?</font>

162
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yes. That's what it said.</font>

163
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A newcomer.</font>

164
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Someone go and negotiate
with the one in charge.</font>

165
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If two million isn't enough to keep
them from trying anything funny,</font>

166
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">get rid of 'em!</font>

167
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's a surprise attack!</font>

168
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong! Look out!</font>

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">H-He pulverized that cannonball!</font>

170
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">His bite is terrifying!</font>

171
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong. The negotiations?</font>

172
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Canceled.</font>

173
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– All right! Let's go!
– Time to fight!</font>

174
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It'll be a Navy bloodbath!</font>

175
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Not so fast, guys.</font>

176
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We don't need to waste so much
effort just to take out the trash.</font>

177
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,580
<font face="Roboto" size="26"><font size="25"><font color="#000000">Officer Chew

181
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We'll go!</font>

182
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">These humans are damn fools to pick
a fight with us in these waters.</font>

183
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Three of our officers'll
make for an epic fight!</font>

184
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That ship won't last
even three minutes!</font>

185
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's odd.</font>

186
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Commodore! The cannonball
appears to have been a dud!</font>

187
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Fire another! We must demonstrate 
our intent to fight!</font>

188
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're dealing with fishmen!
Don't let your guard down, men!</font>

189
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yes, sir!</font>

190
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's been hit!
It's one of Arlong's men!</font>

191
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get him! Commence attack!</font>

192
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop! Remain calm!</font>

193
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're one of Arlong's men, yes?</font>

194
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I am Commodore Pudding Pudding
of Navy Branch 77.</font>

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We are a somewhat
well-known elite naval unit!</font>

196
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you do not wish for death,
I suggest you dutifully surrender–</font>

197
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Commodore!</font>

198
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– How dare you!
– Kill him!</font>

199
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What caused that impact?!</font>

200
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't tell me there's
fishmen under the ship?!</font>

201
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm sorry to bother you like this,</font>

202
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but we just took the liberty
of removing your ship's rudder.</font>

203
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What?!</font>

204
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Commodore!</font>

205
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you all right?!</font>

206
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't worry.
I didn't hit any vital organs.</font>

207
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is just hypothetical, Commodore,</font>

208
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but if one were to move a massive 
rock directly into a strong current,</font>

209
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">what do you suppose would 
happen to the ocean?</font>

210
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

211
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">M-Moving rocks underwater?!
That can't be possible!</font>

212
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">All right! Right around there, Hachi!</font>

213
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Okay!</font>

214
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">C-Commodore!</font>

215
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A giant whirlpool has 
suddenly appeared ahead!</font>

216
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The rudder's not working!</font>

217
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

218
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I told you. We removed the rudder.</font>

219
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This rudderless ship is now headed...</font>

220
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">into the depths of the sea.</font>

221
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This can't be happening...</font>

222
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's the reality.</font>

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's no way we can escape 
from Arlong's control.</font>

224
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Thanks for that.</font>

225
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It was nothing.</font>

226
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We know everything
about these waters,</font>

227
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">from the winds to the depths.</font>

228
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It was a cinch.</font>

229
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">With our top-notch skills, no one 
in these seas can challenge us!</font>

230
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And let's not forget
Nami's sea charts.</font>

231
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I moved the rock after checking that!</font>

232
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It even tells the flow of
the currents and everything!</font>

233
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Those are some damn 
good charts, all right!</font>

234
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If we have Nami draw up charts
of all the world's oceans,</font>

235
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">we'll be the eternal
kings of the sea!</font>

236
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami's definitely vital in the creation 
of the Arlong Empire!</font>

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's a real shame!</font>

238
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">A shame?</font>

239
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He promised to let Nami
and Cocoyashi Village go,</font>

240
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">once she saves up 100 million belly.</font>

241
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">For real, Arlong?!</font>

242
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're really going to let Nami go?!</font>

243
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">For reals, for reals?!
That's a big waste!</font>

244
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I have no choice.</font>

245
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's what we agreed
to eight years ago.</font>

246
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:02,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">When it comes to money, I'd rather
die than go back on my promises.</font>

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Try saying that again!
I'll kick your ass!</font>

248
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop, Luffy. This has nothing 
to do with Johnny.</font>

249
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you don't wanna
believe me, then don't!</font>

250
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But I saw it with my own two eyes!</font>

251
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She killed Big Bro Usopp–</font>

252
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Quit spouting nonsense!
Nami would never kill Usopp!</font>

253
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're friends!</font>

254
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">B-But, I...</font>

255
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who're friends, Luffy?</font>

256
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

257
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why are you here?</font>

258
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What're you talking about?</font>

259
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're one of us!
We came to get you!</font>

260
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're a big problem.</font>

261
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami?</font>

262
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">One of you?
Don't make me laugh!</font>

263
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're just a pathetic band
that looks out for one another.</font>

264
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Damn you! You killed him!
I saw it with my own eyes!</font>

265
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare... How dare
you kill Big Bro Usopp!</font>

266
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So what? Why not take your
revenge and kill me, then?</font>

267
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

268
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll tell you this much.</font>

269
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Right now, Arlong wants to kill
Roronoa Zoro and his men.</font>

270
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro just had to go and
do something stupid.</font>

271
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No matter how monstrously
powerful you are,</font>

272
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">you're no match for real monsters.</font>

273
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you hang around here,
you will wind up getting killed.</font>

274
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Not that it matters to me, though.</font>

275
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She's enchanting even 
when she's standoffish!</font>

276
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hi, Nami! It's me!
Do you remember me?!</font>

277
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let's set sail together!</font>

278
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Shut up, you!
You're just complicating things!</font>

279
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Say what?!
Love is always a hurricane!</font>

280
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! Listen when people are talking!</font>

281
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Where's Usopp?</font>

282
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">On the ocean floor.</font>

283
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Damn it! Cut the crap!</font>

284
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A swordsman would even
strike a lady, Roronoa Zoro?</font>

285
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?! You don't even know
what's going on here! Back off!</font>

286
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I guess I'd be irritated too,
coming right off a humiliating defeat.</font>

287
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh?!</font>

288
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, watch that mouth of yours!</font>

289
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Mind your damn business, asshole!</font>

290
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bros! This is no time for
you two to be going at it!</font>

291
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's right!</font>

292
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you're going to fight,
could you do it off the island?!</font>

293
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't butt any more into
our affairs, outsiders!</font>

294
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You still don't get it, do you?</font>

295
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The one and only reason I got
close to you was for the money!</font>

296
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now that you're flat broke,
I'm not interested whatsoever!</font>

297
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You can have your ship back,</font>

298
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so go find another navigator
and go to the Grand Line!</font>

299
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Go look for your
One Piece or whatever!</font>

300
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just get the hell out of here!
You're an eyesore!</font>

301
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Goodbye.</font>

302
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami.</font>

303
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro Luffy?!</font>

304
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm going to sleep.</font>

305
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Sleep?!</font>

306
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">At a time like this?!
And right in the middle of the road?!</font>

307
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't plan on leaving,</font>

308
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and I'm not interested in
what's happening here.</font>

309
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And I'm a little sleepy.</font>

310
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm going to sleep.</font>

311
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?!</font>

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">B-Big Bro.</font>

313
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Fine...</font>

314
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Fine, whatever!
Go ahead and die!</font>

315
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Na– Uh...</font>

316
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Big Bro Zoro!
What the heck are you thinking?!</font>

317
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong is out to kill us!</font>

318
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So why aren't we running away?!</font>

319
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now that we know what
Nami's really like,</font>

320
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">there should be no reason
at all to stay on this island!</font>

321
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A reason for staying on this island?
There is one.</font>

322
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's staying here.</font>

323
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't tell us you're still gonna try
to get her back too, Big Bro Zoro?!</font>

324
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I have nothing to do with it.</font>

325
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He decides who we have 
as our navigator.</font>

326
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Big Bro.</font>

327
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A-All right! Understood!</font>

328
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It was a short reunion,
but our role as guides ends here!</font>

329
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I agree! I'm not trying
to get myself killed!</font>

330
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. Take care.</font>

331
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Well, until we meet again!</font>

332
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Be well, you guys!</font>

333
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You, too!</font>

334
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Back there...</font>

335
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>It's for my business!</i></font>

336
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>This was my only choice!</i></font>

337
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Back there,</font>

338
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami stabbed her own hand to 
make it look like she stuck me!</font>

339
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If Nami hadn't done that for me,
Arlong would've killed me for sure!</font>

340
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What should I do?!</font>

341
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Manly Usopp can't just turn
tail after being saved!</font>

342
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">For now, I gotta hurry and find Zoro!</font>

343
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is that... Zoro?!</font>

344
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It is! Yes!</font>

345
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami didn't kill him.</font>

346
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is that what you're tryin' to say?</font>

347
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Am I wrong?</font>

348
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I wonder.</font>

349
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I told her that she's a lightweight who
couldn't ever walk out on anyone.</font>

350
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She might've done it
out of frustration.</font>

351
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Whad'ya mean, "a lightweight"?!</font>

352
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's so lightweight
about Nami's chest?!</font>

353
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is that all you can think–</font>

354
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's alive!</font>

355
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No, I think he's dead now.</font>

356
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You really know how to trash a place.</font>

357
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's wrong, Nami?</font>

358
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nothing. I'm just
here to rest a little.</font>

359
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Breaking glass and furniture
just to rest is a bit much.</font>

360
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You have that treasure map open
even though nothing's wrong?</font>

361
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We agreed you could tell me
anything, remember?</font>

362
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Something just made
me mad, that's all!</font>

363
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It was them, huh? Who are they?</font>

364
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You met them?!</font>

365
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. Captain...
something-or-other.</font>

366
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He kinda seemed like a liar, though.</font>

367
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now I see.</font>

368
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah, that'd hit you hard.</font>

369
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm surprised that someone
really showed up for her.</font>

370
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Friends, huh?</font>

371
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:06,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The most painful word for her.</font>

372
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Usopp!</font>

373
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did Nami do this to you?!</font>

374
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sorry. Me and this guy did that.</font>

375
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You did it!</font>

376
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">L-Luffy! You're here?!</font>

377
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. We just got here.</font>

378
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, I'm here, too!
Good to see you!</font>

379
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Someday I'm gonna kill you!</font>

380
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh! You're in pretty 
good shape, after all!</font>

381
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Shut up!</font>

382
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Speaking of which,
we heard Nami killed you.</font>

383
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh?!</font>

384
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That damn Johnny! I knew it! 
He was full of crap!</font>

385
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No. In a way, it wasn't a lie.</font>

386
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's actually the opposite!
Nami saved my life!</font>

387
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It looks to me like there's a reason
she's in a fishman crew!</font>

388
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Obviously.</font>

389
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So, what do we do?
Do we storm Arlong Park?</font>

390
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">H-Hold on! We gotta find out what 
the story with Nami is first!</font>

391
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's no use, either way.</font>

392
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No matter what you guys do,
Arlong's rule won't come to an end.</font>

393
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko!</font>

394
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who's she?</font>

395
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami's big sister.</font>

396
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">N-Nami's older sister?!
No wonder she's so beautiful!</font>

397
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What do you mean it's no use?</font>

398
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Please, don't get any more
involved with this village.</font>

399
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave Nami alone.</font>

400
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll explain the circumstances.</font>

401
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Circumstances?</font>

402
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You mean why she
joined Arlong's group?</font>

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yes. You'll feel like leaving
the island once you hear it.</font>

404
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's a Navy ship at the shore?!</font>

405
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's a ship from the 16th Branch!</font>

406
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Maybe Headquarters is taking action,</font>

407
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">after what happened
to the 77th Branch!</font>

408
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I am Captain Nezumi
of Navy Branch 16.</font>

409
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bring me Genzo, the representative
of Cocoyashi Village!</font>

410
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm Genzo, Captain.</font>

411
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You, huh?</font>

412
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Lead me to the house
of the girl named Nami.</font>

413
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami? But what in the world for?</font>

414
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You simply need to lead the way.</font>
