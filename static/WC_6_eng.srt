128
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,840

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you still cook for rats?
Royalty mustn't offer services!</font>

130
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How embarrassing!</font>

131
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's ridiculous.</font>

132
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What problem do you have with this marriage?!</font>

is a thing of the past now!</font>

144
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, hey...</font>

145
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can I ask you something?</font>

146
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think being a biological parent
entitles someone to respect?</font>

147
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't...</font>

155
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wall!</font>

156
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys, move!</font>

157

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're tough as nails. I'm surprised.</font>

160
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe you're
that weak little Sanji.</font>

161
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is getting ridiculous.</font>

162
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna attend the tea party
and get out of here already.</font>

163
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'm gonna be free from
the curse of Big Mom's invitation.</font>

164
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you might've changed a little,
but you've actually gotten worse!</font>

165
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of this room, old man!
You're a stranger to me!</font>

166
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you have my blood in your veins.</font>

167
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get me wrong.
All Germa soldiers are...</font>

168
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">followers who are willing to die 
for the Vinsmoke family at a moment's notice!</font>

169
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're Germa's biggest military force!</font>

170
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, why don't you use them 
to make your stupid dream come true?</font>

171
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Conquering the North Blue? Great!
That's perfect for an evil organization.</font>

172
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're quick on the uptake.
That's right.</font>

173
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By joining hands with Big Mom,</font>

174
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it'll become an objective
I can achieve for sure!</font>

175
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An objective... I can achieve for sure!</font>

176
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can understand that,
I have nothing left to say.</font>

177
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to somehow settle this 
with you peacefully, but...</font>

178
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need Big Mom's help,
but the condition is establishing blood ties.</font>

179
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a marriage,</font>

180
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I can't let any of my precious sons
marry someone from that crazy old bag's family!</font>

181
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I remembered... I have another son...</font>

182
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who was a failure.</font>

183
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are a sacrifice, Sanji.</font>

184
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't changed.</font>

185
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think of you as my son even one bit!</font>

186
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are these?</font>

187

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said your hands are important to you.{Flashback from WCI11 @timestamp 11:52}</font>

188
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great.</font>

189
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know the shackle collars
that the Celestial Dragons' slaves wear?</font>

190
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they try to escape from their masters,
they'll explode along with their heads.</font>

191
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those work the same way.</font>

192

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you try to escape this island,
your hands will be blown off!{Flashback from WCI 11 @ timestamp 11:55}</font>

193
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Screw you! Take them off!</font>

194
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom had the foresight to lend them to me.</font>

195
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She has the key.</font>

196
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

197
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do that.</font>

198
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't try to rip them off.</font>

199
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Using the key is the only way
to take them off, of course.</font>

200
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't escape.</font>

201
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, first of all,</font>

207
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe betrayed us?!</font>

208
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This happened between him and Mama yesterday?</font>

209
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe was so cool
when he stopped Mama's tantrum.</font>

210
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He blustered that he
wanted to leave her crew,</font>

211
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he got scared of paying
the price and backed down!</font>

212
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah? That's pathetic!</font>

213
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a loser!</font>

214
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess "Knight of the Sea" is only a title.
I've lost respect for him.</font>

215
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he was a coward and a traitor.</font>

216
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-<i>san</i>...</font>

217
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know you were working under Big Mom.</font>

218
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why Fishman Island
was protected by Big Mom.</font>

219
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe is a former warlord, isn't he?</font>

220
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe someone of his stature is her subordinate.</font>

221
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook, do you know this man?</font>

222
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, he's a very important person to us.</font>

225
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,650

the offer to join our crew that day,</font>

226
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">because he wanted to fulfill

It doesn't sound like something he'd do.</font>

228
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won't come and join us anymore?</font>

229
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook!</font>

230
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please! I have to go somewhere!</font>

235
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about this dress?</font>

236
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, it looks good on you!</font>

237
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about this one? I knew it, Madam Pudding!
It looks wonderful!</font>

238
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything looks good on you!</font>

240
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um...</font>

241
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madam Pudding,
do you know what the groom likes?</font>

242
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!
No! I've only met him once, so...</font>

243
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaaat?!</font>

244
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, Pudding-<i>san</i>,
what is she doing here?!</font>

245
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess she got caught by her attendants.</font>

246
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I assumed she'd already led Sanji-<i>san</i> out</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to meet with Luffy-<i>san</i> and the others by now.</font>

248
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looking at this, I bet Sanji 
doesn't even know that we're here.</font>

249
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, who did Luffy-<i>san</i> see at the shore?</font>

250
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.
Maybe he just saw someone else.</font>

251
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's... If I'm not mistaken,
he was on Big Mom's ship...</font>

252
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I know him very well.</font>
