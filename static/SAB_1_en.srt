00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this really okay with you?</font>

42
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, about Ace's paper, huh?</font>

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine. Don't worry about it.</font>

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-san, I would have no objections if you wished to take a detour!</font>

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time is of no great importance to Laboon and myself!</font>

47
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To "live" and "meet once more"... That is all that matters!</font>

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, we're all totally fine if you want to take a detour!</font>

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine, it's fine!</font>

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Let's go see your whale of a brother!</font>

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's fine, really!</font>

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he was in some kind of trouble, he wouldn't want me to worry...</font>

53
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace hates being made to look weak!</font>

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we went to help him, he'd just get pissed off.</font>

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we do meet up, it'll be as enemy pirates!</font>

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace has his own adventure.</font>

57
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That "Vivre Card" apparently doesn't just shrink when the owner's in bad condition...</font>

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It goes back to how it was once they recover.</font>

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! If we meet, it'll be at that time.</font>

60
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why Ace gave me this paper, right?</font>

61
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and Zoro!</font>

62
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were asleep all along, so we haven't done this yet!</font>

63
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, let's do it properly then!</font>

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To celebrate the recruitment of our new companion, the musician Brook...</font>

65
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers!</font>

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most obliged!</font>

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Pull in the sails! We'll launch our way out of here with the Coup de Burst!</font>

68
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Burst!</font>

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?!</font>

70
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,760
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Holy Land, Mariejoa</font>

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

72
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartholomew Kuma, are you telling me that they managed to escape from your powers?!</font>

73
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want a better explanation than that! I'm the one who has to report this to the higher-ups!</font>

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what I expected from my grandson!</font>

75
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Garp, be quiet!</font>

76
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were given a special Government order to eliminate the whole crew,</font>

77
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">yet you couldn't even bring back Straw Hat Luffy's head? This is a disgrace!</font>

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about that, Sengoku!</font>

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy isn't the kind of guy who would go around bragging about defeating Moriah anyway!</font>

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmph!</font>

81
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kuma, I hope you didn't take pity on those pirates just because they were injured.</font>

82
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because you've failed to take this seriously, this game of cat-and-mouse will have no end.</font>

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they continue blindly following the Log, as they are now, they will draw ever closer to the Navy HQ.</font>

84
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah, by the way... I brought the new tea!</font>

85
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out the crackers!</font>

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Garp, will you be quiet?!</font>

87
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,310
<font face="impress bt" size="45">A few days later</font>

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,870
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grand Line</font>

89
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,480
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Thousand Sunny</font>

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serpent currents!</font>

91
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serpent... currents?</font>

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, be careful!</font>

93
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, everyone!</font>

94
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Burst!</font>

96
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're here...</font>

97
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've finally made it this far!</font>

98
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels kind of nostalgic...</font>

99
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see the top! It's huge!</font>

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is the Red Line?</font>

101
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if we've matured since then?</font>

102
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I kinda feel like crying!</font>

103
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A lot of stuff has happened, huh?</font>

104
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyways, now we're halfway there!</font>

105
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Twin Capes on the other side of the world, where we met Laboon, is connected to this spot!</font>

106
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,280
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Current location</font>

107
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's great that we've all made it this far, huh?</font>

108
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was told I came over Reverse Mountain from South Blue when I was just a kid...</font>

109
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I guess that's a 30 year old tale.</font>

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came to this sea from West Blue, five years ago.</font>

111
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we've crossed the other half of the world, and see this wall again...</font>

112
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At that time...</font>

113
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be the Pirate King! {Starts Late}</font>

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we've got to be careful now.</font>

115
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is close to the "Holy Land" of the World Government and the Navy HQ, Mariejoa.</font>

116
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This "surprise-pool" is the best!</font>

117
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm too weak.</font>

118
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to become stronger!</font>

119
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still far too weak!</font>

120
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still...!</font>

121
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is it, Robin, Brook, Luffy?</font>

122
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use. It's completely black.</font>

123
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's totally black out there!</font>

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I think I saw something there!</font>

125
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was that the eyeball of a monster?</font>

126
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-a monster?</font>

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We are going to die!</font>

128
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I am already dead!</font>

129
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, by the way, Nami-san? I have a question...</font>

130
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What panties are you wearing today?</font>

131
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Take this seriously!</font>

132
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary...!</font>

133
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a plucky guy, huh?</font>

134
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys! The Shark Submerge can't go any deeper than 5,000 metres, so be careful!</font>

135
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm? The hull seems to be creaking.</font>

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it's because...</font>

137
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we're deeper than 5,000 metres right now.</font>

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that means...</font>

139
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that is terrible! We are going to be crushed by the water-pressure!</font>

140
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! The monster from earlier! It's still here!</font>

141
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a big mouth it has.</font>

142
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out!</font>

143
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna eat us!</font>

144
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes again!</font>

145
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This sounds pretty bad...</font>

146
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to ride the Shark Submerge...</font>

147
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me neither.</font>

148
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-swan!</font>

149
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The "Horror-Nashi Tarte" from Thriller Bark is done!</font>

150
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it looks good!</font>

151
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is a problem...</font>

152
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It tastes great!</font>

153
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's good!</font>

154
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the same problem we had with Sky Island.</font>

155
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right...</font>

156
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know the direction we have to take,</font>

157
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we have no idea how we're gonna get there.</font>

158
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How are we gonna reach Fishman Island?</font>

159
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're back!</font>

160
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was fun!</font>

161
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back! Good work!</font>

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

163
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't see anything on the bottom of the sea at all. Is Fishman Island really there?</font>

164
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was my first time riding a submarine.</font>

165
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we'd have gone further down, the pressure would have killed us.</font>

166
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Log Pose is certainly pointing straight down, but...</font>

167
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no good... I should have gotten some more info from Lola and the others.</font>

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that thing from earlier!</font>

169
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It followed us!</font>

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think you can beat me when we're above the water!</font>

171
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

172
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rifle!</font>

173
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somehow, he didn't seem all that huge.</font>

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because we dealt with Oars! Seems like we're fine.</font>

175
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something came out.</font>

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fish?</font>

177
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A person?!</font>

178
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that is wrong...</font>

179
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a...</font>

180
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Could it be?!</font>

181
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! I crushed a human!</font>

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry! Are you OK?</font>

183
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, don't worry about it~!</font>

184
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, who are...</font>

185
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">{\an8}Please pull yourself together! Are you OK?</font>

186
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

187
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">{\an8}I can't believe I did something like that! Please pull yourself together!</font>

188
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fin...</font>

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,620

190
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mermaid?!</font>

191
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a shock! There are so many humans here!</font>

192
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,460

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I know! Would you like some takoyaki?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Takoyaki?! That's my favorite food!</font>

205

209

210
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I've finally gotten to meet one of them!</font>

211
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's so cute~!</font>

212
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've ever met one!</font>

213
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie, was it?</font>

214
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not the first time.</font>

215
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You met old lady Kokoro, didn't you?</font>

216
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark? No, that wasn't scary. Not scary at all.</font>

217
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The scariest thing we've encountered so far was...</font>

218
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, that's right, Sanji! Let's just pretend that never happened!</font>

219
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first mermaid we've ever met!</font>

220
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are so rude!</font>

221
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Old lady Kokoro was a mermaid?</font>

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she could walk, couldn't she?</font>

223
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... You didn't know, huh?</font>

224
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it happened while you were fighting that Lucci fellow after all.</font>

225
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Imagining old lady Kokoro as a mermaid is really gross for some reason.</font>

226
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are too freaking blunt!</font>

227
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez, when it comes to this guy's expectations of mermaids...</font>

228
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she seems like a cute mermaid, doesn't she?</font>

229
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my first encounter with a mermaid too.</font>

230
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me, would you please lend me some money?</font>

231
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would she?!</font>

232
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A skeleton!</font>

233
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?! How are you gonna make it up if you scare her?! Get lost!</font>

234
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can open my head as well. Isn't that funny?</font>

235
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...!</font>

236
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so funny!</font>

237
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She sure got over that quickly.</font>

238
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, can you poop?</font>

239
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you trying to ask, damn you?!</font>

240
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, well, I...</font>

241
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't answer!</font>

242
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">{\an8}She does not poop!</font>

243
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie? Camie? This is just weird...</font>

244
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you missing someone?</font>

245
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's the one left out of this fun group?</font>

246
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer: Me.</font>

247
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. I was wondering about this...</font>

248
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Camie, what's this?
This talking glove-thingy...</font>

249
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, sorry. I completely forgot.
He's my pet, Pappag.</font>

250
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a starfish, and he's my master.</font>

251
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice to meet you!</font>

252
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can starfish talk?</font>

253
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it strange for her pet to be her master?</font>

254
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I was taken in, and with reason.</font>

255
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,280
<font face="FOT-Greco Std B" size="39">Camie always feeds me clams</font>

256
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So she feeds you?</font>

257
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:35,500
<font face="FOT-Greco Std B" size="39">Am I a person? I'm a starfish, yet I'm not a human.</font>

258
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:43,200
<font face="FOT-Greco Std B" size="39">Am I not a person? I'm not a person, but I am a starfish.</font>

259
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,870
<font face="FOT-Greco Std B" size="39">Are you busy? No, it's fine.</font>

260
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,040
<font face="FOT-Greco Std B" size="39">We've got enough hands around here.</font>

261
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay, thank you!</font>

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where you're supposed to laugh!</font>

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, this T-shirt is of the "Criminal" brand, and it's really popular on Fishman Island these days.</font>

264
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?</font>

265
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's pretty cool.</font>

266
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pappug designed it!</font>

267
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to become a designer one day too!</font>

268
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will! You'll definitely make it, Camie!</font>

269
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Sanji!</font>

270
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody listens to me...</font>

271
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, you. How can you talk?</font>

272
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you asked!</font>

273
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when I was a kid, I always thought I was a human.</font>

274
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the time I found out that I was actually a starfish, I was already speaking the human language!</font>

275
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it really work like that?</font>

276
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, the world works in strange and frightening ways. That's just how the world is!</font>

277
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="42">Pappag</font></font>

278
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="27">The starfish</font></font>

279
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,750
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="27">(Criminal brand
designer)</font></font>

280
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I'm Pappag the starfish!</font>

281
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up-and-coming designer.</font>

282
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for saving me!</font>

283
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief! We were having trouble figuring out what to do. I want to ask you something...</font>

284
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami! The takoyaki comes first!</font>

285
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that's right! The takoyaki to show my gratitude!</font>

286
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I've got to meet up with Hacchin somewhere.</font>

287
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin?</font>

288
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, Hacchin? This is Camie!</font>

289
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry I got kinda lost. Where are you right now?</font>

290
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that voice must be Camie, right?</font>

291
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin?</font>

292
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know who you're talking to?
This ain't Hacchin, y'know!</font>

293
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not Hacchin?!</font>

294
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Macro! From the simple-minded Macro Crew! Wait, I shouldn't say that myself...</font>

295
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like trouble.</font>

296
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you have Hacchin's Transponder Snail?</font>

297
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">'Cause we beat up Hachi! Isn't it obvious?!</font>

298
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar! There is no way Hacchin would lose to you guys!</font>

299
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you have a point. Usually, we'd be no match for him,</font>

300
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but this time, we had the Flying Fish Riders on our side!</font>

301
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Flying Fish Riders?!</font>

302
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie, are you still alright? Thank goodness.</font>

303
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin! Did they really beat you?</font>

304
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I let my guard down.</font>

305
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come here! I'll take out these guys and come straight back! It'll be fine!</font>

306
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y'know, Camie, we're just about to sell this guy.</font>

307
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Octopus Fishmen are pretty rare, so he should fetch us quite the price.</font>

308
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feel free to come and save him!</font>

309
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're at the Sabaody Archipelago, in the waters five kilometres east of grove 44.</font>

310
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where the Flying Fish Riders' base is!</font>

311
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Camie, don't come here!</font>

312
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you damn octopus!</font>

313
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya!</font>

314
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin...</font>

315
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what about the takoyaki?</font>

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the time for that!</font>

317
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait... The voice of that Hacchin guy we just heard on the Transponder-Snail. It seemed kinda familiar...</font>

318
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just my imagination, right? There's no way...</font>

319
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, Luffy-chin. Can we do takoyaki later?</font>

320
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got to go save my friend!</font>

321
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

322
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

323
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Camie.</font>

324
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shouldn't be meddling here, but if you want to save your friend, then we'll help you!</font>

325
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's wrong. I mean, they'll help you!</font>

326
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

327
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in exchange, how about you help us get to Fishman Island?</font>

328
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, Nami-chin?</font>

329
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna help me save Hacchin, Luffy-chin?</font>

330
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'm fine with it. But who is this Hacchin anyway?</font>

331
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He runs the Takoyaki store I work at.</font>

332
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our takoyaki is the best in the world!</font>

333
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's important!</font>

334
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men! Even if it costs you your lives, we're gonna save the takoyaki!</font>

335
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

336
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say it's okay. So, do you know where they are?</font>

337
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, let's see...</font>

338
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grove 44 is an island at the very eastern edge of the archipelago.</font>

339
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">5 kilometres west from there. I guess the Flying Fish Riders' base would be about here.</font>

340
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing how we're about here right now...</font>

341
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we head straight for the Sabaody Archipelago from here, we should pass it on the way.</font>

342
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, let's head west!</font>

343
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afterwards we can ask the fish, and figure it out.</font>

344
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right. Let's hurry and go!</font>

345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

346
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! The fish are sticking their heads out!</font>

347
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want you to lead the way!</font>

348
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say they're afraid of the Flying Fish and won't take us all the way, but will show us the direction.</font>

349
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incredible! You can talk to fish?</font>

350
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had no idea mermaids could do that!</font>

351
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie, if you were around, we could eat as much fish as we wanted!</font>

352
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch your mouth. I'll beat you senseless.</font>

353
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But how do we follow the fish in the sea anyway?</font>

354
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, just take a look!</font>

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

356
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can do this? I don't believe it!</font>

357
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fish are drawing an arrow on the sea!</font>

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fantastic! We just have to follow this, right?</font>

359
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're awesome, Camie!</font>

360
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I have a long way to go.</font>

361
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, this is really impressive!</font>

362
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Then, I'll take the helm!</font>

363
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn it around to 4 o'clock.</font>

364
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

365
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

366
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we already setting off? Does it look like we can make it to Fishman Island?</font>

367
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget that, and look here. It's Camie the mermaid! She's real! Awesome, right?</font>

368
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello!</font>

369
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mermaid?</font>

370
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First time I've seen one.</font>

371
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He erased it! He just... erased his memory!</font>

372
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'm worried.</font>

373
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin sounded like he had trouble talking. I'm sure they've done something awful to him.</font>

374
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, he's tough, so it should be alright.</font>

375
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, you guys were pretty quick to offer your help, but are you sure you can handle this?</font>

376
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! We're strong.</font>

377
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should warn you, there's not just one gang of kidnappers around here.</font>

378
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Human trading is big business on Sabaody Archipelago.</font>

379
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Selling human lives? That's horrible!</font>

380
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And seeing how mermaids are particularly valuable,</font>

381
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Macro crew, a gang of three fishmen, have been after Camie for a while now.</font>

382
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi from the Takoyaki shop probably thought we were kidnapped by the Macro Crew</font>

383
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and went after them, since we'd been missing for a while after we were eaten by that monster.</font>

384
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's probably it.</font>

385
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin is a kind, straight-forward person after all.</font>

386
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my fault.</font>

387
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hearing about this octopus named Hachi,
I can't help but think of that stupid fishman.</font>

388
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's really him, then we're not gonna help.</font>

389
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, there's no way...</font>

390
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usually, Hachi could beat those guys easily...</font>

391
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But who'd have thought the Flying Fish Riders would help them?</font>

392
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're they?</font>

393
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another kidnapping gang who started causing a lot of trouble around these parts recently.</font>

394
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say that if they target you, you're doomed.</font>

395
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their boss, Duval, is a guy with an iron mask.</font>

396
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody knows what he really looks like.</font>

397
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like they're looking for someone.</font>

398
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They check every single ship that passes this area.</font>

399
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, anyway, there's no need for you to worry, Camie. We'll definitely save the takoyaki!</font>

400
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the takoyaki seller!</font>

401
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Luffy-chin!</font>

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, Brook! Play a song to get us in the mood!</font>

403
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With pleasure!</font>

404
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Is that...?</font>

405
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! We're in trouble!</font>

406
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Camie?</font>

407
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fish said, "We're sorry, but we can't take you any further."</font>

408
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're here! The Flying Fish Riders!</font>

409
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where? I can't see anything!</font>

410
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wrong! They're not in the sea, but in the air!</font>

411
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fish are flying!</font>

412
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So cool!</font>

413
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this the time to be impressed?!</font>

414
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, they're gonna attack us!</font>

415
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the "Flying Fish" really can fly?!</font>

416
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, did you see that?!</font>

417
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw it! No doubt, that's the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

418
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Contact him right now!</font>

419
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

420
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We only came here to find a single mermaid, but this must be our lucky day!</font>

421
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master Duval is gonna be overjoyed!</font>

422
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come again!</font>

423
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come any closer!</font>

424
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bombs, huh?</font>

425
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn those guys!</font>

426
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

427
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">72 Pound Canon!</font>

428
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

429
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close.</font>

430
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! Once the flying fish jump out of the water, they can stay in the air for five minutes!</font>

431
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,530
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Flying Fish Riders'
Hideout</font>

432
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Macro.</font>

433
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Duval, my lord.</font>

434
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that the mermaid you were luring to the base is on a pirate ship right now.</font>

435
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Camie is on a pirate ship?!</font>

436
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sick of waiting... I really was sick of waiting!</font>

437
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pirate ship is the one I've been waiting for!</font>

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll kill him!</font>

439
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man who screwed up my life!</font>
