96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,830

Straw Hat must have messed with his brain somehow!</font>

118

119
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,260

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure all our brokers get the footage!</font>

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>All of them will probably be dead within five years.</i></font>

134
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  That is him!</font>

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is the one
who caused the kind-hearted children to...</font>

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who caused them to...</font>

137
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know.</font>

138
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've tricked everyone here, huh?</font>

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this island?!</font>

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, of course.</font>

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is like gas or air.</font>

142
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A seemingly non-existent island!</font>

143
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is why it has such close ties to the underworld.</font>

144
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a base of underworld science.</font>

145
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can perform illegal experiments or obtain experimental subjects.  I'm free to do whatever I want!</font>

146
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have powerful backers that completely erase everything that happens from the records!</font>

147
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Officially, nothing never happened!</font>

148
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how much you cry or whine, no help will ever come here!</font>

149
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know nothing about this island, Straw Hat!</font>

150
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you go off half-cocked and interfere here,
you won't live to tell the tale!</font>

151
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The same goes for your alliance with Law.</font>

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's trying to interfere with the SAD production.</font>

153
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the only one who can make it, so he's using you to kidnap me.</font>

154
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:14,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the factory owned by Donquixote Doflamingo,
the most dangerous member of the Seven Warlords,</font>

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it is transformed into a fruit called Smile.</font>

156
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smiles are artificially created Zoan-type Devil Fruits!</font>

157
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a fruit that anyone seeking strength would want to get their hands on!</font>

158
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo is using the Smiles
to make deals with the big shots in the New World.</font>

159
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that one of the Four Emperors is already using them to form an army of hundreds of Devil Fruit users!</font>

160
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sends chills down your spine, doesn't it?</font>

161
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now do you understand what you're meddling with?</font>

162
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you see how many big shots you'd piss off by interfering with Doflamingo's business?!</font>

163
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If those big shots move against you, the world itself will tremble!</font>

164
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Law is trying to make that happen.  The fool!</font>

165
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone at your level
would be completely obliterated.</font>

166
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can try to capture me, but I am protected!</font>

167
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By Doflamingo!  By the Four Emperors!</font>

168
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have the guts to pick a fight with them?!</font>

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been picking those sorts of fights the whole damn way!</font>

170
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Master!</font>

171
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, what the hell do you think you're doing? </font>

172
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!  Didn't you listen to a word I said?</font>

173
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think that you'll get away with this!</font>

174
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have the support... of a notorious lunatic pirate!</font>

175
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Seven Warlords, Donquixote Doflamingo!</font>

176
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He controls the New World's black market.</font>

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons, artillery, drugs!
All dangerous goods have to go through him first!</font>

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, he's the very root of evil...</font>

179
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and connected to every big shot in the underworld.</font>

180
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But, if you apologize now...</font>

181
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be willing to forgive your ignorance.</font>

182
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Think carefully about all the horrifying monsters
you'll anger by harming me!</font>

183
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gastille!</font>

184
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that!</font>

185
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>There it is! </i></font>

186
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His Gas Burner can even melt steel!</font>

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he melt?  Or maybe he was blown away?</font>

188
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-Th-Th-That's right!</font>

189
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a rookie who only just arrived
in The New World, so you might not understand yet...</font>

190
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's a monster in this laboratory right now!</font>

191
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Vergo!
No one can withstand his Color of Arms!</font>

192
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both Smoker and Law are going to die.</font>

193
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your entire crew is going...</font>

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't <i>care!</i></font>

195
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shinokuni, a deadly gas
that petrifies people and leeches their life,</i></font>

196
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>has been leaking into the laboratory.</i></font>

197
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?</font>

198
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We would've caught up to the children already if you just ran in a straight line!</font>

199
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

200
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try and run faster everyone, we have to hurry!</font>

201
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel dizzy, like I just woke up from a dream.</font>

202
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.  It's just an aftereffect from the sedative. </font>

203
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Most of the survivors
are heading for the only exit off the island.</i></font>

204
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Located on the first floor of Building R,
where Luffy and Caesar are currently fighting.</i></font>

205
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But Kin'emon continues to search for his son,
Momonosuke.</i></font>

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a terrible mistake I have made, Momonosuke! </font>

207
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?
Momonosuke transformed into a small dragon?</i></font>

208
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!  I might have cut down my own son!</font>

209
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Momonosuke!</font>

210
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have done something unforgivable! </font>

211
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kin'emon-san, you mustn't run in that direction!</font>

212
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That area is filling with poisonous gas!</font>

213
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a sneak attack!</font>

214
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does this always happen to me?</font>

215
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you trying to do?</font>

216
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Against a superior Haki user, turning into smoke just increases the size of your body.</font>

217
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes you an easier target!</font>

218
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you insist on using your ability?</font>

219
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you lost your head?</font>

220
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This fighting style isn't like you at all, Smoker-kun.</font>

221
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Demon Staff!</font>

222
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may want to punish me for dishonoring the Navy...</font>

223
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you lack the skill, Smoker.</font>

224
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bravery alone will not protect your subordinates.</font>

225
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker, thanks for returning my heart.</font>

226
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what you were up to.</font>

227
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My debt to you has been repaid.</font>

228
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and defeat him.</font>

229
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really hated
that you were indebted to a pirate, huh?</font>

230
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an embarrassment as a Marine.</font>

231
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd never be able to face my subordinates.</font>

232
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I suppose it's true that you helped me.</font>

233
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the end for you...</font>

234
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo<i>-san.</i></font>

235
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You brat,</font>

236
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you finally remember how to speak to your superiors.</font>

237
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's what you want to believe.</font>

238
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think that you can stay on your high horses forever, you two!</font>

239
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know you can hear me, Joker!</font>

240
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo is done for.</font>

241
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've lost your most important subordinate,</font>

242
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and Caesar will be taken down by Straw Hat.</font>

243
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means, you will lose all your SAD.</font>

244
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was your own overconfidence
that blinded you to this possibility.</font>

245
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead and look down on us and laugh as usual
while you think of your next move.</font>

246
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you won't be laughing for very long...</font>

247
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">because we're going to keep on surprising you.</font>

248
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're acting really tough for a little shrimp.</font>

249
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But are you sure you can back it up?</font>

250
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would suspect...</font>

251
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that you've upset Vergo.</font>

252
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you remember what happened last time?</font>

253
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Remember?  Remember what happens when you push Vergo too far?</font>

254
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must have traumatized you.
There's no way you could ever forget...</font>

255
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the terror that Vergo put into you.</font>

256
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your cutting ability may be powerful but...</font>

257
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">his Haki will easily block it.</font>

258
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are no match for him,
in neither strength nor position!</font>

259
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been two years since the Great War.</font>

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who set what in motion back then?</font>

261
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All you did is protect the position you've grown comfortable in.</font>

262
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All Whitebeard did was end an era.</font>

263
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,050

264
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,740

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You always said that an unstoppable wave is coming.
One that brings a new age for the strong.</font>

268
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've destroyed the gears.</font>

269
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now, there's no turning back!</font>
