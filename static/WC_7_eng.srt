129
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't do that.</font>

130
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah! Nami!</font>

131
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

132
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama already knows that you guys are here!</font>

134
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

135
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you think no one knew?! How idiotic!</font>

136
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all coming after you now.
Mama ordered us to!</font>

137
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one...</font>

138
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And them...</font>

139
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those fools...</font>

140
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And him!</font>

141
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've <i>all</i> been told by Mama that we need to...</font>

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"let the Straw Hats keep going for now. Just don't let them find Sanji.</font>

143
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make them regret trying to mess with me!"</font>

144
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama knows everything!</font>

145
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, homies! Don't let them escape!</font>

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't get away!</font>

147
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

148
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

149
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, run!</font>

150
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are too many of them!
If all three of us get caught, we're done for!</font>

151
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're members of an emperor's crew!
We underestimated them!</font>

152
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go look for Luffy!
I'll do the best I can here!</font>

153
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! I'll be back!</font>

154
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rumble!</font>

155
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monster Point!</font>

156
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that! You were already interesting,
but you're able to do this too?!</font>

157
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama will be happy!</font>

158
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She doesn't just seek every race; 
she also collects all kinds of strange creatures.</font>

159
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, catch them!</font>

160
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop, you brat!</font>

161
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go away!</font>

162
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy! Where are you?!</font>

163
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I kept running around,</font>

164
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">looking for you until it got dark.</font>

165
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see! I'm glad that you found me!</font>

166
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

167
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go save Chopper and Carrot right now!
Where are they?!</font>

168
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right here.</font>

169
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?</font>

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of that happened right here.</font>

171
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now, they're all gone.
That's why I'm asking this guy!</font>

172
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were watching the whole time!
Where's Chopper? And what about Carrot?!</font>

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Brûlée lady and the forest monsters
didn't mess with you at all!</font>

174
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means you're one of them!</font>

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... One of them?
Well, we're not enemies...</font>

176
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! If you want to know,
bring me some apple juice from over on my left–</font>

177
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time for that!</font>

178
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you tell us something useful,
then sure, we'll bring it to you!</font>

179
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

180
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, since you've been mentioning it so much, I wanna try it too.</font>

181
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way,</font>

182
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?</font>

183
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you look pretty strong, but...</font>

184
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are <i>you<font size="14"> </font></i></font>?

185
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes, I am strong! Why does that matter?</font>

186
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. Appearances aren't everything, I guess.</font>

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That reindeer guy was surprisingly strong,</font>

188
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the trees of the forest 
attacked him without hesitation.</font>

189
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once they get an order, they don't stop</font>

190
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">until they complete it!</font>

191
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? Then, why did they stop attacking me?</font>

192
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I beat a bunch of them,
they left me alone, too!</font>

193
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, how are they alive, anyways?</font>

194
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every six months,
each resident of Totto Land</font>

195
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">must pay a month's worth 
of their soul to the kingdom,</font>

196
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in exchange for their safety.</font>

197
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soul?</font>

198
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, their lifespan, basically.</font>

199
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?!</font>

200
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the people lose two months
of their lifespan in a year...</font>

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and one year of their lifespan for every six.</font>

202
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that possible?</font>

203
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Linlin, I mean, Big Mom
ate the Soul-Soul Fruit.</font>

204
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She can manipulate people's souls.</font>

205
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With that power,
she takes the life span of her citizens.</font>

206
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At that moment, the citizens have to choose 
to stay in Totto Land or leave.</font>

207
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And by spreading the collected souls
all over the country,</font>

208
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">all kinds of things take on a life of their own.</font>

209
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We call those who came to life "the homies."</font>

210
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The collection and distribution of souls</font>

211
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is handled by Linlin's... um, 
Big Mom's incarnations made of her own soul.</font>

212
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what happens in Totto Land.</font>

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we first arrived, there were 
lots of odd things alive in the town of chocolate.</font>

214
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that why the crocodile was able to talk?! 
And the human-like rabbit?!</font>

215
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right.
Animals can be personified too.</font>

216
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an incredible ability!</font>

217
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">So, what about these guys?</font>

218
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're something else.</font>

219
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brûlée used her ability to turn normal animals into people.</font>

220
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, by the way, souls can't be 
put into other people or corpses.</font>

221
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you tell me that before?!
You've been watching me the whole time!</font>

222
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I didn't want to get involved!</font>

223
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you didn't want to get involved, then why are you buried here?!</font>

224
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?! Who are you?!</font>

225
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me! I'll get you the juice!</font>

226
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Okay! I'll tell you! 
Just get off of me! Stop!</font>

227
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long ago... <i>very</i> long ago, I was Big Mom's...
I mean, the pirate Charlotte Linlin's...</font>

228
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Linlin's...</font>

229
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Linlin's husband!</font>

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh... What?!</font>

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Why is one of the
Three Sweet Commanders here?!</font>

235
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to...</font>

236
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">put an end...</font>

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,090

240
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh.</font>

241
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:12,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She and I had two daughters, and then she threw me out.</font>

242
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not that anyone's after me...</font>

243
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They just don't pay attention to me!</font>

244
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

245
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that?</font>

246
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sir, what brings you here?</font>

247
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I not allowed to be here?</font>

248
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Of course you are.</font>

249
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

250
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</font>

251
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

252
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</font>

253
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– His body's coming out!
– Get back, Nami!</font>

254
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

255
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought he was a giant!</font>

256
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you? What kind of a fool just gives the enemy information like that?!</font>

361
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this sympathy?</font>

362
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After seeing someone dozens of times, 
they tend to grow on you!</font>

365
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't good!</font>

366
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Minister Cracker is gonna start a fight here!</font>

367
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Homies!
Catch those two so we can finish this!</font>

368
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not safe here! Let's run!</font>

369
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

370
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll take care of them!</font>

371
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them get away!</font>

372
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's your name?!</font>

373
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Pound.</font>

374
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you mention Lola before?</font>

375
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Yeah.</font>

376
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,940

377
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um...</font>

378
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found it!</font>

379
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

380
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the vivre card of my friend Lola's mom.</font>

381
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't know if it's Big Mom's or not...</font>

382
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!
What's wrong, guys?!</font>

383
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Kingbaum?!
Even you're stopping?!</font>

384
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't do it, Brûlée!</font>

385
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">What?</font>

386
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We homies cannot fight against her!</font>

387
