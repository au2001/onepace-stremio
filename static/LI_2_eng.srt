we can even cut through mountains.</font>

105
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dorry! I got us some booze,
courtesy of our guests.</font>

106
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Great! It's been a while

114
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">is it true the log takes
an entire year to register?</font>

115
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why, didn't you notice 
the human skulls lying around?</font>

116

die before their log is ready.</font>

117

118
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Others starve or 
succumb to the heat.</font>

119
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Still, others attack us, 
and we in turn kill them. They all die.</font>

120
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It seems that one year on this island 
is too long for humans.</font>

121
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then what can we do? 
Even if we could survive for a year,</font>

122
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">if that much time passes, who knows what will become of my country?</font>

123
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,920

if we stayed an entire year.</font>

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hmm.</font>

126
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We do have an eternal pose, 
but it's to our hometown, Elbaf.</font>

127
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You could even say we're
fighting for this eternal pose.</font>

128
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Do you want to try 
taking it by force?</font>

129
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's no good.
That's not where we wanna go.</font>

130
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We just wanna go to the island 
after this one. Right?</font>

131
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes.</font>

132
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If we lose the route to Arabasta, 
there's no point in moving forward.</font>

133
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">See?</font>

134
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then why don't you take a chance 
and sail ahead anyway?</font>

135
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If luck is on your side,
you'll reach your destination.</font>

136
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Maybe we'll do that!</font>

137
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Who knows? We might just make it.</font>

138
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You know, long ago,</font>

139
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">there was someone who left before the log was ready.</font>

140
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What happened to him?</font>

141
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How should I know?</font>

142
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He must've gotten to the next island.</font>

143
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That must be it!</font>

144
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's so funny?</font>

145
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I can't understand
what they're thinking!</font>

146
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A brave warrior of the sea? 
What's that?</font>

147
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm talking about <i>you<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! I wanna
be just like you two someday.

148
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hm? You mean a giant?</font>

149
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">See?</font>

150
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's not it!</font>

151
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I hope to live proudly 
just like the warriors of Elbaf!</font>

152
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, that's it!</font>

153
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We live so much longer
than you humans,</font>

154
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">so we often think upon
how we will die.</font>

155
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Your assets, your life...
All will eventually cease to exist.</font>

156
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But if we die as warriors of Elbaf 
with our pride intact,</font>

157
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>that</i> would be an honorable death.</font>

158
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That pride is an everlasting treasure 
that is passed on in the land of Elbaf.</font>

159
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, pride is your treasure? 
That's so cool!</font>

160
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I've decided! From now on,
I will call you master!</font>

161
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

162
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Giant old guy!</font>

163
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's going on?!</font>

164
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why did his drink explode?</font>

165
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That alcohol came 
from our ship, didn't it?!</font>

166
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It exploded in his stomach!</font>

167
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That other giant must have 
laced it with an explosive.</font>

168
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Were we even watching
the same thing?!</font>

169
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After 100 years of fighting, 
they'd never do something like this!</font>

170
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then who in the world…?</font>

171
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You bastards did.</font>

172
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It wasn't Brogy.</font>

173
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We are proud warriors 
that hail from Elbaf.</font>

174
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Other than you,
who else is there to suspect?</font>

175
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We need to run!</font>

176
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Talking to him won't be of any use!</font>

177
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Probably just as useless to run.</font>

178
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hold this and stay back.</font>

179
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can't mean… 
You plan on fighting him?</font>

180
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Sorry ‘bout this, old guy,
but I need to shut you up.</font>

181
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Both of you, stop! Please!</font>

182
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dorry-<i>san</i>, please listen!</font>

183
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We're in the dark about this too!</font>

184
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We're clueless about the explosion!
Please don't fight!</font>

185
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You need to stay put! Your insides 
are in bad shape right now!</font>

186
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How dare you... 
do something so detestable!</font>

187
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

188
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

189
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm sorry.</font>

190
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Rocket!!</font>

191
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

192
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So he has... 
the powers of a devil fruit.</font>

193
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I underestimated... him.</font>

194
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Are you all right?

195
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How's the old guy?</font>

196
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I think he's okay.</font>

197
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You made the right call.</font>

198
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He might not have calmed down.</font>

199
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm really ticked off!</font>

200
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

201
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Like the old guy said,</font>

202
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">that explosion isn't what the 
other giant would do,</font>

203
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and <i>my</i> friends would never do 
a stupid thing like that!</font>

204
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then who could have...?</font>

205
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's someone else 
on this island.</font>

206
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">In essence, mental anguish 
sways the outcomes of conflicts.</font>

207
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Confusion has set in,</font>

208
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">all thanks to a mysterious bomb
served by an invisible foe.</font>

209
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now, regarding our first target,
Dorry the Blue Ogre,</font>

210
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">finishing him off was unlikely,</font>

211
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but the damage his stomach received must have been considerable.</font>

212
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So, let us enjoy our tea 
and await the start of the next duel.</font>

213
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And, what, we let the other giant
finish off the injured one?</font>

214
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's right.</font>

215
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A very roundabout 
way of doing things.</font>

216
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's because these warrior types
act exactly like wild boars.</font>

217
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If we avoid a direct confrontation,
we can fight with minimal risk.</font>

218
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After all, we are no match
for their raw strength,</font>

219
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but our brain power 
more than compensates for it.</font>

220
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Seriously! Can't you get it 
on your own, Miss Golden Week?</font>

221
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Out of curiosity, what's the plan
with the Straw Hat gang?</font>

222
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Straw Hat...? Oh, the small-timers
who discovered the boss's secret.</font>

223
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We will lure them out one by one,
starting with the easiest among them,</font>

224
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">right to my service set.</font>

225
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My motto: Wicked deeds are best served with a dash of foul play.</font>

226
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There are countless ways to defeat
your enemies without lifting a finger.</font>

227
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 3, refill please.</font>

228
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey. Me too.</font>

229
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You guys! 
Take time to savor it!</font>

230
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ah!</font>

231
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That mountain... Isn't it...?</font>

232
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's the signal.</font>

233
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's quite active today.</font>

234
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're going?! Your wounds 
from that last battle still haven't–</font>

235
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's nothing! We're both 
in the same condition!</font>

236
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Making excuses during a fight to
the death would disgrace my name!</font>

237
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! Wait, old guy!</font>

238
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't go!</font>

239
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You can't go, Dorry-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!
You need to keep still!

240
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You'll die if you 
push yourself too hard!</font>

241
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I, warrior Dorry, am here.</font>

242
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">At the very least,</font>

243
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I will fight to uphold 
the name of Elbaf!</font>
