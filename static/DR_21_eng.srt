00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,070

245
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The toys who are forced to work everyday down here.</font>

246
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he talking about us?</font>

247
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our comrades who are slaving away in the factory.</font>

248
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The toys who look cheerful walking through town as they cry inside.</font>

249
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poor big folk who don't realize they've lost someone dear to them.</font>

250
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland's gonna save us all.</font>

251
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a legendary hero!</font>

252
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like hell I'm gonna pretend to be a hero!</font>

253
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poor you.</font>

254
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was lying all along.</font>

255
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,490

257
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all about to die, and he still hasn't shown up. That's all the proof you need.</font>

258
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the hero?</font>

259
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well? Where?</font>

260
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he said he'd save us.</font>

261
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably somewhere laughing at how stupid you all are.</font>

262
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are way too trusting.</font>

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if this isn't some dream you made up,</font>

264
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="42">and he really did say he'd save everyone, then he's the kind of guy who
 runs away in the face of danger.</font></font>

265
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just throw away all hope!</font>

266
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hate to say it, but he's mostly right.</font>

267
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys run away too. Good luck.</font>

268
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-That can't be...</font>

269
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,240

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland would never tell a lie!</font>

271
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland is...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Amazing!</i></font>

274
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what, Usoland will definitely save us.</font>

275
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what he told us!</font>

276
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

277
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

278
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

279
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

280
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

281
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's right! That's right! That's right!</i></font>

282
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He promised us.</font>

283
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A hero would never deceive us!</font>

284
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you keep besmirching Usoland's name,
you'll regret it.</font>

285
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should prepare yourselves.</font>

286
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Usoland comes, you won't-</font><font size="13"></font>

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a funny scream.</font>

288
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Tontattans have such a funny death cry.</font>

289
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo!</font>

290
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. It's as Leo says.</font>

291
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland will complete Operation SOP!</font>

292
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

293
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should feel sorry for yourselves, not us!</font>

294
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then hurry up and call him, your <i>hero</i>.</font>

295
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How cruel is he?!</font>

296
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, just stop!</font>

297
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give it a rest already!</font>

298
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland!</font>

301
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad.</font>

302
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just how long are you gonna believe in me, you idiotic dwarves?!</font>

303
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just as he said, it was all a lie.</font>

304
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a legendary hero, and Usoland isn't my name.</font>

305
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the sniper from the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

306
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Usopp!</font>

307
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a pirate!</font>

308
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-The Straw Hat Pirates?</font>

309
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are they down here?</font>

310
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why...</font>

311
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you say that?</font>

312
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may be a pirate, but you're still a hero, right?</font>

313
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you, no!</font>

314
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pirate is a pirate!</font>

315
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make me keep repeating myself!</font>

316
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was lying to you all!</font>

317
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you just kept believing me!</font>

318
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you came all the way here just to say it was a lie?</font>

319
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I didn't, these guys would keep waiting until they died.</font>

320
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happened, I could never live with myself.</font>

321
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since they insist on believing in me so much,</font>

322
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to do the cool thing and risk my life to save them!</font>

325
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I die, then build me a statue beside Noland's!</font>

326
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm about to become your legendary hero!</font>

329
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he gonna be the one to save us?</font>

330
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How desperate.</font>

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku...</font>

345
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a fine sword.</font>

349
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When he learned that the news of 
Doflamingo's abdication was incorrect,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What talent! If that blade had been sharp, his opponent would've died instantly!</font>

378
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outside they call it "brutality", but in here it's "talent", huh?</font>

379
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He effortlessly beat his cell mates half to death.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want with me, King Riku?!</font>

382
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku is saying that if you can win a hundred battles,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go back out, murderer!</font>

388
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't leave?</font>

389
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't go where I'm not wanted.</font>

390
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did you start caring about being wanted?</font>

391
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut it!</font>
