00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's covered in an enormous bubble!  And there are clouds on the inside?</font>

133
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe there's air in there!</font>

134
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We did it!  We're here!</i></font>

135
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the most famous spots on the Grand Line!</font>

136
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so we're here?</font>

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The island where the mermaids dance...</font>

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The beautiful mermaid princess...</font>

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally, I'm here!  In the paradise I've dreamed of since I was a kid!</font>

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mermaids!  Mermai-</i></font>

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i>  It's hopeless!
Just imagining it caused him to become like this?!</font>

142
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry, Sanji!
I couldn't rehabilitate you in time!</font>

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be better if you didn't meet the real mermaids.</font>

144
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor!  Meeting the mermaids of Fishman Island is his dream!</font>

145
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if he meets them, he'll die!</font>

146
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!</font>

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't mind.</font>

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

149
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to live the rest of my life
without fulfilling this dream.</font>

150
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather see the mermaids and die from over-excitement!</font>

151
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the worst!</font>

152
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I <i>will</i> meet the mermaids!</font>

153
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so excited!  I wonder what sort of meat
they eat on Fishman Island?</font>

154
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, could you wipe that drool off your face
and ask Surume a favor?</font>

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's search for the entrance to Fishman Island.</font>

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's with those guys?!</font>

157
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are they?!</font>

158
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a herd of sea monsters!</font>

159
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're done for!  And we made it so far!</i></font>

160
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These sea monsters are so...</font>

161
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">cool!</font>

162
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone's riding them!</font>

163
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you letting those humans boss you around...</font>

164
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kraken?</font>

165
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, Surume?!  Carry us for the last stretch too!</font>

166
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the Straw Hat Crew, aren't you?</font>

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know the name well...</font>

168
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the pirates who took out Arlong's crew.</font>

169
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's all you'd done,
our reaction would be obvious.</font>

170
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But of all things, two years ago you defended Hachi-san, a former member of Arlong's crew...</font>

171
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and from what I hear, you even beat up
one of those despicable Celestial Dragons!</font>

172
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Acts worthy of Fisher Tiger,

180
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or will you refuse us?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you say no, we'll sink you right here and now.</font>

182
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

183
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky, refill the fuel.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What are you planning?</font>

185
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way Luffy and the others will do what those guys say.</font>

186
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even so, we're 10 kilometers underwater.</font>

189
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll use up all the air left on the ship in one last Coup de Burst to charge straight toward the island!</font>

190
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?!</font>

191
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's either that, or we came all this way just to die.</font>

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True.  I can't see any other way to survive this.</font>

193
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!  I'll go fill up the fuel tanks!</font>

194
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,780

196
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, will you become our underling, Straw Hat Luffy?</font>

197
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

198
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moron!</font>

199
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You refuse... You reject my invitation to join the New Fishman Pirates?!</font>

200
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, you are enemies of the fishmen!  Just a group of sinful humans!</font>

201
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why should I have to be your underling?!</font>

202
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  You really shouldn't taunt them!</font>

203
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a shame.
There's no way I can let you pass now. {Gil: Changed "In that case" because he only said this a few lines ago.}</font>

207
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna fight?!</font>

208
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it, Franky!</font>

209
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny is a lion too!</font>

210
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's settle the score some other day, sea lion!</font>

211
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes...</font>

212
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Burst!</font>

213

214
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship...</font>

215
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The air... is disappearing!</font>

216
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna be flattened...</font>

217
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Endure it!  Until we break through to Fishman Island!</font>

218
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is with that ship?!</font>

219
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're breaking through!</font>

220
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for me, my dear mermaids!</font>

221
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The coating came off!
It was absorbed by the giant bubble!</font>

222
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This bubble has two layers!</font>

223
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A normal ship would plummet to the bottom in this air-filled layer!</font>

224
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna use another Burst to get across!</font>

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on tight!</font>

226
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Water...!</font>

227
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a strong current!</font>

228
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me...</font>

229
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't breathe.</font>

230
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got four Devil Fruit users here!</font>

231
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stretch out... your hands!</font>

232
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!  Robin-chan!</font>

233
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  I can't fight the current!</font>

234
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a reckless way to enter the country... They might have killed themselves.</font>

235
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanna follow them, Hammond?</font>

236
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't be sure if they're dead or alive.</font>

237
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should go, just in case.</font>

238
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want the Neptune Army to find them before we do.</font>

239
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But first, let's return to the Noah, and inform the boss about this.</font>

240
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should let him know that Straw Hat,
the one who shattered Arlong-san's ambitions, is here!</font>

241
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,550
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Depths of Fishman Island</font>

242
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?</font>

243
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

244
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw it!</font>

245
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't see it!</font>

246
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you see it?</font>

247
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if I saw it?</font>

248
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See, he moved!</font>

249
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He moved!</font>

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't move!</font>

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't he move?</font>

252
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if he moved?</font>

253
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  He's awake!</font>

254
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

255
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

256
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad you're alright!</font>

257
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you feel?</font>

258
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it isn't Caimie!  It's been so long!</font>

259
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're even cuter than you were
the last time I saw you, Caimie-chwan!</font>

260
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have we arrived at Fishman Island?</font>

261
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  Apparently the mermaids saved us
when we were about to drown!</font>

262
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!  There's no point in hiding it.  We were all unconscious until now.</font>

263
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Caimie-chan's house.</font>

264
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, your hat.</font>

265
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie's house, huh?</font>

266
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.  I was planning to meet up with you,</font>

267
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I didn't think you were coming until next month.</font>

268
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't sweat it!  Where are the others?</font>

269
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... It appears we were separated.</font>

270
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if they're all okay?</font>

271
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

272
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'm sure they'll manage somehow.</font>

273
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bones won't be much good in the water,</font>

274
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they've got Robo and Green with them.</font>

275
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure they're fine.</font>

276
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I tried to reach them for as long as I could, but we were the only ones dragged to the bottom.</font>

277
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really want to see the others soon.</font>

278
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, here.  You must be cold, right?</font>

279
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I made some soup, so drink up and get warm.</font>

280
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ta-daah!  Cold seaweed soup!</font>

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's delicious.</font>

282
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cold... soup?  {Yes COLD soup is able to keep you warm, silly Usopp. -FAb}</font>

283
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cold soup won't warm you up at all!</i></font>

284
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What am I going to do?!</i></font>

285
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I got it wrong!</i></font>

286
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine, Caimie-chan.</font>

287
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the contrary, it <i>does</i> warm me up!</font>

288
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean "On the contrary"?</font>

289
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey!  Sanji, I want some too!</font>

290
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your clothes are dry!</font>

291
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're dry!</font>

292
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're not dry yet!</font>

293
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't they dry?</font>

294
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if they're dry?</font>

295
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You dried our clothes?</font>

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

297
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, who are you guys?</font>

299

335

336
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are the underwater Coral Apartments.</font>

337
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My room is on the lowest floor, since it's the cheapest.</font>

338
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The highest levels, where the sun shines,
are the most expensive.</font>

339
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you poor?</font>

340
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, what about Hachi and Pappagg?</font>

341
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin got badly injured about a year ago.</font>

342
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  He was protecting the Sunny
on the Sabaody Archipelago, wasn't he?</font>

343
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that his injuries have more or less healed,</font>

344
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but Hacchin was originally a resident of
the Fishman District, so he's recovering there.</font>

345
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman District?</font>

346
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's kind of a scary place, but if you guys
are with me, I don't mind giving you a tour.</font>

347
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go there after!
I have to meet Hachi and thank him, after all.</font>

348
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, I got it.</font>

349
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... And as for Pappagg...</font>

350
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a super-famous designer,</font>

351
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so he's got a huge mansion in Fishverly Hills, the most luxurious part of Fishman Island!</font>

352
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going there to deliver clams for him today.
Why don't you come along?</font>

353
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you his owner?</font>

354
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you live together?</font>

355
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really fit in there.</font>

356
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the clams in these parts taste better anyway.</font>

357
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's that straw-like thing?</font>

358
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's...</font>

359
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Water Road, created by
the bubble craftsmen of the island.</font>

360
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fishes and merfolk like me ride it.</font>

361
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just watch!</font>

362
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've reached the surface!</font>

363
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  I can even swim through the sky!</font>

364
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That looks fun!</font>

365
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

366
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait!  More importantly,
there are clouds and a sky here in the deep sea!</font>

367
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Caimie!</font>

368
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a woman's voice!</font>

369
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,490

370
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are your friends alright now?
The pirates who drowned, I mean.</font>

371
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the ones who
didn't come through the entrance, right?</font>

372
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello.  You don't look too scary.</font>

373
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Illegal immigrants?  How wild!  I really like pirates.</font>

374
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost like a fairy tale world!</font>

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's crying harder than he did when he left the Baratie.</font>

378
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've finally found it!</i></font>

379
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is my All Blue!</i></font>

380
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really sure about that, Sanji?</font>

381
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll introduce them to you.</font>

382
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Luffy-chin, the captain!</font>

383
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crying one is Sanji-chin!</font>

384
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And this is Usopp-chin with the nose!</font>

385
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper-chin the raccoon dog!</font>

386
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a reindeer!</font>

387
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?  Why are you crying?</font>

388
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome!  Let's dance together in the ocean!</font>

389
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh... I understand now.</font>

390
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way such joy could exist.</font>

391

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Negative!</i></font>

393
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, what happened to you during the past two years?!</font>

394
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island is the paradise
you've always dreamed of, right?!</font>

395
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, you're so funny!</font>

396
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This barrel washed ashore with Caimie's friends.
I wonder what's inside it?</font>

397
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alcohol?  Treasure?</font>

398
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who knows... It's sealed pretty tight, though.</font>

399
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think?  Should we secretly open it?</font>

400
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

401

403
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

404
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What should we do, boss?</font>

405
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,920
