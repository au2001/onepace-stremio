43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it floated towards that island.</font>

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It probably lives there.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think we were "eaten" by that mouth.</font>

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means that we have been trapped inside that fence.</font>

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would mean that somebody made this into a wandering island!</font>

58
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,150

59

66
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,680

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,810

130
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Combined with One and Three, which you saw earlier, this is all of 'em!</font>

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really like the way you think, Franky!</font>

138
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! You! You!</font>

139
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I am just really great this week too...</font>

140
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super!</font>

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

142
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

143
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

144
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did something happen?</font>

145
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're they up to?</font>

146
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see anything with this fog.</font>

147
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It came from the direction of the island.</font>

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and let me ride on Mini Merry too!</font>

150
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, you need to worry about Nami-san's safety!</font>

151
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you need to worry about the other two's safety too.</font>

152
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps she screamed as she was cursed by a ghost?</font>

153
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that, it's not funny.</font>

154
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

155
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody was touching the anchor...</font>

156
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still brand new, so the gears shouldn't be that worn out yet...</font>

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and bring it up, the ship's gonna overbalance!</font>

158
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

159
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did someone do that?</font>

160
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

161
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody's close enough.</font>

162
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

163
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?</font>

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop screwing around at a time like this!</font>

165
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyo, yats not ish!</font>

166
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>No, that's not it!</i></font>

167
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yaim noi joing anyjing!</font>

168
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>I'm not doing anything!</i></font>

169
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out, Straw Hat!</font>

170
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, bastard!</font>

171
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell was that for?!</font>

172
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, my sword just did that...</font>

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is weird...</font>

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With the exception of us... on this deck...</font>

175
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something else.</font>

176
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe a ghost did it?</font>

177
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or a devil fruit user, or somethin' like that?</font>

178
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it felt like someone was grabbing me.</font>

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard the growl of a wild beast.</font>

180
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A beast?</font>

181
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I'm worried about Nami-san!</font>

182
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys take care of the ship!</font>

183
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna go save those guys!</font>

184
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So uncool!</font>

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woah, Sanji's floating!</font>

186
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is that possible?!</font>

187
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You made a "hogeh"-noise.</font>

188
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you!</font>

189
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You would've done the same!</font>

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't even leave the ship?</font>

191
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they trying to do?</font>

192
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they wanted us dead, they could've done that by now...</font>

193
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Robin-chan?</font>

194
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's... grabbing me...</font>

195
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you do something like that!</font>

196
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan!</font>

197
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There really is an animal!</font>

198
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What now?</font>

199
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

200
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wave!</font>

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has gotta be some sort of artificial one to be inside this fence!</font>

202
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ship's gonna capsize!</font>

203
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan, is it gone?</font>

204
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fine, I think it left.</font>

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Hogeh, raise the anchor, or we're gonna sink!</font>

206
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who the hell is "Hogeh"?!</font>

207
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp! Chopper!</font>

208
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you hear us?</font>

209
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, we're gonna be seperated from Nami-san.</font>

210
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Franky!</font>

211
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do something with the secret weapon!</font>

212
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I've got the "Flying Surprise Pool" we can use!</font>

213
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sounds fun!</font>

214
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot!</font>

215
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Ouch!</font>

216
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course you're hurt.</font>

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must've fallen down here.</font>

218
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?</font>

219
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're on the ghost island.</font>

220
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghost!</font>

221
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, stop that!</font>

222
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't need to be scared!</font>

223
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But just what happened to us?</font>

224
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were having so much fun on Mini Merry that we accidentally hit the bank.</font>

225
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were distracted and couldn't see in the fog...</font>

226
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All three of us were sent flying...</font>

227
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in the blink of an eye, we were here.</font>

228
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's 100% my fault, but...</font>

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll forgive me since I'm cute, right?</font>

230
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get you for this!</font>

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:42,800
<font face="impress bt" size="45">I'm very sorry.</font>

232
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But anyway, it's weird that just after getting to this island there's a huge ditch!</font>

233
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's probably to catch their enemies.</font>

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just lucky it wasn't filled with spikes.</font>

235
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah,</font>

236
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're safe 'cuz we landed on these skeletons.</font>

237
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to stop!</font>

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this must be the entrance.</font>

239
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we just wait here, Luffy will find us.</font>

240
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we're lower than sea level, that's kinda scary.</font>

241
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it's dangerous, and they might not be able to see us here.</font>

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So should we wait on the bank above?</font>

243
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bank?</font>

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't know which way...</font>

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

246
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dog?</font>

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not a dog...</font>

248
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then... then what is it?</font>

249
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That... it can't be...</font>

250
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ce... Ce...</font>

251
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cerberus!</font>

252
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Cerberus!</font>

253
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is Cerberus?</font>

254
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the guard dog of hell!</font>

255
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really exists?!</font>

256
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must, it's right behind us!</font>

257
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is hell?!</font>

258
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in hell!</font>

259
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just keep running!</font>

260
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it catches us, it'll eat us!</font>

261
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what is it, Chopper?</font>

262
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, what do you see?</font>

263
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Kon"...?</font>

264
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look at it carefully!</font>

265
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't one of them a fox?!</font>

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now it's saying "gon"!</font>

267
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really didn't like it!</font>

268
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</font>

269
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, stairs!</font>

270
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can leave that way!</font>

271
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank god!</font>

272
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it have a bad sense of smell, even though it's a dog?</font>

273
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It left...</font>

274
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What now?</font>

275
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We ended up in a forest...</font>

276
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that thing's walking around, then if we're anywhere not hidden we're in danger...</font>

277
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are correct, sir.</font>

278
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!</font>

279
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am known as Hildon.</font>

280
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw that you all were being chased by the guard dog,</font>

281
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I followed you in secret, in case you had trouble.</font>

282
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be night soon, after all.</font>

283
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forest will become incredibly dangerous to those like yourselves who are unfamiliar with it.</font>

284
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if you wish, I can take you to our mansion.</font>

285
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mansion?</font>

286
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

287
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor Hogback-sama's mansion.</font>

288
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

289
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Chopper?</font>

290
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hogback?</font>

291
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

292
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't see the horses very well through the fog, but...</font>

293
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there something wrong with them?</font>

294
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's only your imagination.</font>

295
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That... that's alright then...</font>

296
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, you saved us.</font>

297
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, we were in trouble.</font>

298
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, it's my pleasure.</font>

299
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you like a drink?</font>

300
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forest is full of odd animals, so walking through it is dangerous.</font>

301
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I was pretty surprised.</font>

302
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought Cerberus was just a made-up creature.</font>

303
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looked like a mutant or something.</font>

304
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was wondering if we'd ever be able to get down from that tree.</font>

305
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're waiting for others, the mansion is ideal.</font>

306
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's very visible, and very safe.</font>

307
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we'll also be able to meet Doctor Hogback.</font>

308
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he really that famous?</font>

309
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every doctor's heard of him.</font>

310
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a surgical genius!</font>

311
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With his miraculous operations, he's saved countless numbers of people!</font>

312
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has all the status and honor a doctor can get,</font>

313
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's respected by doctors everywhere!</font>

314
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But one day,</font>

315
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he suddenly disappeared.</font>

316
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There were rumors that he had been abducted,</font>

317
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the doctors of the world were all in an uproar.</font>

318
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But after years went by without a trace,
Hogback's name is now simply a legend...</font>

319
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Doctor Hogback?!</font>

320
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, even now the Doctor is researching new things.</font>

321
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope I can get an autograph!</font>

322
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure we can arrange it.</font>

323
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

324
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are even lions in this forest?</font>

325
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that for?!</font>

326
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't scare me like that!</font>

327
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

328
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Well, just now, there was a l-lion...</font>

329
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like this.</font>

330
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, right!</font>

331
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, take a look for yourself!</font>

332
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?</font>

333
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Food, food, food!</i></font>

334
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's there!</font>

335
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's definitely there!</font>

336
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait up a sec!</font>

337
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop the cart, Hildon-san!</font>

338
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you so upset?</font>

339
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps you were just seeing things?</font>

340
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, she wasn't!</font>

341
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something out there!</font>

342
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forest is too weird!</font>

343
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it is a strange forest.</font>

344
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And, due to the thick fog and people's paranoia, </font>

345
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">many people believe they see things out here.</font>

346
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, it wasn't real? </font>

347
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's good...</font>

348
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, wait...</font>

349
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An illusion?</font>

350
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it was way too clear!</font>

351
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hildon-san,</font>

352
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, but could you just bring us to the coast?</font>

353
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know it's dangerous, but we can handle it.</font>

354
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then I can't meet Doctor Hogback! </font>

355
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna meet him!</font>

356
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no, I know how you feel.</font>

357
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this time we gotta rely on our special ability, the "something's fishy here” sensor!</font>

358
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you die to meet that doctor...</font>

359
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you survive and not meet him so you can leave the island...</font>

360
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which do you pick?</font>

361
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I don't wanna die.</font>

362
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm too scared.</font>

363
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, is that so?</font>

364
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that is what you wish...</font>

365
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, please wait here.</font>

366
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop the cart!</font>

367
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for taking away your chance, Chopper...</font>

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay, I'm just no good at running off and doing my own thing like Luffy does...</font>

369
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,300
<font face="impress bt" size="45">10 minutes later...</font>

370
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font color="#73b8fd"><font size="70">Silence...</font></font></font>

371
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's weird, all he was doing was turning it...</font>

372
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nobody there!</font>

373
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The horses are gone too!</font>

374
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're all alone in the middle of a graveyard!</font>

375
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

376
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How?</font>

377
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He abandoned us?</font>

378
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Maybe he just went to the bathroom!</font>

379
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hildon!</font>

380
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where'd you go?</font>

381
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why a graveyard, of all places?</font>

382
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

383
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... no way!</font>

384
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zo...</font>

385
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies!</font>

386
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow!</font>

387
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

388
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gonna tip the cart!</font>

389
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys're really strong!</font>

390
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He bit me!</font>

391
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, he bit me!</font>

392
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I'm gonna turn into a zombie!</font>

393
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Usopp!</font>

394
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll save you!</font>

395
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, don't!</font>

396
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

397
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

398
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let Usopp go!</font>

399
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

400
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

401
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you dropped this.</font>

402
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks.</font>

403
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

404
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gonna bite me!</font>

405
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

406
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go...</font>

407
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay back!</font>

408
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A zombie's weakness is...</font>

409
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly...</font>

410
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flame Star!</font>

411
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

412
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Careful, you'll burn up!</font>

413
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked a lot better than I'd thought...</font>

414
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you do that to us, bastard!</font>

415
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What would you've done if you'd hit us, idiot?!</font>

416
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You rotten person!</font>

417
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now the zombies are really mad!</font>

418
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Nami!</font>

419
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let’s get away now!</font>

420
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that we're this far, it's closest to just run to the mansion!</font>

421
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, let's do that!</font>

422
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was scary...</font>

423
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright!</font>

424
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once we get out of the graveyard, we'll be fine if we run as fast as we can!</font>

425
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All zombies can do is groan and walk really slowly!</font>

426
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slowly, slowly!</font>

427
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you bastard!</font>

428
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're fast!</font>

429
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm tired...</font>

430
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have no stamina!</font>

431
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think... we lost them...</font>

432
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is wrong with this island?</font>

433
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just covered with things that shouldn't be alive...</font>

434
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, guys...</font>

435
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I turn into a zombie, then you can just-</font>

436
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

437
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I read it in a book on zombies I found in Sunny's library.</font>

438
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For being scared of these things, you sure read a lot about them.</font>

439
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, here we are.</font>

440
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just want a glass of water.</font>

441
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can finally meet him!</font>

442
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is great!</font>

443
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet that on an island like this...</font>

444
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't find a single honest person living on it.</font>

445
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse us!</font>

446
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this Mr. Doctor Hogback's mansion?</font>
