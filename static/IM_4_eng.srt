00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prisoner number E 8200,</font>

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the pirate, Buggy the Clown...</font>

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,610

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, Straw Hat Luffy and Mr. 2 Bon Kurei are causing an uproar in the N-sector of Level 3.</font>

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Blugori can't restrain them!</font>

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems the two of them are headed for the stairs to Level 4.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>However, we've yet to locate the pirate, Buggy the Clown and Galdino, Mr. 3.</i></font>

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things've gotten pretty interesting around here.</font>

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great way to kill some time.</font>

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll all be over for'em anyway, once they get caught.</font>

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to Saldeath?</font>

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Blugori couldn't stop Straw Hat Luffy and Mr. 2, so...</font>

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...he's gone to suppress the uproar in Level 2.</font>

25
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did nobody report the situation to me before it got this bad?!</font>

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were so focused on Hancock-dono that you ignored the reports, remember?</font>

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ignored the reports, you say?!</font>

28
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did the guests leave, Warden?</font>

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Sadi-chan.</font>

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salute the Jailer!</font>

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've finished preparing for the hunt...</font>

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what should we do?</font>

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perfect timing. Is anyone on Level 3?</font>

34
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Minotaurus...</font>

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">went there.</font>

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. But there's a way out of Level 3.</font>

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose he won't be able to pursue them.</font>

38
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll leave the fracas on Level 2 to Saldeath...</font>

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send all remaining Impel Down staff here to Level 4!</font>

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood, Sir!</font>

41
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they manage to escape from the Minotaurus and fall down here...</font>

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll finish them off personally in Inferno Hell!</font>

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've underestimated this Great Prison, Impel Down!</font>

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's with this thing? It sure is fast!</font>

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Minotaurus!</font>

46
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Minotaurus?</font>

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A cold-blooded Demon Guard!</font>

48
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A monster that tosses people like trash!</font>

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what it is!</font>

50
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,090
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Jailer Beast</font>

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,090

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}A monster? A Devil Fruit user?</font>

53
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan!</font>

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurt!</font>

55
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing's fast!</font>

56
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan, watch out!</font>

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tamer's Whip!</font>

58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... dying...</font>

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second...</font>

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet...</font>

62
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bazooka!</font>

63
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You alright, Bon-chan?</font>

64
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I thought I was dying...</font>

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw a field of Okama before my eyes...</font>

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are strong...</font>

67
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that monster is still alive, but he must be hurt.</font>

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What?!</font>

69
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so angry!  This is just awful!</font>

70
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My makeup is ruined!</font>

71
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cosmetics, cosmetics! I need cosmetics!</font>

72
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That, and my toe-shoes, clothes, weapons, and...</font>

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">booze, tears, and Okama Way!</font>

74
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna get down from here now.  I'm thirsty and hungry!</font>

75
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no cause for concern, Straw-chan!</font>

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Getting from Level 3 to
Level 4 is as easy as throwing up!</font>

77
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?!</font>

78
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep! Too, too easy! So easy! Way too easy!</font>

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is, Straw-chan.</font>

80
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just climb the great, big wall over there.</font>

81
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wall? You mean up there?</font>

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

83
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't get so excited that you leap over it.</font>

84
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

85
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot hot hot hot HOT!</font>

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that wall?</font>

87
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's as hot as a frying pan!</font>

88
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A frying pan, huh? That's exactly right, Straw-chan!</font>

89
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you alright?</font>

90
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ready, and...</font>

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

92
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See this, Straw-chan? Look down there.</font>

93
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this place?</font>

94
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's so much hot air and smoke!</font>

95
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too hot to stand up!</font>

96
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right?</font>

97
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, the place below us is, indeed, where you wanted to go: Level 4, the Inferno Hell!</font>

98
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Inferno.  That's below here?</font>

99
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  As you said,</font>

100
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level 4 is a massive frying pan.</font>

101
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A sea of boiling blood and fire wait for you down there.</font>

102
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can try jumping down there, if you like,</font>

103
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if you don't take care in landing, you won't escape with just a burn.</font>

104
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beyond this point, every move forward is risking your life.</font>

105
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan,</font>

106
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you said there was someone you wanted to see, right?</font>

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to know who this guy is you're risking your life to see.</font>

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People call him a "Miracle Man".</font>

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Locked away for a crime he didn't commit, he is known as Iva-san!</font>

110
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Queen of Kamabakka Queendom on Momoiro Island in the Grand Line!</font>

111
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The great Okama Queen, admired by all Okama in the world!</font>

112
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okama Queen?</font>

113
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okama have queens? Awesome!</font>

114
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

115
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to meet him!</font>

116
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if I can, I'd like to save him!</font>

117
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey wait!  We were in such a nice mood here, and you go and bring THAT thing back here?!</font>

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you were trying to escape!</font>

119
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">STRAW HAT!</font>

120
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you wanna come along after all?</font>

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if anyone'd wanna go to Hell!</font>

122
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were just hiding, and this thing just came flying at us!</font>

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno why, though...</font>

124
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I sent him flying at you.</font>

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so it was you then?  WAIT JUST A MINUTE?!</font>

126
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough of this...</font>

127
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather just get caught...</font>

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Minotaurus, you... damn monster...</font>

129
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My life's at stake here...</font>

130
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got no choice but to reveal my trump card!</font>

131
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hat!</font>

132
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You remember my super-powerful weapon,</font>

133
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that I used to strike fear into your heart, my Special Buggy-ball?</font>

134
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah.</font>

135
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...What? Uh...</font>

136
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had this really powerful cannonball called the Buggy-ball, you see...</font>

137
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was like, my favorite weapon and stuff...</font>

138
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Buggy-ball...</font>

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you gave it your own name,</font>

140
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that must mean that you have a lot of faith in this Buggy-ball of yours, right?</font>

141
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Exactly!</font>

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I've made a new weapon that lets me store a mini-version with the same power in my own body!</font>

143
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The "Muggy-Ball"!</font>

144
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You changed the name?!</font>

145
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

146
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Special Muggy-Ball!</font>

147
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked!</font>

149
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's how it works.</font>

150
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's that? Remembered it yet, Straw Hat?</font>

151
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap! It's still conscious?!</font>

152
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it, Straw-chan!</font>

153
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Three! You really can't use your Candle powers here?</font>

154
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll melt in just three seconds!</font>

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll have to do it in three seconds.</font>

156
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flying, I'm flying! My flying Okama Kenpo!</font>

157
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Memoir of that Winter-Sky!</font>

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here I go, Straw Hat!</font>

159
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle Lock!</font>

160
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

161
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

162
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hammer Rifle!</font>

163
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it!</font>

164
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We beat a monster from hell!</font>

165
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Now let's get going down to Level 4!</font>

166
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Level 4.</font>

167
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All our forces have assembled here except Warden Magellan.</font>

168
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away,</font>

169
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...!</font>

170
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much time is left before his execution?</font>

171
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">29 hours.</font>

172
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tomorrow at 15:00, this will all be over.</font>

173
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, that's assuming nothing goes wrong.</font>

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll transfer Portgas D. Ace tomorrow morning.</font>

175
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as you are alright, I...</font>

177
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-Admiral Momonga!</font>

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

179
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Red Hair has apparently gotten involved in a fight in the New World!</font>

180
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Red Hair?</font>

181
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure about that?</font>

182
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why now?</font>

183
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Against who?</font>

184
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... the Yonkou Kaidou!</font>

185
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kaidou?!</font>

186
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to HQ, Kaidou said he was gonna take down Whitebeard, and Red Hair stopped him.</font>

187
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, it wasn't a very large battle...</font>

188
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sort of thing was bound to happen!</font>

189
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, how uneasy this sea has become.</font>

190
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With all that's going on now, we can't deal with fights between the Yonkou!</font>

191
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's possible there's no way to avoid a fight with Whitebeard.</font>

192
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter who wins, this battle will be engraved in history.</font>

193
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry, and set sail for Marineford!</font>

194
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

195
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,600
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="50">Impel Down</font></font>

196
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,600
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="40">Inside the well-hole tower</font></font>

197
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times do I have to explain it, you freaking dumbass?!</font>

198
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you see that pillar of steam?!</font>

199
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Spinning, spinning, spinning-ing-ing!</font>

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Inferno Hell down there!</font>

201
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not going!</font>

202
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not to a place like Level 4!</font>

203
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

204
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaddaya mean "Why"?!</font>

205
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're trying to break out!</font>

206
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Break. Out. {I don't think I understand the reason for the tlc here. It makes sense as is.}</font>

207
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wanna go up!</font>

208
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up, fool!</font>

209
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, what a huge blood booger...</font>

210
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you listening?!</font>

211
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give it up, Straw-chan.</font>

212
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need those spineless wimps.</font>

213
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">WHO YOU CALLIN' A BIG-NOSED WIMP?!</font>

214
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?! How could you possibly mistake what I said for THAT?!</font>

215
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've decided! I'm going 'round and 'round!</font>

216
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ain't no joke!</font>

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, the ceiling just keeps getting higher and higher...</font>

218
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right...</font>

219
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was just wondering what kind of trick they were using to cause that cracking-sound...</font>

220
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're the ones falling down!</font>

221
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! My Muggy-Ball was too powerful, and it caused the floor to crumble!</font>

222
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no, it was because my kicks were too fierce!</font>

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're wrong, it was because my punch was too strong!</font>

224
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no, no... It was because my wax-powers were-</font>

225
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right, never mind.</font>

226
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't you, okay?!</font>

227
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna fall into the fire!</font>

228
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help us!</font>

229
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,880
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="50">“Pool of Blood“</font></font>

230
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, cut it out!</font>

231
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll die!</font>

232
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just getting what's coming to you.</font>

233
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many people have <i>you</i> killed up 'til now?</font>

234
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it.</font>

235
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've had plenty of time to reflect over what we did!</font>

236
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! We're sorry!</font>

237
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!</font>

238
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">IT'S HOT! IT'S SO HOT!</font>

239
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">SAVE US!</font>

240
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry the logs over there!</font>

241
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No slacking off!</font>

242
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So hot... It feels like my organs are boiling!</font>

243
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This floor is more painful than dying!</font>

244
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough!</font>

245
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make way! Move it!</font>

246
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A prisoner is trying to escape!</font>

247
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, move it!</font>

248
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna get thrown into the sea of fire?!</font>

249
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You scum! Prisoners aren't allowed to harm other prisoners!</font>

250
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna get executed right now?!</font>

251
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,570
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Former Baroque Works
Assassin, Daz Bones</font>

253
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

254
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Magellan, Hannyabal and all the
Demon Guards are gathered here!</font>

255
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's gonna happen here on this floor?</font>

256
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,750
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Passage connecting level 3 and level 4</font>

257
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It sure is hot down here!</font>

258
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get your protective clothes on!</font>

259
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw Hat Luffy and the others make it down here, it'll be through this door.</font>

260
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still no reports?</font>

261
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps the Minotaurus killed them?</font>

262
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden, what're you doing, hiding in there like that?</font>

263
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, and come out.</font>

264
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't just open it all of a sudden!</font>

265
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's too bright!</font>

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden, about that Warden's seat...</font>

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I take over your job, please change it to a less confined one.</font>

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence. This is the Warden's special seat.</font>

269
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to remain in a closed-up area.</font>

270
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather close my heart to you, too.</font>

271
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we were gonna wait for this long, it'd have been better to just head...</font>

272
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">straight to Level 3.</font>

273
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, don't be so impatient, Sadi-chan.</font>

274
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not me, I mean these kids.</font>

275
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can't hold back their bloodthirstiness...</font>

276
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for very long.</font>

277
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Jailer Beast</font>

278
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,300
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Minokoala (Feasty)</font>

279

280

282
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,320

283
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporting in!</font>

284
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It appears that Straw Hat Luffy has entered the Vent Column in Level 3,</font>

285
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">though we haven't been able to contact the surveillance.</font>

286
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If so, then he'll save us a lot of trouble if he falls down here.</font>

287
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Pool of Blood beneath him.</font>

288
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys all have Devil Fruit powers,</font>

289
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so if they fall in, they're dead.</font>

290
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan! I have something to report!</font>

291
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The intruder, Straw Hat Luffy, has already reached this floor!</font>

292
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

293
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?!</font>

294
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems he fell down from the Vent Column.</font>

295
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the Pool of Blood was right below the hole!</font>

296
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How'd he survive?!</font>

297
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just guessing, but he might have been able to leap to safety from the giant rock that fell down with them.</font>

298
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They got lucky.</font>

299
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also...</font>

300
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

301
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden, you stink!</font>

302
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I messed up.</font>

303
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, this is such a pain!</font>

304
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Demon Guard, the Minotaurus, seems to have been immobilized and has fallen down with them.</font>

305
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way?! Did they defeat him?!</font>

306
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably.</font>

307
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That can't be! I refuse to believe it!</font>

308
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down!</font>

309
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they intend to escape from Level 4,</font>

310
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there are only two stairs they can use without security approval.</font>

311
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will split the forces here into three squads.</font>

312
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hannyabal, I'll leave the protection of this staircase leading to Level 3 to you.</font>

313
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sadi-chan, you take the Demon Guards and guard the stairs leading to Level 5.</font>

314
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding! I don't want to stand guard...</font>

315
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to attack them!</font>

316
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no meaning to my life if I can't attack them, Warden!</font>

317
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they come here, I'll just let them escape and push the blame on the Warden...</font>

318
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got any complaints?</font>

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, please stop...</font>

320
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">sighing!</font>

321
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you breathing on me too?</font>

322
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My instincts told me that you had evil intentions.</font>

323
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can do whatever you want once you've captured them.</font>

324
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great! I can't wait!</font>

325
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All remaining Jailers, chase after them!</font>

326
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have permission to kill them!</font>

327
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

328
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But please, don't kill them completely!</font>

329
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't underestimate me,
Straw Hat Luffy and your gang!</font>

330
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you have your way any longer!</font>

331
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will settle this here, in Inferno Hell!</font>

332
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

333
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up with this corridor, it's flashily hot!</font>

334
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,990
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Near the "Pool of Blood"</font>

335
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}The air is so hot, even my lungs feel hot!</font>

336
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Hurry up! We've gotta hurry and get out of here!</font>

337
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Which way should we go?</font>

338
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are just helpless!</font>

339
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you clear your mind, the fire is just another Okama.</font>

340
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not that I don't understand how you feel, though.</font>

341
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This floor is even hotter than the one above us.</font>

342
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It IS kinda hot...</font>

343
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I DO kinda feel like I'm getting roasted here...</font>

344
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HOT!!!</font>

345
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAN'T STAND THE HEAT!</font>

346
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there! Let's go!</font>

347
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where're you going?!</font>

348
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HOT!!!</font>

349
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet!</font>

350
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">HOT!!!</font>

351
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait... The place Straw-chan is running towards...</font>

367
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fantastic! If they've got some booze there, it'll be perfect!</font>

372
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">We've found him!</font>

373
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

374
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure are a lot of 'em!</font>

376
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop him!</font>

380
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a good look.</font>

381
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy are dropping like flies.</font>

382

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's not a single Jailer guarding the fiery torture pits.</font>

384
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up there! They're up there!</font>

385
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to find out where the exit is while we have the chance!</font>

386
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We might get ambushed and trapped here on this floor!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ambushed in Level 4?!</font>

388
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're after Straw Hat, right?!</font>

389
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was just an accident that got us here!</font>

390
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regardless, we've tried to escape, so both our names and faces have been revealed.</font>

391
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm afraid that...</font>

392
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there's a high chance that they've gathered</font>

393
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the All-Stars of Impel Down here on this floor, to take care off the riot.</font>

394
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The remaining three Demon Guards are a given...</font>

395
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if Warden Magellan also shows up, we're done for!</font>

396
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way!</font>

397
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn... I thought that was a spear or something...</font>

398
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

399
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jelly? Poop?</font>
