<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable... He's been forcing him to obey
by threatening his siblings?</font>

140
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you for the last time!  Crush Shirahoshi!</font>

143
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You became his slave... to protect your siblings?</font>

144
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see, of course you want to protect them.</font>

145
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they your younger siblings?  Or older?</font>

146
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me protect them too!</font>

147
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,750

148
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill him!</font>

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get in his way!</font>

156
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop Straw Hat!</font>

157
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  He disappeared!</font>

158
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

159
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now I'm really fired up!</i></font>

165
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,290

166
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who'd do this... and how?!</font>

167
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is terrible!</font>

168
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it, Father?</font>

169
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, this is strange, but why are you so upset?</font>

170
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just some old wreckage.  It isn't important.</font>

171
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're wrong.
We mustn't let anything happen to that ship -jamon!</font>

179
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,490

180
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  And it only took one hit!</font>

181
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That won't work on me...</font>

184
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  It's because you rely on fake power!</font>

202
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's clearly falling toward the plaza!</font>

203
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's going to break the bubble around the island!</font>

204
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island will be destroyed without the bubble!</font>

236
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I even attacked him using the Color of Arms.</font>

237
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decken, is it?  That insane pirate!</font>

238
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This wasn't part of the plan!</font>

242
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wadatsumi?</font>

243
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no longer possible to save you!</font>

244
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You will become a sacrifice for the death
of Shirahoshi, just like the rest of Fishman Island!</font>

245
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

246
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're done for!  The bubble won't hold!</font>

247
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the end!</font>

248
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where'd Princess Shirahoshi go?</font>

249
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's gone!</font>

250
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  The Princess!  Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

251
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Shirahoshi disappeared?!</font>

252
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Impossible!</font>

253
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,180

262
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then the people of Ryuuguu Kingdom should not be caught up in it.</font>

267
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was planning to crush the whole island, and us with it.</font>

268
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He betrayed me!</font>

269
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, she's going to sacrifice herself for us!</font>

270
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't there anything we can do to help her?</font>

272
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, how completely beautiful you are, Shirahoshi!  Even your heart shines with it!</font>

273
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're trying to avert this disaster
and save your country all by yourself, Shirahoshi?</font>

274
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

275
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shira... hoshi.</font>

276
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You truly are
worthy of becoming Vander Decken the Ninth's wife!</font>

277
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die at the height of your beauty, and live on forever in my heart!</font>

278
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

279
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!</font>

280
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Weak-hoshi...
Even after I told her to stay close to me!</font>

281
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat is...</font>

282
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hody!</font>

283
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Huh?  Hody-san isn't here!</font>

284
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look up in the sky!  There he is!</font>

285
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Under Noah?!</font>

286
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're completely insane, Vander Decken.</font>

287
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, this is a great trump card!</font>

288
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard... How dare he harm Shirahoshi-chan?!</font>

289
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, wait!</font>

290
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll jump up there!  You take care of the plaza!</font>

291
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

292
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But anyway Luffy, the ship is underwater!</font>

293
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think there's water inside the ship too, Jinbe?</font>

294
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not sure, but Decken is a Devil Fruit user...</font>

295
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so we can assume that there must be air in there somewhere since he can make the ship move.</font>

296
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're going to go, take this.</font>

297
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a coral that creates a bubble.</font>

298
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

299
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I leave my beloved Shirahoshi-chan to you!</font>

300
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna fling you, Luffy!</font>

301
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it!</font>
