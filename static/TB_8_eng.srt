00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,890

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Damn it! We've been found!</font>

64
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We screamed!</font>

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The demon has awakened!</font>

66
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Kumashi!</font>

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me you've been hiding those pirates!</font>

68
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My bride!</font>

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why's she here?!</font>

70
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Splendid!</font>

71
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What violence!</font>

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a masterpiece!</font>

73
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Truly a devil!</font>

74
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meat!</font>

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm hungry!</font>

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Where did the pirates...? Where did my bride go?!</font>

77
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They ran at full speed!</font>

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They sure are fast!</font>

79
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't escape!</font>

80
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, food!</font>

81
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's this Sanji?</font>

82
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened...?</font>

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened just now?</font>

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It started moving as soon as Luffy's shadow was inserted!</font>

85
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's how zombies work!</font>

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was what Dr. Hogback meant by "giving back life!"</font>

87
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That huge man's ability...</font>

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's probably a devil fruit ability!</font>

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact his first word was "meat" means...</font>

90
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That giant monster without a doubt holds Luffy's personality.</font>

91
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, right.</font>

92
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, if I remember correctly...</font>

93
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Sanji-like penguin we met at the bridge...</font>

94
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even if I die...</i></font>

95
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I won't hurt a lady!</i></font>

96
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!</font>

97
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, Sanji's shadow was embedded into it.</font>

98
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most likely.</font>

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, the samurai who hit us with the back of the sword...</font>

100
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Brook!</font>

101
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incredible!</font>

102
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So all those strange incidents were tied together.</font>

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These terrible zombies are just a game to him!</font>

104
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just toying with people's lives!</font>

105
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What "mankind dream"...!</font>

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What "bringing back the dead"...!</font>

107
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dr. Hogback is a great man!</i></font>

108
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I highly respect him!</i></font>

109
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't want to help anyone in the least!</font>

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just another villain!</font>

111
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper...</font>

112
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the time to be crying over that.</font>

113
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our friends are becoming victims of this zombie game!</font>

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand?</font>

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to save them!</font>

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

117
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to where Luffy's being transported!</font>

118
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yea, they said to "take them back to the ship"!</font>

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if they meant the Sunny?</font>

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the same thing happened to Zoro and Sanji...</font>

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must be there as well!</font>

122
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!</font>

123
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go help 'em!</font>

124
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

125
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

126
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?!</font>

127
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

128
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts, what're you-?!</font>

129
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me!</font>

130
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy...!</font>

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What strength!</font>

132
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you done saying goodbye?</font>

133
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today I'll marry this woman.</font>

134
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot...</font>

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the manly Usopp, there's no point in living...</font>

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he can't protect even one woman!</font>

137
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, that weapon...!</font>

138
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

139
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Six Chambered Viper Star!</font>

140
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's disappearing again!</font>

141
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Even me?</font>

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami disappeared too!</font>

143
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

144
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?!</font>

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

146
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her scent is being erased by another smell!</font>

147
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

148
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Cho-!</font>

149
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Nami, what's wrong?!</font>

150
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?!</font>

151
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me, Nami!</font>

152
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies!</font>

153
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll leave them to you.</font>

154
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take those two to Moria-sama!</font>

155
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

156
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's he talking from?!</font>

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! An armored zombie?!</font>

158
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More zombies are coming from below!</font>

159
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies are coming from above too!</font>

160
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, pirates...!</font>

161
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hand over your shadows!</font>

162
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get caught, they'll steal our shadows!</font>

163
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yea.</font>

164
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's also portrait zombies!</font>

165
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

166
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's unfair to make an undead dog-pile!</font>

167
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unfair!</font>

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just gonna take your shadow, bro.</font>

169
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, let me go!</font>

170
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

171
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, someone's there!</font>

172
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're purifying the others!</font>

173
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get your dirty hands off...</font>

174
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My little brothers!</font>

175
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're these guys?!</font>

176
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're extremely dangerous!</font>

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B...!</font>

178
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Bro!</font>

179
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin!</font>

180
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't we make it on time?</font>

181
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's one missing.</font>

182
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp.</font>

183
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper.</font>

184
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you hurt?</font>

185
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible!</font>

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aside from the Humming One, other bastards who know our weak point have appeared!</font>

187
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible!</font>

188
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"We can't die" was our catchphrase, I don't wanna spend my days in fear of annihilation!</font>

189
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that those whose shadows were taken are carried past these long stairs.</font>

190
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, Luffy was transported through here!</font>

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were going after him, but then Nami...!</font>

192
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if Nami's okay...</font>

193
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't like he wanted to exterminate her. We'll definitely be back to rescue her!</font>

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way...</font>

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That monster-like growl coming from upstairs...</font>

196
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was it?</font>

197
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we went there after we heard it.</font>

198
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was Luffy's voice...</font>

199
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll tell you everything we witnessed.</font>

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway... something terrible has happened!</font>

201
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep delivering more!</font>

202
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He hasn't had enough yet!</font>

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much can the Special Zombie eat?!</font>

204
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gonna eat the whole island's provisions!</font>

205
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an amazing appetite.</font>

206
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kumashi, why were you hiding those pirates?!</font>

207
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... that's...</font>

208
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop talking, it's un-cute!</font>

209
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, tiny leek.</font>

210
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know you and yet you're feeding me.</font>

211
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though it tastes terrible and isn't enough.</font>

212
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you Special Zombie!</font>

213
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't act so cheeky!</font>

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who do you think makes us, zombies, move?!</font>

215
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you even complain to the ruler of Thriller Bark?!</font>

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Master will someday become ruler of this sea-</font>

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really sorry!</font>

218
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy said all that!</font>

219
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, don't sell out your friends!</font>

220
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, Oars.</font>

221
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">500 years ago you were a huge villain who left numerous legends behind.</font>

222
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now you've been resurrected to become my servant in this present day.</font>

223
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Servant?</font>

224
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want that.</font>

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a dream.</font>

226
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen such an insolent zombie!</font>

227
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's cramped and boring here.</font>

228
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna go outside for a bit.</font>

229
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe go out to sea and go around the world.</font>

230
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Going on a trip?!</font>

231
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You blockhead, that's impossible.</font>

232
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This special freezer is made from super dense steel and it's completely sealed.</font>

233
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't be able to scratch it in the leas-</font>

234
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

235
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pistol!</font>

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! Wait!</font>

237
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible, Oars has escaped!</font>

238
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strange...</font>

239
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had a feeling that my arm would stretch but... well, whatever.</font>

240
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna be... the Pirate King!</font>

241
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like then...</font>

242
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pleading "not the afro", "not the afro"... You'll wind up shamelessly begging me for your life again.</font>

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't go that way!</font>

245
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's pointless.</i></font>

246
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even if I muster my courage and cut them, those scary zombies keep getting up!</i></font>

247
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They definitely must have a weakness.</i></font>

248
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>At this rate, even if I find my own zombie, there wouldn't be anything I could do.</i></font>

249
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>More than anything, zombies' faces are just too scary!</i></font>

250
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>One of ours was purified!</i></font>

251
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What happened?!</i></font>

252
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He was hungry and ate some salty grilled fish.</i></font>

253
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Idiot, he was a newcomer.</i></font>

254
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This must be the zombies' weakness!</i></font>

255
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You! You're the skeleton whose shadow we stole a few days ago.</i></font>

256
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How did you get back here?</i></font>

257
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Answer my question!</i></font>

258
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Which zombie has my shadow?</i></font>

259
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you don't answer, I'll scatter fish all over the island!</i></font>

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Fish...?</i></font>

261
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And how's that gonna affect me?</i></font>

262
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's...</i></font>

263
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No way...</i></font>

264
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But, I don't think it could be salt...</i></font>

265
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Salt...?</i></font>

266
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A-And h-how is salt g-gonna do any good?!</i></font>

267
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's salt!</i></font>

268
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Zombies are really, really scary after all.</i></font>

269
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's even worse during the night.</i></font>

270
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What, it was just a grasshopper.</i></font>

271
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It scared me.</i></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nonetheless, it's even more dangerous when the sun is shining, and it's easy to be found by the enemy.</i></font>

273
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's it!</i></font>

274
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sing!</i></font>

275
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>When you're scared you should sing a song to take your mind off things!</i></font>

276
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll be able to purify them if I don't look at their faces by using my skeleton speed.</i></font>

277
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then, I'll definitely find my shadow!</i></font>

278
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's this song?</i></font>

279
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Someone's humming.</i></font>

280
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who is it?!</i></font>

281
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's wrong?!</i></font>

282
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's all the ruckus on the island about?!</i></font>

283
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>There's a warrior with a scary face who appears when you hear humming in the darkness!</i></font>

284
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's going around trying to find his shadow!</i></font>

285
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He already annihilated most of the Soldier Zombies!</i></font>

286
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please do something!</i></font>

287
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Perona-sama, there's trouble...</i></font>

288
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shut up!</i></font>

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't wake me, Kumashi...</i></font>

290
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please wake up...</i></font>

291
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We finally meet.</i></font>

292
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's with this strength?</i></font>

293
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Isn't this my zombie...?</i></font>

294
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't keep up with him at all!</i></font>

295
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even though we share the same sword style!</i></font>

296
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Give up.</i></font>

297
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Regardless of how many times you try, it'll be the same.</i></font>

298
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you try to move quicker, I'll cut off that ridiculous afro of yours.</i></font>

299
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>P-Please don't!</i></font>

300
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please don't touch the afro!</i></font>

301
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please!</i></font>

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why don't you know?!</i></font>

303
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you're my shadow, then why don't you know how important this afro is?</i></font>

304
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Since my body no longer ages, it'll never grow again!</i></font>

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why, you ask?</i></font>

306
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've forgotten everything about my days with you.</i></font>

307
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Right now, I only obey Moriah-sama and Absalom-sama!</i></font>

308
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A skeleton who treasures his afro is nothing but a joke to me!</i></font>

309
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop!</i></font>

310
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Not the afro!</i></font>

311
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Not the afro!</i></font>

312
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Not the afro!</i></font>

313
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Not the afro!</i></font>

314
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What a miserable look, my former master.</i></font>

315
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm sorry... I've lost...</i></font>

316
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please let me off...</i></font>

317
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll leave this island immediately.</i></font>

318
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then, get out of my sight.</i></font>

319
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It'll be troublesome for me if you die.</i></font>

320
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a pathetic sight.</font>

321
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say anything you want.</font>

322
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These past five years...</font>

323
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just for this moment...!</font>

324
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I became stronger!</font>

325
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama.</font>

326
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is everything ready for the ceremony?</font>

327
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anytime you want.</font>

328
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a beautiful bride!</font>

329
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll start the ceremony immediately.</font>

330
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put her in a dress and bring her to the ceremonial hall.</font>

331
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, right away.</font>

332
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A monster bigger than giants?!</font>

333
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

334
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That incredible noise and roar were his doing.</font>

335
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can only imagine that's Luffy's zombie roaring and rampaging.</font>

336
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry!</font>

337
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look!</font>

338
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's the Sunny!</font>

339
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you head straight up you'll find the boss's room.</font>

341
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are those stairs used for unloading?</font>

342
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

343
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole place has been messed up!</font>

344
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt it's the zombies' doing.</font>

345
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's full of muddy footprints.</font>

346
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, they might still be there...</font>

347
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A complete mess indeed.</font>

348
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's barely anything left.</font>

349
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there any zombie around...?</font>

350
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all, where could they be...?</font>

351
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't see them.</font>

352
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

353
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

354
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

355
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, they're in the dining room!</font>

357
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three of them!</font>

358
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies completely re-decorated them.</font>

359
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pitiful.</font>

360
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up!</font>

361
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't time the for a nap!</font>

362
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have serious problems!</font>

363
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're still asleep.</font>

364
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they feel anything at all?</font>

365
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be helped.</font>

366
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, step back, I'm gonna use the bazooka.</font>

367
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's fine.</font>

368
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A beautiful female swordmaster has brought a lot of meat!</font>

369
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful?</font>

370
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meat?</font>

371
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swordmaster?</font>

372
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're hopeless!</font>
