00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is hard to control.</font>

131
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um...</font>

132
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait up, leaving me behind like that was mean, grand master!</font>

133
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, I am a man, and I can put up barriers...</font>

134
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...</font>

135
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

136
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me?</font>

137
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Sabo.</font>

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,730
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Revolutionary Army
Chief of Staff

Sabo</font>

139
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:46,730
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Revolutionary Army
Hack</font>

140
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}We're warriors from the revolutionary army. {Cecil: It dosen't say Fishman Karate substitute teacher on Koala? That's kinda a shame, since I thought that was a cool fact}</font>

141
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then the first Lucy...</font>

142
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The first Lucy was the man who will one day become the Pirate King, with a bounty of 400 million,</font>

143
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

144
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A pirate?!</font>

145
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's my little brother.</font>

146
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care of him.</font>

147
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy is a nice guy, isn't he?</font>

148
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He hasn't gotten any less reckless either.
He's exactly the same.</font>

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're pretty reckless yourself, Sabo-kun.</font>

150
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

151
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is the revolutionary army in this country?</font>

152
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The weapons shipped from this port are prolonging wars all around the world.</font>

154
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We... came to stop it.</font>

155
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The revolutionary army has sent soldiers 
to this country several times,</font>

156
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but since they were all turned into toys, 
we could never unveil this black market.</font>

157
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that guy's dangerous.</font>

158
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's Sabo, isn't it?!</font>

159
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the revolutionary army's number two doing here?</font>

160
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta tell the young master.</font>

161
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it looks like the weapons are being made somewhere else.</font>

162
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are these weapons being made?</font>

163
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we could find out, it'd make a great gift to Dragon-san.</font>

164
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,430
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Royal Palace</font>

165
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, how dare you kill the young master?!</font>

166
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna blow you away!</font>

167
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buffalo!</font>

168
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Traf!</font>

169
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came to save you!</font>

170
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?!</font>

171
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you're alive!</font>

172
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't have any business up here, Straw Hat!</font>

173
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to the factory?</font>

174
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you destroy it?</font>

175
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the key to his handcuffs.</font>

176
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've prepared for everything.</font>

177
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait right there, Straw Hat! Violet!</font>

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you lay a finger on the young ma-</font><font size="20"></font>

179
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master...</font>

180
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku, sorry to have kept you waiting.</font>

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just wait a sec, I'll get you out right away.</font>

182
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry you've come all this way,
 but our alliance is over.</font>

183
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of here.</font>

184
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well you're pretty selfish. I'm the one who decides those things, so shut up!</font>

185
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's the selfish one?!</font>

186
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and unlock the cuffs.</font>

187
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah.</font>

188
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our alliance is over.
That means we're enemies again.</font>

189
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you let me go, I'll kill you.</font>

190
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't move!</font>

191
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't touch Sea Stone, 
so unlocking this is tricky.</font>

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay steady.</font>

193
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys even listening to me?!</font>

194
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the stone guy. {Xemnas: I was just waiting for someone to stomp on his head and say "Shut up!" when he was doing the whole evil laugh.}</font>

195
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Pica!</font>

196
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've screwed me over far beyond my imagination.</font>

197
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mingo's alive!</font>

198
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master!</font>

199
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master!</font>

200
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of body does he have?!</font>

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to the release of the toys, the country is in a state of chaos.</font>

202
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I don't know why, but the revolutionary army also seems to have invaded.</font>

203
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a bad situation.</font>

204
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to use the bird cage.</font>

205
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bird cage?!</font>

206
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Law?</font>

207
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,570
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Smile Factory</font>

208
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}What are we gonna do? 
 The guys who were toys...</font>

209
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are attacking the factory!</font>

210
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.</font>

211
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can get in here without the keys.</font>

212
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This factory is as important as life itself to the young master.</font>

213
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it's made of Sea Stone. Even the ceiling caving in wouldn't damage it.</font>

214
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And last, but not least...</font>

215
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got two top commanders protecting us!</font>

216
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can defeat those two!</font>

217
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This factory's protection is impenetrable!</font>

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it was you.</font>

222
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you doing well?</font>

223
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

224
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sabo and Hack, you haven't changed.</font>

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

226
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you meet up with Luffy?</font>

227
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

228
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that guy.</font>

229
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our crewmate, Usopp.</font>

230
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just let him lie down.</font>

232

233
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,800

In front of the Rampart Tower</font>

235
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with the noise?</font>

236
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess something's going on down there.</font>

237
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, where the hell did that rock guy go?</font>

238

239
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,370

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You freak! {Xemnas: Fixed, but I think the wording needs a bit of work.}{Cecil: idk what the raw trans is, but would something like "Freaky Bastard!" (No idea if he says bastard) or even "You freak!"}</font>

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you still be alive, Doflamingo?!</font>

242
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Want me to teach you how to kill people?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as Pica is here, we can't get near Doflamingo.</font>

278
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's started...</font>

279
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bird cage!</font>

280
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, what's that?!</font>

281
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I know?!  
Anyway, we gotta get off the island! {I bet this guy is gonna be the pirate king. Just look at that 'stache.}</font>

282
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point trying to fight Doflamingo, he'll just kill us!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow!</font>

285

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-Blades?</font>

286
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What's with this fence?</font>

287
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo doesn't want the truth about this island to get out.</font>

288
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he's going to...</font>

289
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">kill every single person on the island.</font>

290
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fence has us completely surrounded.</font>

291
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the exit?!</font>

292
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

293
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-admiral Bastille. We can't contact HQ.</font>

294
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

295
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Likewise! We're not getting through to our base!</font>

296
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We haven't reported in to them yet.</font>

297
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What are you doing to the people?!</font>

298
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's not me! My body's moving on its own!</font>

299
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop it!</font>

300
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Why did I...</font>

301
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

302
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Get out of the way, everyone!</font>

303
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Parasite String.</font>

304
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporting in!</font>

305
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All across Dressrosa, people are indiscriminately attacking others!</font>

306
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even some of the marines have started going mad!</font>

307
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If this goes on, countless civilians will die!</font>

308
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What now?!</font>

309
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-The Royal Grounds are sinking!</font>

310
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, the ground's lowering itself!  
What's happening?!</font>

311
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Pica.</font>

312
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can change the whole terrain, as long as it's made of stone!</font>

313
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The palace is going off somewhere!</font>

314
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, palace!</font>

315
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The factory is rising!</font>

316
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?!</font>

317
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody...</font>

318
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop me!</font>

319
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flower Hill...</font>

320
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is growing and swallowing the city!</font>

321
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,590
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Royal Palace</font>

322
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Citizens of Dressrosa and visiting guests.</font>

323
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I could simply have ruled you with fear from the start.</font>

324
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that you know everything, I'm sure many of you want to kill me.</font>

325
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I've prepared a little game.</font>

326
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A game to kill me.</font>

327
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in the royal palace.</font>

328
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't run, nor will I hide.</font>

329
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can take my life, naturally the game will end.</font>

330
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there is one other way to end it.</font>

331
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is, if you take down every last one of the people I'm about to identify.</font>

332
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Furthermore, I will put a hefty bounty on each of their heads.</font>

333
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill, or be killed.</font>

334
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone in this country will become hunters.</font>

335
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no way out, except for you to kill!</font>
