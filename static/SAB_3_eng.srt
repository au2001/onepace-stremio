00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He knocked off Duval-sama's iron mask!</font>

134
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well... Take a close look at my scarred face!</font>

135
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the-?!?!?!</font>

136
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

137
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...!</font>

138
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My...</font>

139
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my...</font>

140
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna cry!</font>

141
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been waitin' for this day...</font>

142
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I decided to murder ya, and so I set out to sea!</font>

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But lookin' for ya would be a problem, y'know...</font>

144
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, yer wanted poster and yer true face didn't match!</font>

145
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if the marines or bounty hunters ran into ya, they just might' not notice ya!</font>

146
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah, there's no way that'd happen!</font>

147
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys'd definitely find ya!</font>

148
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head...!</font>

149
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'd find ya, and then they'd say...</font>

150
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Found you!"</font>

151
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Black Leg Sanji!"</font>

152
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then I'd tell 'em...</font>

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I dunno anyone like that!"</font>

154
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I ain't even a pirate!"</font>

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji, where are you going?!</font>

156
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do ya realise...</font>

157
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How frightenin' it was, suddenly bein' targeted by bounty hunters?!</font>

158
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

159
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd I suddenly have to be chased by the Navy HQ?!</font>

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd all those big name bounty hunters suddenly start huntin' me?!</font>

161
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?</font>

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What'd I do?!</font>

164
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me my life back!</font>

165
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg Sanji!</font>

166
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I care!</font>

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head!</font>

168
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaddaya mean, "Like I care"?!</font>

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If ya ain't gonna take responsibility for dis, then who will?!</font>

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm more pissed about that wanted-poster than anyone!</font>

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, things like this really can happen, huh?</font>

173
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a surprise...</font>

174
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This world is really big.</font>

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was Sanji born under some kind of miracle-star or something?</font>

176
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might meet quite an interesting end someday...</font>

177
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't help but feel sorry for that Duval guy...</font>

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those two look exactly like each other!</font>

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like two peas in a pod.</font>

180
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook! I'm so gonna kick the crap out of you afterwards!</font>

181
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, Sanji...</font>

182
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll just be going on ahead.</font>

183
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you saying this is my fault?!</font>

184
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't want to look like that wanted picture, you could just change your hairstyle or your beard!</font>

185
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of things you could just change!</font>

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I could have done that?</font>

187
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you all morons?!</font>

188
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not morons!</font>

189
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know, Black Leg, we...</font>

190
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We...</font>

191
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were running a small, unknown mafia in some distant corner of this sea...</font>

192
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We spent every single day by threatening the villagers for money...</font>

193
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was the kind of happy life we had.</font>

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg...</font>

195
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand?</font>

196
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I, who had never caused any kind of uproar...</font>

197
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Suddenly found myself with a bounty of 77 million...</font>

198
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And was chased around by those powerful marines...</font>

199
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got this nasty scar on my back,</font>

200
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and was forced to wear this iron mask to hide my face from the world!</font>

201
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's yer fault dat my life was ruined!</font>

202
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm prepared to chase ya to da ends of Hell!</font>

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If dat's a problem for ya...</font>

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then how about you just kill me right now?!</font>

205
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm bein' killed!</font>

206
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those stupid accusations of yours...</font>

207
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you even have to put Nami-san and Robin-chan in danger?!</font>

208
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dat ship and dat crew dat made ya a famous pirate!</font>

209
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I'd want revenge on'em!</font>

210
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ya guys should all die!</font>

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison harpoons?!</font>

212
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get in formation!</font>

213
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

214
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, crap!</font>

215
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun!</font>

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're trying to pull him down into the ocean!</font>

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji! Hurry up and get out of there!</font>

218
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, this net is made of steel!</font>

219
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now suffer and drown!</font>

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit... I'll save you right now!</font>

222
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go there yourself, idiot! I'll go get him!</font>

223
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

224
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You humans are too slow, you can't catch him!</font>

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave this to me!</font>

226
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool!</font>

227
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fishmen don't stand a chance at catching up!</font>

228
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Flying Fish are the fastest animals in the sea!</font>

229
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the Riders riding them have air canisters, so they can stay under water for as long as they like!</font>

230
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy doesn't stand a chance!</font>

231
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next time that guy, Black Leg surfaces...</font>

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll already have drowned and died!</font>

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that!?</font>

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feel the Head's anger, Black Leg!</font>

235
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't breathe...</font>

236
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay!</font>

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

238
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, cowboy!</font>

239
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that you forgot someone here!</font>

240
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

241
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Flying Fish are most certainly faster than fishmen.</font>

242
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're in the top-class among sea-creatures. They really are something!</font>

243
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

244
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The creatures at the very top of that top-class are the merfolk!</font>

245
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this great sea...</font>

246
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are no creatures that can outrun a mermaid under water!</font>

247
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright...</font>

248
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll save you right now, Sanji-chin!</font>

249
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is she really that incredible?</font>

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, if she hadn't been spacing out all the time, nobody would ever catch her!</font>

251
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

252
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

253
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care of Sanji!</font>

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?!</font>

255
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A huge anchor?</font>

256
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's way too huge!</font>

257
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aim for the Straw Hat crew's ship.</font>

258
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hit it head-on and sink it!</font>

259
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some of'em are Devil Fruit users!
If we get'em into the water, they're ours!</font>

260
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad! Just one hit from that and we'll sink!</font>

261
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dodge it! Use the Burst or the Paddle! Can we make it?</font>

262
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's too late!</font>

263
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and come with me, Usopp!</font>

264
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

265
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yeah!</font>

266
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get on the bow!</font>

267
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

268
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, right!</font>

269
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna use our secret weapon!</font>

270
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Secret weapon?</font>

271
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Drop it!</font>

272
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny's in trouble!</font>

273
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing is dangerous!</font>

274
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Believe in this ship!</font>

275
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mane started spinning!</font>

276
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sink!</font>

277
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's falling right at us!</font>

278
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Emergency Evasion...</font>

279
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Secret Weapon!</font>

280
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chicken Voyage!</font>

281
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They dodged it!</font>

282
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

283
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never heard of any ship that can go backwards!</font>

284
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

285
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get inside the prow!</font>

286
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The prow?</font>

287
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woah! You can enter it!</font>

288
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think dodging it was all we could do!</font>

289
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship has got way more power than that!</font>

290
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

291
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it now?!</font>

292
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Charging complete!</font>

293
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

294
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do now?</font>

295
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get as many as you can inside the circle!</font>

296
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Circle?</font>

297
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like this?</font>

298
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're in!</font>

299
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lock on with the button on the handle, then pull the lever!</font>

300
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This and...</font>

301
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This?</font>

302
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

303
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Gaon: Lion's roar</i></font>

304
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gaon Cannon!</font>

305
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

306
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

307
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too impressed!</font>

308
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you see that?!</font>

309
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sunny's full power?</font>

310
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That move took out almost all the Flying Fish!</font>

311
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just how good Usopp is!</font>

312
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a first try it was magnificent!</font>

313
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow!!! What an amazing destructive power!</font>

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sunny!</font>

315
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lion-chan is incredible! It seemed as if my eyes were going to pop out!</font>

316
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though I have no eyes to pop out...</font>

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It uses three barrels of cola to prevent the ship from being blown away...</font>

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And at the same time, it releases two barrels worth of Coup de Burst from the cannon.</font>

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It uses a ton of cola, so don't you overuse it!</font>

320
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's tied us up with the net!</font>

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

322
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That speedy mermaid!</font>

323
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're almost there, Sanji-chin...</font>

324
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

325
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

326
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness!</font>

327
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is Sanji all right?</font>

328
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, it's terrible!</font>

329
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-chin is losing a lot of blood!</font>

330
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

331
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he get done in?!</font>

332
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when I thought I'd saved him, a lot of blood suddenly started flowing out of his nose!</font>

333
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nosebleed?</font>

334
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine...</font>

335
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he dies like that, then let him die.</font>

336
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's true...</font>

337
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At least he seems happy.</font>

338
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Sanji-chin!</font>

339
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this...</font>

340
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heaven?</font>

341
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn...</font>

342
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He survived, huh?!</font>

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it looks like your subordinates are useless now, doesn't it?</font>

344
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

345
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, I guess you should learn how terrifying Motobaro is!</font>

346
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lost count of how many fools have been impaled by his giant horns to this day!</font>

347
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say his horns have even managed to destroy village dams...</font>

348
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put him in a cage, and he'll break straight out!</font>

349
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only reason I've been able to escape from the Navy all this time...</font>

350
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is because of this guy's horns!</font>

351
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They call them the "Heart-smashing horns"!</font>

352
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right.</font>

353
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stop you!</font>

354
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Motobaro!</font>

355
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out, Luffy!</font>

356
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The horns were completely useless!</font>

357
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in us fighting!</font>

358
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong, Motobaro?</font>

359
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The cow's acting strangely, isn't it?</font>

360
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

361
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He lost consciousness?</font>

362
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What just happened?</font>

363
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do?</font>

365
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't do anything!</font>

366
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Motobaro!</font>

367
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, how can this be?!</font>

368
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't seem like he attacked it...</font>

369
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like Luffy won the cow over by talking to it...</font>

370
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

371
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean, he psyched it out?</font>

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that huge thing just fainted!</font>

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that even possible?</font>

374
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you... Damn Straw Hat kid...!</font>

375
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a minute, Luffy!</font>

376
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

377
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you're alright!</font>

378
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll end this stupid incident filled with pointless accusations myself!</font>

379
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finish it?</font>

380
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg!</font>

381
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as you keep on living as a pirate I'll never find peace!</font>

382
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who's sick of the accusations!</font>

383
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

384
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to see that stupid poster-face any more than you do.</font>

385
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It shouldn't even exist in real life!</font>

386
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, then...</font>

387
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should just die!</font>

388
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oeil</font>
