77
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think about it.</font>

78
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What difference does it make if one person from that village preaches that fishmen are good people?</font>

79
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be just like Otohime's preaching.
Her words will go in one ear and out the other.</font>

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am Rear Admiral Strawberry, from Navy HQ.</font>

81
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,700

82
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The adults in the village you just visited were informed that there might be a small commotion out here.</font>

83
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They accepted it...</font>

84
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so that we would let that girl stay
even though she belongs to the Celestial Dragons.</font>

85
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain of the Sun Pirates, Fisher Tiger!</font>

86
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are guilty of two crimes.</font>

87
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that you know what they are.</font>

88
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Raiding and desertion.  </font>

89
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were those gunshots?</font>

90
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They came from where the Boss went!</font>

91
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,570

92
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,230

93
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,260

94
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,220

96
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,370

97
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,620

100
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,600

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong!</font>

102
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

103
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll let you handle this!  We'll go and help the Boss!</font>

104
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, Brother Jinbe!</font>

105
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd better bring Big Brother back safe,
or I won't go easy on you!</font>

106
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course I will!  Let's go!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san, it's hopeless!  The ship won't hold!</font>

109
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Abandon ship!</font>

110
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to steal one of the Navy boats!</font>

111
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with his endurance?!</font>

112
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why won't he go down
even after getting shot so many times?!</font>

113
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unforgivable.</font>

114
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unforgivable!</font>

115
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never forgive you for this, humans!</font>

116
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire.</font>

117
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you hear something, Mommy?</font>

118
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

119
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss...</font>

120
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

121
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rear Admiral!  The Sun Pirates are here!</font>

122
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's him?  The infamous...</font>

123
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe?</font>

124
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys... forgive me.</font>

125
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Boss!</i></font>

126
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're the one responsible?!</font>

127
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is for the sake of justice.
For the eradication of the Sun Pirates!</font>

128
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damned Navy!</font>

129
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take your head as well!</font>

130
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead, if you can!</font>

131
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,720

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You refuse to accept a blood transfusion?!  Boss, what are you saying?!</font>

135
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've lost too much blood!
If you don't get a transfusion soon, you'll...</font>

136
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have a rare blood type!
No one in the crew is a match!</font>

139
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  We have the same kind of blood as the humans!</font>

140
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can use human blood!  You can still be saved!</font>

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's filthy blood!</font>

145
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The blood that has continued to scorn us fishmen!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Brother!  What happened
between you and the humans?!</font>

150
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't want... to tell you.</font>

151
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,300

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah.  A lot of things happened.</i></font>

157
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was imprisoned!</font>

158
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I spent several years in Mariejoa.</font>

159
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was...</font>

160
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a slave!</font>

161
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

162
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss...</font>

163
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What I saw there was the madness of humankind.</font>

164
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I managed to escape with my life intact...</font>

165
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I couldn't just ignore
all the other slaves I had seen.</font>

166
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen closely.</font>

167
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lived my life as I pleased...</font>

168
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and as a result...
I've severely hindered Queen Otohime's efforts.</font>

169
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she... is right.</font>

170
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone can see that peace would be for the best!</font>

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... the only ones who can truly change our island...</font>

172
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are those like Koala.
The next generation, who don't know anything.</font>

173
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, I beg of you!</font>

174
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell the people on our island anything!</font>

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:59,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And yet those of us who die only leave hatred in the world... Isn't that absurd?!</font>

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're Arlong?</font>

210
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you come back?</font>

211
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So recklessly...  </font>

212
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">coming back to this place.</font>

213
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came to slaughter the humans who shot Big Brother Ti!</font>

214
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to go to the island that sold us out too!</font>

215
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is your retaliation?</font>

216
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  Fisher Tiger died!</font>

217
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You inferior scumbags killed him!</font>

218
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, really?  So he's dead?</font>

219
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Either way, you'll be coming with me.</font>

220
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger's death outraged Arlong,</font>

221
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so he bared his fangs toward the humans he resented...</font>

222
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and was captured.</font>

223
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the transfusion hadn't been refused, he could have survived!</font>

224
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we'd had access to fishman blood, Fisher Tiger wouldn't have died!</font>

225
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You humans drove him to his death!</font>

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:53,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"After being refused a blood transfusion by humans,
Fisher Tiger, captain of the Sun Pirates, died."</font>

227
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not too far from the truth.</font>

228
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the humans' fault that he died, after all.</font>

229
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong lied to the Navy.</font>

230
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth was much more cruel.</font>

231
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Resenting the humans that betrayed him,
the hero Tiger refused to have their blood in his veins.</font>

232
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not to mention his past as a slave.</font>

233
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the world found out about that, it would damage the Boss's honor.</font>

234
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong would never reveal that.</font>

235
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyuu- Captain Jinbe!</font>

236
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enemy ship sighted!</font>

237
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if the Boss is gone, we cannot turn back now!</font>

238
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare for battle!  But remember, don't kill anyone!</font>

239
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

240
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I became known as Sea Knight Jinbe,</font>

241
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">captain of the Sun Pirates.</font>

242
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I devoted myself to never-ending battle.</font>

243
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I am writing this to you...</font>

247
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Tiger was forced to choose the path he took -jamon.</font>

248
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I understand the scream I heard from his heart that day.</font>

249
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be alright.  I will not lose!</font>

250
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must live beneath the sun!</font>

251
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The day when we and the humans understand each other will definitely come!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sign this form!  Declare your wish to emigrate, here!</font>

253
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't!  It's impossible, Otohime-sama!</font>

254
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tiger-san saved all the slaves,
he didn't discriminate by race...</font>

255
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but then the humans simply abandoned him!</font>

256
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just how are we supposed to understand one another?!</font>

257
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not a single signature today, either.</font>

258
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mother!</i></font>

259
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,450

261
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?  Are you alright?</font>

262
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's completely worn out.</font>

263
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, my oasis of peace.</font>

264
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am alright!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mother!</i></font>

267
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us make a promise...</font>

268
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for your future.</font>

269
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Day after day, Queen Otohime ran herself ragged.</font>

270
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rescuing the victims of shipwrecks.</font>

271
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

272
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates again?</font>

273
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help us.</font>

274
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we will!</font>

275
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us carry them to the island!</font>

276
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Teaching the children of the island about the surface world.</font>

277
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a forest, the place I told you about yesterday where lots of trees grow together.</font>

278
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forest?  The Sea Forest?</font>

279
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Collecting signatures.</font>

280
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

281
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will only take a second!</font>

282
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

283
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime.</font>

284
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  It's you!</font>

285
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all people who have signed the form, right?</font>

286
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today, we've got a favor to ask.</font>

287
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many signatures have you gathered?</font>

288
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have spent five years collecting these.</font>

289
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are ten signatures on each sheet...</font>

290
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I have about a hundred of them.</font>

291
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So one thousand supporters.</font>

292
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island has five million people
so I was hoping for more, but...</font>

293
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, we have a selfish request to make.</font>

294
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want to withdraw our signatures,
which works out at about fifty of your sheets.</font>

295
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Haven't you heard?
Pirates came to the island the other day.</font>

296
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They plundered the town and fled the island.</font>

297
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama...</font>

298
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama!</font>

299
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, children.  Have you come to hear more stories about the surface world?</font>

300
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... This paper I signed the other day.</font>

301
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mom said to. </font>

302
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mom said to! </i></font>

303
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

304
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did as you asked because you're the queen, but...</font>

305
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The humans are the problem.</font>

306
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've had enough...</font>

307
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">of your speeches, too.</font>

308
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm tired of them.</font>

309
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome home, Mother!</font>

310
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gave it my all today as well!</font>

311
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm home, my little angels!</font>

312
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I went a little overboard,
so can you leave me alone just for today?</font>

313
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Liars!  Every single one of you!</i></font>

314
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Otohime-sama!</font>

315
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're broadcasting to the whole country!</font>

316
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shaddup... ya damn Ministah of da Left!</font>

317
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... Have you been drinking?!</font>

318
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shaddup.  Ah ain't... Ah ain't drunk!</font>

319
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, you are!</font>

320
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

321
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime's voice?</font>

322
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up, y'all!</font>

323
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We... We can live anywhere in the ocean.</font>

324
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In this vast, vast ocean.</font>

325
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the dark, dark ocean floor.</font>

326
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do we all live in this one place?  </font>

327
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime-sama...</font>

328
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:29,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it because there's a tiny bit of light and air here?</font>

329
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the surface, the whole world is bathed in sunlight!</font>

330
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a vast sky above.</font>

331
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:51,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do children sneak out to look at Sabaody Park?</font>

332
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Out there in the world...</font>

333
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there are so many wonderful places!</font>

334
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should be able to go to all of those places.</font>

335
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't we just making up empty excuses,
and convincing ourselves that we should give up?!</font>

336
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be brave...</font>

337
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and strive for the thing we all want the most!</font>

338
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty.</font>

339
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the humans are an obstacle standing in our way...</font>

340
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then let's overcome that obstacle together!</font>

341
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we do, then maybe
the children living on Fishman Island today...</font>

342
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can change their future.</font>

343
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At least a little bit!</font>

344
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have your wounds healed?</font>

345
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ran into some serious trouble.</font>

346
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought you'd get beaten this badly.</font>

347
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong, who was imprisoned
in Impel Down the other day, was nothing.</font>

348
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truly fierce one is Jinbe.</font>

349
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't see that kind of strength every day.</font>

350
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's far too dangerous to let him roam free.</font>

351
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Unclear Justice</i></font>

352
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea?  Me?!</font>

353
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your bounty's 250 million beli!</font>

354
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Government must have realized that you'll become a huge threat to them if they don't do this!</font>

355
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they're beginning to learn their lesson!</font>

356
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just turn down their offer
and become even more notorious,</font>

357
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Jinbe -chuu!</font>

358
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I plan to accept their offer.</font>

359
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh?!</i></font>

360
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard about the offer to join the Warlords.</font>

361
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I join the Seven Warlords,
the Government will pardon my crew.</font>

362
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aladdin and others who want to quit being pirates
will be able to live in this country in peace.</font>

363
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:35,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, if I accept this title, maybe fishmen can get a bit closer to joining the World Government.</font>

364
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the sake of Her Majesty,
after I've caused her so much trouble.</font>

365
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, and I'm grateful.</font>

366
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though she's in a pretty bad way right now.</font>

367
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the late Tiger's wish.</font>

368
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe this is a step toward
the liberation and freedom of fishmen! </font>

369
00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, there is
one worrisome detail regarding the pardon...</font>

370
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san!</font>

371
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong!</font>

372
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san has returned!  He's back!</font>

373
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there's something you want to say,
then spit it out, Arlong!</font>

374
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea,
eh, Brother Jinbe?</font>

375
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words,
you're becoming a dog of the human Government!</font>

376
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten Brother Ti's words?!</font>

377
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop letting grudges and hatred control your life!</font>

378
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gotten soft, Brother.</font>

379
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that becoming your underling would be the safest option for me,</font>

380
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I'm not gonna do that!</font>

381
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Brother died!</font>

382
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be reforming my old Arlong Crew.</font>

383
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I'll be taking my brethren with me.</font>

384
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is farewell.</font>

385
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong, you...</font>

386
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to stop me that bad...</font>

387
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then this is your chance.</font>

388
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just kill me!</font>

389
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Arlong-san!</font>

390
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can't, then that means I'm free!</font>

391
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the fury of fishmankind!</font>

392
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enough of your insolence!  </font>

393
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san!</font>

394
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine by me!</font>

395
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san!</font>

396
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop this!</i></font>

397
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let it get to you, Jinbe.</font>

398
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You grew up in the Fishman District together.
You're like brothers.</font>

399
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what happens,
you wouldn't be able to kill him.</font>

400
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can't that fool understand...</font>

401
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother Ti's real intentions?!</font>

402
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter where he goes.
If he gets too violent, the Navy will take action.</font>

403
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if they don't, and he does get out of control,
we'll go stop him ourselves.</font>

404
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For certain.</font>

405
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:49,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sheesh!  We're also going back to
doing our own thing, Captain Jinbe.</font>

406
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Macro, you...</font>

407
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let him do whatever he wants.</font>

408
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So long!</font>

409
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, that freakishly strong bastard!</font>

410
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi, let's go.</font>

411
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Sun Pirates...</font>

412
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">split into three groups,</font>

413
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and everybody went their own way.</font>

414
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship drifts to Fishman Island, carrying a shipwrecked Celestial Dragon,</font>

415
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who see fishmen as mere slaves.</font>

416
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Otohime decides to follow this Celestial Dragon up to the surface.</font>

417
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After her return, her dream is soon to be realized,</font>

418
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">only to be shattered by a single gunshot.</font>

419
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next time, on One Pace:</font>
