00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill all the... fishmen...</font>

137
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who have lost their pride!</font>

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He did it!</i></font>

140
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, he really...</font>

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">beat Hody!</font>

142
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're done for!  Both us, and the island!</font>

143
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out of here!</font>

144
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zeo-san!  Give us a break!</font>

145
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The island's...</font>

146
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be fooled!</font>

147
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were chosen by the heavens.</font>

148
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hody and his crew...</font>

149
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">could never be defeated by mere humans!</font>

150
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But if the Noah crushes the island, we'll all...</font>

151
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death still counts as revenge.</font>

152
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our deaths will feed the hatred of humans in others!</font>

153
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This tragedy will become our flesh and blood.</font>

154
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our malice will live on.</font>

155
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be passed on to the next generation,
and we will surely have our revenge!</font>

156
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is.</font>

157
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hody and the commanders are all insane!</font>

158
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the humans who made us like this!</font>

159
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not retreat!</font>

160
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Direct all your rage toward the humans -bogon!</font>

161
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The calamity that is hanging over all of fishmankind...</font>

162
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is entirely the humans' fault -zugan!</font>

163
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are the humans really... that scary?</font>

164
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

165
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, historically speaking, the humans have-</font>

166
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop.</font>

167
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly.</font>

168
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look for yourselves.</font>

169
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, in the plaza and in the sky above,</font>

170
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the ones fighting against the pirates from the Fishman District...</font>

171
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are humans.</font>

172
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are all those guys... really human?</font>

173
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, some of them look pretty strange.</font>

174
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But still, we must see this for ourselves.</font>

175
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no right to say anything if we don't.</font>

176
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever happens now...</font>

177
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you must watch with an open mind!</font>

178
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone who isn't willing to die in battle...</font>

179
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can die by my hands,
and live on in the grudge against the humans!</font>

180
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop this!  They are your allies!</font>

181
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm saved!  Thank you, Skeleton Mask!</font>

182
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You again?</font>

183
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure talk about death a lot
for someone who has never died!</font>

184
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die and live on in a grudge?!  Preposterous!</font>

185
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing remains after death!</font>

186
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When a creature dies,
there's nothing left but dead bones!</font>

187
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really convincing!</font>

188
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very kind of you!</font>

189
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really hate people who throw their lives away!</font>

190
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It makes me sick to my stomach.</font>

191
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I have no stomach to be sick!</font>

192
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you the ones who are throwing your lives away?</font>

193
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you staying here
without even trying to run away...</font>

194
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">when you humans are the ones
who will undoubtedly die once the Noah crashes!</font>

195
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granted, I'm not sure you're really human!</font>

196
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our Captain Luffy is going to be
the Pirate King someday.</font>

197
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that captain just said...</font>

198
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that he won't let anyone harm Fishman Island!</font>

199
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That we could leave it all to him!</font>

200
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as we believe in him, why would we worry about anything?</font>

201
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, it's time for me to fulfill my own mission!</font>

202
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't take my eyes off you again!</font>

203
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I have no eyes!</font>

204
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's dis?!</font>

205
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surprised?!</font>

206
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's more than enough.  Oh, I am so surprised.</font>

207
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

208
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright... Let's end this, Jinbe.</font>

209
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, it's time!</font>

210
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait... I lost my swords.</font>

211
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How am I supposed to fight?</font>

212
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell if I know.</font>

213
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so impudent!</font>

214
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna settle this in one hit,
with the debut of my new super move!</font>

215
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One finger... Two fingers...</font>

216
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I raise the third finger,
I will snipe you and this fight will be over!</font>

217
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of foolish fantasy are you living?!</font>

218
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wake up from your stupid daydream, you puny bastard!</font>

219
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't admit your defeat?!</font>

220
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's funny... I'm actually surprised too.</font>

221
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used to spout lies all the time...</font>

222
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but now I can <i>do</i> the stuff I boast about!</font>

223
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that monster?!</font>

224
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did that thing come from?!</font>

225
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That's...</font>

226
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper?!</font>

227
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That little runt... grew huge all of a sudden!</font>

228
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Hey, hey!</font>

229
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was no need for you to go berserk!</font>

230
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright, Usopp!</font>

231
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!  What do you mean, it's alright?!</font>

232
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm now able to fight in this form for three minutes,
using the Rumble Ball!</font>

233
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It isn't like it was before!</font>

234
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't cause you guys any more trouble!</font>

235
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it!
You're not going berserk, you're helping us out!</font>

236
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dependable you've become!</font>

237
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-</font>

238
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Saying that won't make me happy, you jerk!</font>

239
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just scary!</font>

240
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta be kidding me -dosun!</font>

241
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter how big you become, I'm still gonna blast you to the ends of the sea -gogyan!</font>

242
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't be able to blast me anywhere!</font>

243
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, bring it!</font>

244
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

245
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chatting with your friends during a fight?!
Know your place!</font>

246
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're nothing but a hindrance to your crew!</font>

247
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna finish you off right now!</font>

248
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't I tell you that I've got a trick up my sleeve?</font>

249
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, bring it on!  I'll show you my magic tricks!</font>

250
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Interesting!  You say
you're gonna finish me off in one hit?</font>

251
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if the Dried Squid Spear doesn't work on you,</font>

252
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been concealing a powerful spear that can penetrate anything!</font>

253
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Light up!</font>

254
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Mortar Bon Spear</i></font>

255
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who'll be dropped with a single hit -hi!</font>

256
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll pierce a hole right through the robot into the driver's seat -hi!</font>

257
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is rather cool, but...</font>

258
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it's no use.</font>

259
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Against my ultimate weapon, you are...</font>

260
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just an inferior squid!</font>

261
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't fight bare handed.  What should I do?</font>

262
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't cut someone down who has no will to fight.</font>

263
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get lost, damn frog.</font>

264
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Frog?</font>

265
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yer gonna end dis?  Dat's mah line!</font>

266
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,650
