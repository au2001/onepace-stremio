35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you want to know how he proposed to me?</font>

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! It was perfect!</font>

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When he pulled off the face pack,
he looked terrible.</font>

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I was waiting for that exact moment.</font>

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By showing tears right there,</font>

40
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won his heart.</font>

43
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then that idiot pulled me
into his arms right then and there,</font>

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and said in a quiet whisper,</font>

50
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,790

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's such a pathetic proposal,
don't you think?!</font>

52
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it was so funny!</font>

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who in the world would marry a failure like him?!</font>

54
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Couldn't it at least have been a proper prince?</font>

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think it is.</font>

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think nobody's gonna die?</font>

127
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe <i>all</i> of you will die!</font>

128
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of fool draws up plans
with the expectation of death, young lady?</font>

129
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,180
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Mirro-world</font></font></font>

130
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,180
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Mirro-world</font></font>

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">St... St... Stop!</font>

132
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! Tickle, tickle, tickle!</font>

133
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell us already!</font>

134
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carrot's special tickle, tickle, tickle!</font>

135
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

136
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop tickling me!</font>

137
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just say it! If you don't,
she'll tickle you forever!</font>

138
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll say it! I'll say it!</font>

139
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, Carrot, stop.</font>

140
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

141
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make you pay for this!</font>

142
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer our question.
Which mirror leads to the castle?</font>

143
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't remember every single mirror!</font>

144
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not the right answer!</font>

145
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to ask the mirrors!</font>

146
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? The mirrors?</font>

147
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Ask?</font>

148
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! The mirrors all know what they're reflecting!</font>

149
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

150
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mirror, mirror!</font>

151
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one of you is a mirror to the castle?!</font>

152
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am!</font>

153
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me!</font>

154
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me.</font>

155
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Me too.</font>

156
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They answered!</font>

157
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here! Me too!</font>

158
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Me too!</font>

159
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too!</font>

160
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the mirror in Mistress Galette's closet.</font>

161
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a hand mirror in a guest room
on the second floor.</font>

162
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a mirror in the ladies' room
on the fourth floor.</font>

163
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do any of you currently reflect
Luffy, Nami, Brook, Pedro, or Sanji?</font>

164
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're looking for them!</font>

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who?</font>

166
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do they look like?</font>

167
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Sanji passed by earlier.</font>

168
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah. They don't know
what they look like.</font>

169
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Count on me, Chobro!
I'm good at drawing!</font>

170
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Drawing?</font>

171
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh!</font>

172
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so unfortunate to have
such a dumb brother.</font>

173
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you really are!</font>

174
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we leave her like this,
she'll be dead before the morning.</font>

175
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't let that happen.
That'll ruin our whole plan.</font>

176
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need her to live until tomorrow.</font>

177
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, Big Sister.</font>

178
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll give us trouble if you die like this.</font>

179
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it'll give us trouble
if you reveal my ungraceful nature,</font>

180
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as you've just seen.</font>

181
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you...?</font>

182
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay calm. It won't take long.</font>

183
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the power of the Memo-Memo Fruit.</font>

184
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone has a roll of film in their head
that records memories.</font>

185
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have scary experiences, sad memories,</font>

186
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and things that you want to forget, don't you?</font>

187
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm impressed with Germa 66.</font>

188
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were shot in the leg,
but you still made it that far.</font>

189
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're uselessly tough!</font>

190
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's right!</font>

191
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, I'll paste a memory strip</font>

192
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">from one of the soldiers who was shot
by a stray bullet here and...</font>

193
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Edit!</font>

194
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All done!</font>

195
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your most recent memories
involving me have been cut.</font>

196
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's have a joyous wedding tomorrow.</font>

197
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Call the soldiers to escort her
to the medical room.</font>

198
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

199
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,210
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Prisoner Library</font></font></font>

200
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,210
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Prisoner Library</font></font>

201
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! No!</font>

202
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, stop it, Luffy!
You're scaring me! That's enough!</font>

203
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it!
Your arms really will be torn apart!</font>

204
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care!
I gotta tell Sanji about Pudding!</font>

205
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That rat!</font>

206
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I said don't do it! Luffy!</font>

207
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow... A little more to go!</font>

208
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so reckless.
Hey, girl.</font>

209
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! I'm busy now!</font>

210
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama ordered me to get Lola's whereabouts
out of you during the night.</font>

211
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So just tell me now.</font>

212
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I'm not going to sell out my friend!</font>

213
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, then. I'm gonna torture you.</font>

214
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Don't say that so casually!</font>

215
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'm gonna shoot you with a crossbow
once every five seconds,</font>

216
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so just tell me whenever you're ready.</font>

217
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? What do you mean?</font>

218
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do that... It'll kill me!</font>

219
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then just tell me.</font>

220
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Screw you, wart head!
I won't let you do that!</font>

221
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna be okay, Nami!
I'll rip my arms off in the next five seconds!</font>

222
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

223
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! I don't want either of those to happen!</font>

224
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be a baby!</font>

225
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Is anybody here?!</font>

226
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Whoa! Whoa! I thought you weren't
allowed to enter the castle now!</font>

227
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so hardheaded.
There is chaos all over this castle.</font>

228
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to do this, Opera...</font>

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five Thousand Tile...</font>

230
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">What?!</font>

231
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fist!</font>

232
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry. Why don't you sleep for a while?</font>

233
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe!</font>

234
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Luffy! Nami!</font>

235
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here?!</font>

236
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard you got caught.
I'm glad that you're okay.</font>

237
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can talk later.</font>

238
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But first, don't you want to get out of there?</font>

239
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We do!</font>

240
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,590
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Whole Cake Chateau</font></font></font>

241
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,590
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Whole Cake Chateau</font></font>

242
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,880
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60"><font color="#000000">Medical Room</font></font></font>

243
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,880
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="60">Medical Room</font></font>

244
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was bleeding badly,
but the wound has already started healing.</font>

245
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What incredibly resilient and regenerative skin.</font>

246
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the true power of Germa's modified humans.</font>

247
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she stays in bed for the night, she should be able to attend the tea party tomorrow.</font>

248
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guard her for the rest of the night.</font>

249
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget to tell the Vinsmokes about this.</font>

250
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure they're worried about her.</font>

251
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir.</font>

252
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I'll be in the medical office
on the fourth floor.</font>

253
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time to sleep with the amount
of wounded people that are in the castle right now.</font>

254
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for your service. Take care.</font>

255
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?</font>

256
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

257
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hurt my leg...</font>

258
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you remember how that happened?</font>

259
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was walking around the castle,</font>

260
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and then I ran across soldiers
who were going after intruders...</font>

261
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I got attacked, I suppose?</font>

262
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That doesn't make sense, does it?
Of course not.</font>

263
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your memories were replaced.</font>

264
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

265
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you what really happened.</font>

266
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,290
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="50"><font color="#000000">Prisoner Library</font></font></font>

268
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,720

269
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you gonna burn the cage?
Is that a good idea?</font>

270
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, but only if you two can get out of there before burning up.</font>

271
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright. Do it!</font>

272
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">That quick?!</font>

273
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'm still not ready!</font>

274
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're really gonna burn!</font>

275
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Burn it up already!</font>

276
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

277
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch!</font>

278
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up! Luffy! Nami!</font>

279
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got out!</font>

280
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel like I've been through
something like this before...</font>

281
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, both of you.</font>

282
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to you,
I didn't have to rip my arms apart!</font>

283
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, we met each other...</font>

284
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in a prison like this.</font>

285
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! These people were all inside that book.</font>

286
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The imagination and span
of the World of Books is infinite.</font>

287
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom has many powerful followers
just like Mont d'Or.</font>

288
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Jinbe!
But why are you here?</font>

289
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My Sun Pirates are also
affiliated with Big Mom.</font>

290
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

291
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but...</font>

292
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that means this is...</font>

293
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, this is a rebellion.
There's no turning back now!</font>

294
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Is that okay?</font>

295
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On Fishman Island,
you said that you had other obligations.</font>

296
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just took care of them.</font>

297
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone heard screams
from the Prisoner Library!</font>

298
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">{\an8}What's going on?!</font>

299
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ugh, they've already noticed!</font>

300
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're indeed quick.</font>

301
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, we have to hide
in a place where they can't find us.</font>

302
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">– Yeah.
– Let's go, then!</font>

303
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of a sudden... I feel hungry.</font>

304
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're hungry at a time like this?</font>

305
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy expends three times the energy
of a normal person when he does something.</font>

306
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's okay. I'm not saying
that I wanna eat something.</font>

307
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your stomach is growling.</font>

308
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind!</font>

309
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I won't eat anything
other than what you cook!{Flashback to WCI 11 @timestamp 25:26}</i></font>

310
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even if I get hungry
or spears rain down on me,</i></font>

311
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll stay right here and wait for you!</i></font>

312
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, Jinbe, thank you!</font>

313
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I actually...</i></font>

314
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>was proposed to by Sanji-<i>san</i>.</i></font>

315
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm not going to marry him, because...</i></font>

316
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>he's an idiot that played right into my hands by falling for me...</i></font>

317
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and because he's going to be shot in the middle of the ceremony...</i></font>

318
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>by me.</i></font>

319
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things can't get any worse!</font>

320
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were all fooled! Sanji too!
I gotta let him know!</font>

321
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care of Nami, Jinbe!</font>

322
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, wait!
There are tons of tough enemies in the castle!</font>

323
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're not fully recovered!
Don't you remember what happened this morning?!</font>

324
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not gonna be defeated this time!</font>

325
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,890
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45"><font color="#000000">Medical Room</font></font></font>

326
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,890
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="45">Medical Room</font></font>

327
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you believe me?</font>

328
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, I do.
I know you wouldn't lie to me.</font>

329
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I didn't realize
Pudding's true character was this heinous.</font>

330
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wasn't completely sure.</font>

331
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I thought she seemed a little<i> too</i> perfect,</font>

332
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I was spying on her myself.</font>

333
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she wasn't planning to marry me from the start,
and if the plan was to kill us all along,</font>

334
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then the promise I was given that Luffy and the others would be safe...</font>

335
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was just a big lie!</font>

336
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I could sacrifice myself,
and everything would be fine!</font>

337
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that was nothing but false hope!
How could I have been so naive?</font>

338
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our father may be smart,
but even he was careless in this situation.</font>

339
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's dealing with an emperor.
He should've been more careful.</font>

340
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is a good situation, in my opinion.</font>

341
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe that Germa should be destroyed.</font>

342
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll just pretend I know nothing,</font>

343
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and let Big Mom's plan be carried out...</font>

344
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?
If you go to the tea party, they'll kill you too, Reiju!</font>

345
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, are you worried about me?</font>

346
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the problem with old memories.</font>

347
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't need to think that you're indebted
to me for helping you that one time.</font>

348
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave this island with the Straw Hats, Sanji.</font>

349
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! I can't do that!
If I do that, what will happen to the Baratie?</font>

350
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can worry about that after you've escaped.</font>

351
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you stay here, everybody will die.</font>

352
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, you can't die.
For our mother's sake!</font>

353
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

354
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a memory that I will never forget.</font>

355
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

356
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother and Father had a big fight.</font>

357
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It happened when I was a child.</font>

358
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always wondered why
our sweet mother was so angry.</font>

359
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it made sense much later.</font>

360
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When our mother was pregnant with you four,</font>

361
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she was strongly against turning you
into emotionless machines.</font>

362
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>– Are you serious?!
– Of course I am!</i></font>

363
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How can you want to do such a horrible thing?</i></font>

364
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The operating room is ready.</i></font>

365
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't do this! They're <i>my</i> children, too!</i></font>

366
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you get rid of their emotions, they won't be human anymore!</i></font>

367
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I want them to be monsters.
Winning wars is all that matters.</i></font>

368
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The reestablishment of the Vinsmoke family
that once conquered the North Blue.</i></font>

369
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Accomplishing that goal... requires strength.</i></font>

370
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll give my children the greatest power possible!</i></font>

371
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>– No!
– Take her!</i></font>

372
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are you...? No! Let go of me!</i></font>

373
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Dear! Don't do it!
They're my children!</i></font>

374
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No!</i></font>

375
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then they performed the surgery.</font>

376
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:28,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But our mother took a powerful drug
to try and foil our father's plan.</font>

377
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, what have you done, Sora?</i></font>

378
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This drug was strong enough to affect

379
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But her actions weren't enough.</i></font>

380
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They soon found superhuman abnormalities
