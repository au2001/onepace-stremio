106
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks to this incident,
I've finally decided upon something.</font>

107
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Usopp! What did you
want to talk to us about?!</font>

108
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You guys fought well against
those Black Cat Pirates!</font>

109
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As captain, I feel very proud!</font>

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You were scared to death,
but you managed to keep Kaya safe!</font>

111
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We overcame our biggest
and greatest battle since we formed</font>

112
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the Usopp Pirates five years ago,
when you guys were just four!</font>

113
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Yes!
– Yes!</font>

114
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So, I know this is sudden, but I've
decided to set out to sea by myself!</font>

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna be a real pirate!</font>

116
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I had always been unsure if I wanted
to stay here forever or not...</font>

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But, once I saw them,
I finally made up my mind!</font>

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I feel that as a man, I must
set out onto the vast ocean!</font>

119
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So I'm leaving this village!</font>

120
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There's but one reason:
The pirate flag is calling me!</font>

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain! You're lying, right?!</font>

122
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're lying again, right?!</font>

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's way too hasty to do that!
Don't you love this village, Captain?!</font>

124
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What'll happen to the Usopp Pirates?!</font>

125
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've been great to me, guys...</font>

126
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I plan to leave without
telling the villagers.</font>

127
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Give them my regards.</font>

128
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No...</font>

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't want to!</font>

130
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't go, Captain!</font>

131
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you remember this place?</font>

132
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is where we first met.</font>

133
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>All done!</i></font>

134
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Liar guy!</i></font>

135
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Who're you guys?!
Don't treat me all buddy-like!</i></font>

136
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>But you're famous!</i></font>

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Yeah, you're a famous person...</i></font>

138
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I see!</i></font>

139
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>So, people have finally started to
respectfully call me Captain Usopp!</i></font>

140
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Everyone calls you Liar Usopp!</i></font>

141
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Alright! From this day forth,
you're members of the Usopp Pirates!</i></font>

142
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>– What?
– What?</i></font>

143
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Don't give me that!</i></font>

144
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A lot's happened, huh?</font>

145
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>A cerberus! Scare it away!</i></font>

146
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>A dragon! Capture it!</i></font>

147
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Flour Star!</i></font>

148
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You're amazing, Captain!</i></font>

149
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>But of course! I am
a brave warrior of the sea!</i></font>

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We don't wanna hear
about the old days!</font>

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! We don't wanna hear about that!</font>

152
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This isn't like you, Captain!
Why are you saying this stuff now?!</font>

153
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's almost like you're...</font>

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're so stupid, Captain! Stupid!</font>

155
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are your ambitions in life?!</font>

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To run a pub!</font>

157
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To be a master carpenter!</font>

158
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To be a novel writer!</font>

159
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then swear here that you'll
continue on each of your paths</font>

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and never let the fires
of your ambitions go out!</font>

161
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As of today...</font>

162
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the Usopp Pirates...</font>

163
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">are disbanded!</font>

164
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well, we've eaten.
We should get going now.</font>

165
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah...</font>

166
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here you are!</font>

167
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey, Miss!</font>

168
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are you alright, being out of bed?</font>

169
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes...</font>

170
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My sickness this past year</font>

171
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">was caused by the mental dismay
from having lost my parents...</font>

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And Usopp really
cheered me up, too...</font>

173
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't stay coddled forever!</font>

174
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You've done so much
for me. Thank you.</font>

175
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've prepared a present for you
from the bottom of my heart!</font>

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please accept it!</font>

177
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All packed...</font>

178
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Guess it's farewell to this house, too!</font>

179
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What the...? I can't get out!</font>

181
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Darn it!</font>

182
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A caravel!</font>

183
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can we really have this?!</font>

184
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, please use it!</font>

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's a slightly older model,
but I personally designed it!</font>

186
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A carvel-make caravel, with lateen sails
and a central stern rudder...</font>

187
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">the <i>Going Merry</i>!</font>

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let me explain the running rigging!</font>

189
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">First, about the Kruger
net yard adjustment–</font>

190
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, no! You can explain
the ship stuff to me!</font>

191
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a good ship!</font>

192
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Especially this front—it's so cool!</font>

193
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We've loaded it with everything
you might need on a voyage.</font>

194
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks! It leaves nothing to beat tired!</font>

195
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's, "Leaves nothing
to be desired," you idiot.</font>

196
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop this thing!</font>

197
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

198
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's he doing?</font>

199
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's just stop him for now.
He's on a collision course with the ship.</font>

200
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-Thanks...</font>

201
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sure thing.</font>

202
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So you are taking
to the ocean, Usopp?</font>

203
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah. I've decided to get going
before I start to change my mind.</font>

204
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't stop me now.</font>

205
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I won't. I could just tell somehow.</font>

206
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's kind of sad, too!</font>

207
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The next time I come to this village,</font>

208
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll tell you adventure stories that
seem even more lie-like than lies!</font>

209
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay! I look forward to it!</font>

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You guys take care, too!
Let's meet again sometime!</font>

211
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How come?</font>

212
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh? How come?
Man, you're antisocial...</font>

213
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna be a pirate too, so we'll
meet on the high seas eventually!</font>

214
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What're you talking about?
Get on board already.</font>

215
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?</font>

216
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're one of us now, aren't you?</font>

217
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I...</font>

218
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I get to be captain, right?!</font>

219
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't be dumb! I'm the captain!</font>

220
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There goes the captain...</font>

221
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah. But he's with those guys,
so I feel less worried now.</font>

222
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah. I've never seen anyone
as strong as them before.</font>

223
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Guess it can't be helped.</font>

224
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He always talked about how
he wanted to be a pirate.</font>

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The villagers will probably be sad
when we tell them, though...</font>

226
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's all so sudden, plus he
livened things up all by himself...</font>

227
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I just had an idea!</font>

228
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– What is it?
– What is it?</font>

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Merry...</font>

230
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes?</font>

231
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Lying hurts...</font>

232
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are you referring to Klahadore?</font>

233
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No...</font>

234
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You mean how you really wanted to stop Usopp from going?</font>

235
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:07,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Miss, the villagers once told me
a story from his childhood.</font>

236
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shortly after Usopp's
father left the village,</font>

237
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">his mother passed away.</font>

238

240
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Dad's pirates are here!</i></font>

241
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6"><i>H-Hold on, Usopp!</i></font>

242
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You mustn't shout!</i></font>

243
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,450

245
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>But he said he'd take us with him
when you get better, Mom!</i></font>

246
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Your father won't be coming back...</i></font>

247
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>But... I'm proud I married him...</i></font>

248
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Th-There's a legendary medicine!
It can cure any sickness!</i></font>

249
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You're so silly...
You dream too much...</i></font>

250
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:13,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I don't care if I'm silly! I do dream!
I am the son of a pirate!</i></font>

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Perhaps out of his loneliness,</font>

254
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">he continued to shout it out
after his mother's death...</font>

255
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">in the hopes that one day his father's
pirate ship would be at the shore...</font>

256
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">in the hopes that one day
he would come back for him.</font>

257
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The villagers say that lie of his
also contains his wish.</font>

258
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>Pirates!</i></font>

259
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">As someone who lost his
own parents in this village,</font>

260
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">he probably couldn't ignore you,
seeing as the same happened to you.</font>

261
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You will need to grow
stronger now, too!</font>

262
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To live up to everything
he's done until today!</font>

263
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes!</font>

264
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">To our new ship and crewmate!</font>

265
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Cheers!
– Cheers!</font>

266
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They said they were
fighting to live, not die.</font>

267
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp's lies always spoke
about the joy of living.</font>

268
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They cheered me up
and told me to live!</font>

269
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Indeed.</font>

270
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here we go!</font>

271
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are we really gonna do this?!</font>

272
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You bet! We're following
in our captain's footsteps!</font>

273
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Pirates are here!
– Pirates are here!</font>

274
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You know what, Merry?
I'm going to be a doctor!</font>

275
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's a wonderful goal to have!</font>
