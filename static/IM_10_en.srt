00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

2
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who</i> are you going to push into the sea?</font>

3
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems you don't know your opponents.</font>

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't hold back! Throw them overboard!</font>

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

6
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Jinbei!</font>

7
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Karate!</font>

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spear Wave!</font>

9
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

10
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, how careless of me.</font>

11
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the ship we're gonna use, isn't it?</font>

12
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Oh no! Run away, Straw Hat!</font>

14
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Champion Stamp!</font>

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no good! My wax won't work against him now!</font>

16
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doru Doru Cancellation!</font>

17
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

18
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Venom Demon!</font>

19
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out of here!</font>

20
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

21
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell's Judgement!</font>

22
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it all!</font>

23
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... Help me!</font>

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take me with you!</font>

25
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot! Don't touch me!</font>

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison is... spreading!</font>

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't matter if it's wax or stone...</font>

28
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison keeps spreading like an infection!</font>

29
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! Now the Doru Doru armor is completely useless!</font>

30
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,410
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down Main Entrance</font>

31
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to Straw-chan and the others?</font>

32
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's it going with the warships?</font>

33
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hear gunfire, but I can't really tell what's happening in that mist!</font>

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure they'll be able to steal one of the warships, but...</font>

35
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, they're pretty far away.</font>

36
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's going to take a while for them to steal one and then bring it back.</font>

37
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't that mean that Magellan might get here first?</font>

38
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy is strong and all but...</font>

39
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I doubt he'll be able to hold Magellan back very long...</font>

40
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan...</font>

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! Please hurry, Jinbei!</font>

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Force them into the sea! Don't let them take the ship!</font>

43
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this guy's body?!</font>

44
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His whole body is made of blades!</font>

45
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Supa Supa Fruit.</font>

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Supa Supa: Sound of slicing</i></font>

47
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just remembered who this guy is!</font>

48
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the West Blue assassin, Daz!</font>

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sables!</font>

50
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only a matter of time before they take the ship!</font>

51
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would be a huge disgrace for the Navy!</font>

52
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sink it, immediately!</font>

53
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

54
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare to attack!</font>

55
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that thing from before!</font>

56
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it, our gunpowder's all wet!</font>

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei, huh?!</font>

58
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Load another battery, and shoot him!</font>

59
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! Hurry! He's right behind us!</font>

60
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Guys, are you there?!</font>

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Straw-chan's voice!</font>

62
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta run!</font>

63
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's some monstrous thing chasing after them!</font>

64
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Magellan! There's nowhere to run!</font>

65
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got a warship yet?!</font>

66
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-chan! We're still waiting for a ship to get on!</font>

67
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

68
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell Wink!</font>

69
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan?!</font>

70
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a surprise!</font>

71
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It... It seems Vi made it in time...</font>

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He hit the back of his head so hard he passed out!</font>

73
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-san! And Inazuma, too! You're alive!</font>

74
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness!</font>

75
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-sama!</font>

76
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those two!</font>

77
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! It's from Jinbei!</font>

78
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Baby Snail Phone!</font>

79
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, you two!</font>

80
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you even come along?</font>

81
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun, so you made it?</font>

82
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here! He's still chasing us, though!</font>

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna hit a dead end at the exit!</font>

84
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me. We've stolen a ship, but we're too far away from you!</font>

85
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't stop moving!</font>

86
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jump straight into the sea!</font>

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get everyone to throw themselves into the ocean!</font>

88
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying, Jinbei?!</font>

89
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in the Calm Belt, you know!</font>

90
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can leave the rest to me!</font>

91
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do what he says!</font>

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-</font>?!

93
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three! Come help me one more time!</font>

94
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you insane?! If we leap into the ocean, we'll die for sure!</font>

95
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He works for the Government! He's not worthy of our trust!</font>

96
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damn Fishman bastard!</font>

97
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's Ace's friend!</font>

98
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I trust him!</font>

99
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the sea? If you think you can, then just try and get away!</font>

100
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The moment you touch the water, you'll be in the Sea Kings' nest!</font>

101
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! Don't let even a drop of his poison touch you!</font>

102
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's impossible!</font>

103
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's over!</font>

104
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell's Judgement!</font>

105
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Third!</font>

106
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a special service!</font>

107
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candle Wall!</font>

108
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pointless!</font>

109
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no...</font>

110
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gigant Stamp!</font>

111
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He pushed him back!</font>

112
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison's still coming toward us!</font>

113
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jumping into the sea is our only hope?!</font>

114
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!</font>

115
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan! Iva-chan, wake up!</font>

116
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in trouble!</font>

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iva-chan! Wake up!</font>

118
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hurry and wake up!</font>

119
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm? What?</font>

120
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta hurry!</font>

121
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are vyou? Straw Hat Boy's son?</font>

122
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use that move of yours!</font>

123
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Wink!</font>

124
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay then.</font>

125
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you can't be serious! If we do that...</font>

126
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here Vi go!</font>

127
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second, Iva-sama!</font>

128
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your plan is pointless!</font>

129
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you enter the sea without a ship, there's no hope for you!</font>

130
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, grab on to his face!</font>

131
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His face?!</font>

132
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let you escape!</font>

133
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell...</font>

134
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wink!</font>

135
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't get away!</font>

136
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're falling!</font>

137
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something under the ships!</font>

138
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

140
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We landed on something!</font>

141
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Look at this!</font>

142
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?!</font>

143
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you made it in time...</font>

144
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry for calling you out to such a dangerous sea!</font>

145
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a school of whale-sharks!</font>

146
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei called them here!</font>

147
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

148
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's amazing!</font>

149
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

150
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it! We've finally reached the warship!</font>

151
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We managed to escape!</font>

152
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like I'm dreaming! I never thought I'd make it out of Impel Down! {here}</font>

153
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time to celebrate yet!</font>

154
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to hurry and get out of here!</font>

155
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it!</font>

156
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, whale-sharks!</font>

157
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saved us!</font>

158
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful on your way back!</font>

159
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vwe have to cure Inazuma's poisoning.</font>

160
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring all the medicine vyou can find in the medical office!</font>

161
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

162
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm never going back to that Hell!</font>

163
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me neither! I'm turning over a new leaf! I'm gonna go home and be with my family!</font>

164
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are free!</font>

165
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And who do you have to thank for that?</font>

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go on, say it!</font>

167
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Buggy!</font>

168
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought they'd make it that far...</font>

169
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marines, send one of your ships back here.</font>

170
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll come with you, and take them down myself.</font>

171
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.{here}</font>

172
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like they haven't noticed that they're trapped yet.</font>

173
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rear Admiral! We have repaired the cannons that Jinbei disabled.</font>

174
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well.</font>

175
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All ships, open fire!</font>

176
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've started shooting!</font>

177
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really bad!</font>

178
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many ships are there, anyway?!</font>

179
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entire fleet is chasing us!</font>

180
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're hit!{here}</font>

181
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone ranked Vice Admiral or above has already been called to Marineford...</font>

182
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but a warship is a warship. They're still tough, no matter who's onboard!</font>

183
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you realize that it's useless?!</font>

184
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gates of Justice won't open...</font>

185
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to pirate scum like you!</font>

186
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! I forgot about this!</font>

187
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad! These gates will never open for us! {Trying to implement Mr. 3's "randomly ending his words with the word money"-speech quirk in these next few lines so that this dialogue will make sense...}</font>

188
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! We've made it this far, and now we've hit a dead end!{it's too subtle to translate Mr 3's speech quirk. And I think he's just saying the
2 particles "ga" and "ne" instead of "money". For the "dont imitate me" part we can
just make Luffy sound all panicky instead of introducing all these extra lines.}</font>

189
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't imitate me! {here}</font>

190
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're we gonna do, you damn shark?!</font>

191
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll break through!</font>

192
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just impossible!</font>

193
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the worst possible situation!</font>

194
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you be so calm?!</font>

195
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all, we've gotta protect the ship! Don't let them sink it!</font>

196
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you just gonna sit back and take their attacks?</font>

197
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a warship too, remember?</font>

198
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you gonna shoot back, you worthless fools?!</font>

199
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was gonna be my suggestion! {here}</font>

200
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's shoot back at them, men!</font>

201
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood, Captain Buggy!</font>

202
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sables!</font>

203
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gomu Gomu no Balloon!</font>

204
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's that?!</font>

205
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn these prisoners...</font>

206
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must have realized that they're trapped, so why are they still heading towards the Gates of Justice?</font>

207
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gates can only be opened by operators inside Impel Down.</font>

208
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no other way to open them!</font>

209
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire! Send them to the bottom of the sea!</font>

210
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gates of Justice are opening!</font>

211
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?! What's going on?!</font>

212
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are the Gates opening?!</font>

213
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's open!</font>

214
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-How can this be?</font>

215
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it a trap?!</font>

216
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I don't know why, but the Gates are opening!</font>

217
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

218
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan! Hurry aboard!</font>

219
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, wait!</font>

220
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible! Why are the Gates opening?!</font>

221
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure opening the Gates was a good idea...</font>

222
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan?</font>

223
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, this will do. Have my orders ever been wrong? {releasing that rain dude seemed like a winner}</font>

224
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's not that I doubt you...</font>

225
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As soon as their ship has passed through, you are to close the Gate immediately.</font>

226
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you understand?</font>

227
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well, Sir.</font>

228
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them escape!</font>

229
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Letting them get away is unforgivable! Fire!</font>

230
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are these Magellan's orders? What is he thinking?!</font>

231
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't understand what he intends to achieve by doing this.</font>

232
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is Warden Magellan thinking?!</font>

233
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, well, I don't think this was done by the Warden.</font>

234
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just standing on the bridge by the main entrance.</font>

235
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why-? What is happening?!</font>

236
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Control Room! What are you doing?!</font>

237
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who told you to open the Gates of Justice?!</font>

238
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden?!</font>

239
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my.</font>

240
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that really true?</font>

241
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bon-chan...?</font>

242
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

243
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

244
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

245
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I tricked you again!</font>

246
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a fake?!</font>

247
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! The Gates are closing!</font>

248
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're closing!</font>

249
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can get through, the Navy will be trapped on the other side!</font>

250
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just with us at the exit!</font>

251
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only reason we managed to meet Iva-chan and the others,</font>

252
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and escape from there, was because Bon-chan was with us!</font>

253
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're telling me we should just go on without him?!</font>

254
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time to waste.</font>

255
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are we just gonna abandon him?!</font>

256
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already abandoned countless allies who fell along the way!</font>

257
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you intend to return there and fight Magellan again?!</font>

258
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then there will be even more sacrifices!</font>

259
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd waste even more time, too!</font>

260
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If someone hadn't stayed behind, the Gates would never have opened for us!</font>

261
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm the one who can pull it off best.</i></font>

262
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll open the Gates of Justice!</i></font>

263
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And what do you intend to do afterwards?</i></font>

264
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If I told you that, it wouldn't be as cool, would it?</i></font>

265
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't tell Straw-chan anything before we part ways!</i></font>

266
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Words are not needed for an Okama's parting.</i></font>

267
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's still connected.</font>

268
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Baby Snail Phone has a very short range.</font>

281
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just like you did last time?!</font>

282
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbei! Didn't you promise not to tell him before we'd lost contact?!</font>

283
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weren't we gonna escape together?!</font>

286
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that how it is...?</font>

287
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Okama-guy...</font>

292
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,830

315
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sink them!</font>

318
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Quit joking around!</i></font>

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw-chan! I've come to save you!</i></font>

320

322
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,370

326
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They got away!</font>

327
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he hadn't been here, we'd be at the bottom of the ocean by now!</font>

328
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even in Hell, there is a single blooming flower of friendship.</font>

329
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It rocks back and forth over the waves,</font>

330
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">leaving one single petal behind as a memento.</font>

331
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someday, it will certainly bloom.</font>
