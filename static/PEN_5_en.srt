252
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,370

253
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,250

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So scary!</font>

267
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like a black hole on the ground!</font>

268
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like we could get sucked in!</font>

269
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and escape!</font>

270
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Find shelter!</font>

271
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take refuge in the forest!</font>

272
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run to the coast!</font>

273
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darkness is gravity.</font>

274
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The power to drag in everything...</font>

275
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and to keep all light from escaping,</font>

276
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">infinite gravity.</font>

277
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even so, it doesn't seem to be reaching me.</font>

278
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not going after you yet...</font>

279
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just stand there and take a look at the town.</font>

280
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Hole!</font>

281
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The town is... being swallowed into the ground!</font>

282
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

283
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's going on?!</font>

284
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gravity of darkness condenses every object with its infinite power.</font>

285
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crushing them!</font>

286
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I dreaming?</font>

287
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our town has...</font>

288
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has it vanished?</font>

289
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now I'll show you...</font>

290
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What became of it!</font>

291
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liberation!</font>

292
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The town has...</font>

293
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turned into just a pile of wood.</font>

294
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get it now, Ace?!</font>

295
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the power I've gained!</font>

296
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Firefly...</font>

297
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fiery Doll!</font>

298
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot!</font>

299
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand pretty well the greatness of the power of darkness.</font>

300
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, this is quite strange...</font>

301
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're a logia, you should be able to dodge an attack such as this.</font>

302
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already told you...</font>

303
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darkness drags in everything.</font>

304
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bullets, blades, strikes, fire and even lightning.</font>

305
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't dodge attacks like the rest of you do.</font>

306
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body absorbs much more pain than a normal human.</font>

307
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, in exchange for that risk there's one more thing I'm capable of absorbing!</font>

308
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dark Vortex!</font>

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gravity of darkness can accurately absorb the "entity" of a devil fruit user!</font>

310
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gravity?!</font>

311
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And thus, my body can...!</font>

312
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is it?</font>

313
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you figured it out yet, Ace?</font>

314
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...!</font>

315
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been a while since someone actually hit you, right?</font>

316
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace.</font>

317
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You understood the moment I grabbed you.</font>

318
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other thing my darkness can absorb is...</font>

319
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Devil fruit powers!</font>

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, by being touched, those with devil fruit abilities are unable to use their ability!</font>

321
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Logia, Zoan, Paramecia....</font>

322
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All those overconfident devil fruit users in the world...</font>

323
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've obtained the ability to expose their weakness!</font>

324
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's fine if I don't get caught.</font>

325
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just proved to you that you can't get away from the gravity of darkness!</font>

326
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dark Vortex!</font>

327
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">St. Elmo's Fire!</font>

328
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace...!</font>

329
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

330
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A flame lance?!</font>

331
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He almost broke my neck!</font>

332
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite a troublesome ability he has.</font>

333
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cross Fire!</font>

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another banana rock is being destroyed...</font>

335
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

336
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't humane.</font>

337
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only this town...</font>

338
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole island will get...!</font>

339
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always thought that devil fruit users relied too much on their abilities,</font>

340
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and if they happened to lose them, they would become rather fragile, but...</font>

341
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected of a Commander on Whitebeard's ship...</font>

342
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His basic combat abilities are also quite fearsome.</font>

343
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, today once again...</font>

344
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fate has separated our ways.</font>

345
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything is useless before darkness.</font>

346
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even that strength of yours.</font>

347
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, it would be a shame to waste that power.</font>

348
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace! Join my crew!</font>

349
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I surrender my power to you, then there was no point in me being a man.</font>

350
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I definitely won't live with regrets.</font>

351
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got that, idiot?</font>

352
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long can you keep living like that in this world...</font>

353
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame, Ace.</font>

354
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die by the darkness!</font>

355
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great Flame Commandment...!!</font>

356
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flame Emperor!!!</font>

357
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sun or the darkness.</font>

358
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There can only be one winner!</font>

359
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make Whitebeard...</font>

360
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The King.</font>

361
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Grand Line Banaro Island duel...</i></font>

362
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The fight between those two pirates,</i></font>

363
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Will be remembered as the trigger for a big event that has yet to come.</i></font>
