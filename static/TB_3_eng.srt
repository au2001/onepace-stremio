112

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zombies?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up with this place?</font>

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You live here, you should know!</font>

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you were attacked?</font>

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you made it here safely.</font>

118
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great.</font>

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for your question, here's my answer:</font>

120
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I live here because I don't know what those things are.</font>

121
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you're here to research the zombies, Doctor?!</font>

122
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

123
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans have a horrible fear of zombies.</font>

124
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we look at it as people coming back from the dead instead...</font>

125
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then isn't it the immortality all humans strive for?</font>

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone has one or two deceased people close to them that they wish to see again...</font>

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With medical science, we are capable of controlling whether people live or die, fearless of the gods!</font>

128
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was for that reason I went exile to begin my research on this mysterious island.</font>

129
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Really?</font>

130
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you succeed, there'll be tons of people that'll be happy!</font>

131
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cheer you on, Doctor Hogback!</font>

132
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, thank you, Doctor Chopper.</font>

133
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">E-Even if you call me a doctor, I'm not happy, asshole!</font>

134
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can I have your autograph?</font>

135
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, sure.</font>

136
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To Doctor Chopper-kun,</font>

137
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And later, can I see your lab?</font>

138
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you <i>ever</i> even look at my lab...!</font>

139
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Cindry-chan, can't you at least put the pudding on a plate?</font>

140
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or is it hopeless to ask?!</font>

141
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish for all plates to be gone.</font>

142
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, don't worry, we keep the tablecloth clean just for occasions like this!</font>

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, let's eat!</font>

144
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You could at least use a spoon!</font>

145
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! It's really sweet and good!</font>

146
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have prepared the bath.</font>

147
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're all dirty, so you can use it.</font>

148
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, old man!</font>

149
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is all fine, but...</font>

150
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't happen to see a weird skeleton pass by, did you?</font>

151
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A skeleton?</font>

152
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

153
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's got an afro, he's real tall...</font>

154
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really light...</font>

155
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I guess it's weird enough being a walking, talking skeleton.</font>

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know anything about it?</font>

157
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I don't.</font>

158
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

159
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh well.</font>

160
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do they mean that guy?</font>

161
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... it can't be...</font>

162
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Mansion's Bath</font>

163
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't really have any interest in seeing human women naked...</font>

164
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I do wanna sneak a peek at Doctor Hogback's lab.</font>

165
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But really, Nami,</font>

166
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">why do we have to keep watch for you like this?</font>

167
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're that scared, you could've skipped the bath!</font>

168
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know, for being grabbed by zombies like that, you two sure don't seem to care.</font>

169
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're filthy!</font>

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just gonna get dirty again!</font>

171
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

172
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tonight, we're leaving.</font>

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you, stupi-</font>

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They told us we could spend the night.</font>

175
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know what could happen to us if we went out tonight?!</font>

176
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, we're not gonna go anywhere else.</font>

177
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy and the others are gonna come and save us.</font>

178
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay?</font>

179
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I agree!</font>

180
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna go back out there!</font>

181
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like that forest, nor the graves! {The line is too long for the sub, but how about "I don't like neither the forest, nor the graves!". Also, I believe Chopper is saying something like "Neither the forest nor the graves!", so we could use that too as continuation of the previous line.}</font>

182
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The inside is the same as the outside.</font>

183
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you taken a good look around?</font>

184
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'm not mistaken,</font>

185
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The halls and rooms are full.</font>

186
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This mansion is filled with zombies.</font>

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Where are they?!</font>

188
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the most suspicious of all is Hogback himself.</font>

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's definitely lying.</font>

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he really didn't have any connection to the zombies like he says,</font>

191
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">why would he be living in a mansion filled with them?</font>

192
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What about you, Chopper?</font>

193
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's really true, then...</font>

194
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...</font>

195
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So for now, we'll just pretend we don't know,</font>

196
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we'll leave tonight.</font>

197
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, well, what a tricky girl.</font>

198
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Chopper, did one of you say something?</font>

200
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't say anything.</font>

201
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I just farted!</font>

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ew, gross, Usopp!</font>

203
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Usopoo!</font>

204
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You damn...!</font>

205
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?</font>

206
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nobody here...!</font>

207
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Compared to that woman on the ship...</font>

208
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a lot weaker - more my type.</font>

209
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone here...!</font>

210
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Cho-</font>

211
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... are going to be my bride.</font>

212
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Nami, what happened?</font>

213
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you smell Usopp's fart in here too?</font>

214
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much!</font>

215
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're thanking her?</font>

216
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out...</font>

217
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid, help me...!</font>

218
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you...!</font>

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Chopper, help!</font>

220
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone here!</font>

221
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's right, I can smell it!</font>

222
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still?</font>

223
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry!</font>

224
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not the fart, a person!</font>

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's going out the window!</font>

226
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is the window doing that on its own?</font>

227
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's getting away?</font>

228
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Deadly Gunpowder Star!</font>

229
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if he got away...</font>

230
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He heard our whole conversation...</font>

231
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, Nami, what just happened?</font>

232
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it!</font>

233
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was here the whole time...</font>

234
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An invisible man.</font>

235
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no good.</font>

236
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,870
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Meanwhile... in the Thousand Sunny
Luffy and the Others</font>

237
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what we do, we can't get out.</font>

238
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From this huge spiderweb...</font>

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That skeleton's ship is stuck too, just like the Sunny.</font>

240
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the Mini Merry Usopp and the others were riding is stuck here too.</font>

241
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:27,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With the front gate like that, it's almost like it's calling to you.</font>

242
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn.</font>

243
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can almost see all the little ghosts beckoning us in.</font>

244
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you going on about over there, Zoro?</font>

245
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to come too!</font>

246
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you stay here you'll just be bored.</font>

247
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

248
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can even share some of my bento! {Zoro share Luffy's bento with Luffy? -_-} {Also, it should probably be "You can even share some of my bento!", with the respective changes}</font>

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are there stairs all of a sudden?</font>

250
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's 'cause this is the entrance!</font>

251
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, it's full of skeletons.</font>

252
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Cerberus?</font>

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell would probably be safer than this place.</font>

254
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's cute.</font>

255
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think it can fight?</font>

256
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dunno.</font>

257
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think it tastes good?</font>

258
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wants a fight now.</font>

259
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'll just...</font>

260
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, hold on.</font>

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna try taming it.</font>

262
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, I know it's a dog, but come on.</font>

263
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks more like a boss or something.</font>

264
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dog like dog.</font>

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There there...</font>

266
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Paw!</font>

267
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right after we warned him...</font>

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There there, good boy...</font>

269
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There there...</font>

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it, let go nice and easy...</font>

271
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a good boy...</font>

272
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

273
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Down.</font>

274
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just wrong.</font>

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But ignoring that, it has horrible scarring on it.</font>

276
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It simply remaining alive is a mystery in itself.</font>

277
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like a fox got mixed into it, so I doubt it's really a normal animal.</font>

278
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, fun things are just showing up as soon as we get here, it's great!</font>

279
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cerberus-san doesn't seem too happy.</font>

280
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Having it do something like this after losing is really damaging its pride.</font>

281
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san!</font>

282
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

283
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you, Nami-swan!?</font>

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Nami-san!</font>

285
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We left the tunnel, and now we're in a forest?</font>

286
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Nami-san!</font>

287
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is weird.</font>

288
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

289
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An old man tree...</font>

290
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and a unicorn...</font>

291
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are drinking together...!</font>

292
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help!</font>

293
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gotcha!</font>

294
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let me go!</font>

295
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you guys, come be pirates with-</font>

296
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that!</font>

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,420
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Doctor Hogback's Mansion</font>

298
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a close one...</font>

299
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Absalom.</font>

300
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know you're here.</font>

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that commotion just now?</font>

302
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you in the bathing room again?</font>

303
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was looking for a bride. {you need to readd him saying hogback's name}{}{}{}</font>

304
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like that woman.</font>

305
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll make her mine.</font>

306
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you're not getting any of the bounty money.</font>

307
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

308
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, six of them have bounties.</font>

309
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of them is over 100 million,</font>

310
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the captain himself is 300 million!</font>

311
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">300 million?</font>

312
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure, Perona?</font>

313
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The government doesn't put a bounty like that on an ordinary pirate.</font>

314
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now that we know that, we'll put all of our power into capturing them, Absalom.</font>

315
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tonight we have our work cut out for us!</font>

316
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no such thing as an invisible man!</font>

317
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,660
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Inside the Mansion
Second Floor Hallway</font>

318
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was one!</font>

319
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you see him attacking me?!</font>

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, well...</font>

321
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I didn't!</font>

322
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes you did!</font>

323
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're tricking me!</font>

324
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just want me to tell you I saw you naked so you can charge me!</font>

325
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was gonna die!</font>

326
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I'm still gonna charge you.</font>

327
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I don't believe anything we've seen on this island!</font>

328
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen!</font>

329
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The invisible man? Your imagination.</font>

330
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ghosts? Weird birds.</font>

331
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies are a race of...
mysterious underground dwellers!</font>

332
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

333
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true we saw a skeleton brought back to life with a devil fruit.</font>

334
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But!</font>

335
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was just an exception to the rule!</font>

336
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No two people can have the same devil fruit ability,</font>

337
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's no other way people can be brought back to life!</font>

338
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Chopper?</font>

339
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no other way something like that can happen!</font>

340
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even with medicine, there isn't any way something like that should be possible.</font>

341
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

342
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor Hogback is really amazing, and he's researching it.</font>

343
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's possible even something as miraculous as that is going on here!</font>

344
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you trust him a little too much?</font>

345
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor Hogback is a great man!</font>

346
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I respect him a lot!</font>

347
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one in the wrong!</font>

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're saying the doctor and the zombies are together without any proof!</font>

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't shake off the feeling we're being watched...</font>

350
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's weird.</font>

351
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh well...</font>

352
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the room from before, right?</font>

353
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

354
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is it so dark?</font>

355
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Cindry-chan?</font>

357
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor!</font>

358
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd you go?</font>

359
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for the bath...</font>

360
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two of them have retired for the night.</font>

361
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hildon?!</font>

362
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...</font>

363
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just left us out in that graveyard earlier!</font>

364
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had no choice.</font>

365
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I took the horses to go do something, and when I wasn't looking...</font>

366
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're lying!</font>

367
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you on this island are ghouls!</font>

368
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That's insulting.</font>

369
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now if you'll follow me, I'll show you your rooms...</font>

370
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just ignoring all that, and showing us around?!</font>

371
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if that's really the door to hell?</font>

372
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just gonna leave now, sorry.</font>

373
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please let me talk to the doctor again first!</font>

374
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They found us out, Hildon...</font>

375
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please ignore that, and I'll show you your rooms...</font>

376
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright.</font>

377
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've already started to figure it all out...</font>

378
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So before they get away...</font>

379
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is...</font>

380
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that painting...</font>

381
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">talk- talk- talk-</font>

382
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're cute when you're shaking in fear!</font>

383
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

384
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A zombie came out of the picture?!</font>

385
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

387
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The leader of the zombies in this room is I, Buhichuck-sama!</font>

388
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think you'll be able to take even one step out of this room, oink!</font>

389
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That mounted head just talked?</font>

390
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow, ow, ow...</font>

391
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who just stabbed that sword in my back?</font>

392
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like Nami said!</font>

393
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This mansion really is filled with zombies!</font>

394
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

395
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...</font>

396
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this, you stupid rug-bear!</font>

397
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's a candle!</font>

398
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hot, hot!</font>

399
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get it away, I'll burn!</font>

400
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fire, I'm scared!</font>

401
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put it out!</font>

402
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's on the chandelier!</font>

403
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knock him down, fast!</font>

404
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know your weakness!</font>

405
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this, all of you!</font>

406
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that!</font>

407
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and that!</font>

408
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and that!</font>

409
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper, Nami, get to the door!</font>

410
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're getting out of here!</font>

411
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

412
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out!</font>

413
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough!</font>

414
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and get it open!</font>

415
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There're lots of them here too!</font>

416
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, Nami?!</font>

417
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No...!</font>

418
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Don't tell me...</font>

419
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't open!</font>

420
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're trapped!</font>

421
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've really done it now.</font>

422
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You won't get away from us!</font>

423
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Damn pirates!</font>

424
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get down!</font>

425
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

426
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's get out of here!</font>

427
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll go to a different room!</font>

428
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let you get away!</font>

429
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no, no!</font>

430
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

431
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in the fireplace!</font>

432
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nowhere else to run!</font>

433
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?</font>

434
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, they disappeared!</font>

435
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They disappeared into the fireplace!</font>

436
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap, they opened the secret passage!</font>

437
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll be in Hogback-sama's laboratory!</font>

438
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow them!</font>

439
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no good, it's blocked from the other side!</font>

440
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter where they go in this mansion, the other Surprise Zombies are there, oink!</font>

441
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to get out of this tunnel, and stay out of rooms with paintings!</font>

442
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's a room?</font>

443
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there!</font>

444
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More paintings!</font>

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, photos?</font>

446
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good...</font>

447
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They aren't zombies.</font>

448
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't this... that girl?</font>

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The plate-hating one, Cindry-chan?</font>

450
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this place?</font>

451
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I look at her again, she's really pretty...</font>

452
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That servant Cindry-chan...</font>

453
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... is this her room?</font>

454
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, would you really put this many pictures of yourself in your own room?</font>

455
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she had stitches all over her face and body!</font>

456
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... these pictures don't show any at all.</font>

457
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't really be a different person...</font>

458
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe they're really old?</font>

459
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Victoria Cindry.</font>

460
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like she was a really famous actress.</font>

461
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, all of these articles are about her.</font>

462
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An actress?</font>

463
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't they say something earlier about her not being a servant?</font>

464
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something about breaking plates and being thrown out by her husband...</font>

465
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looking at this, I just don't think something like that happened.</font>

466
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was born into a rich family...</font>

467
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was very popular ever since she was a child...</font>

468
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

469
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years ago...</font>

470
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She fell from the stage...</font>

471
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and died!</font>

472
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-What the hell are you talking about?!</font>

473
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's alive, isn't she?!</font>

474
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's not dead, right?!</font>

475
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if that report really is true,</font>

476
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that means she already died once and came back to life!</font>

477
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On this island... those were all real zombies...</font>

478
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What we saw... really were living dead!</font>

479
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just getting even creepier!</font>

481
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish I hadn't known tha-</font>

482
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

483
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Usopp!</font>

484
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that a treasure chest~?</font>

485
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a fast change!</font>

486
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Usopp, open it!</font>

487
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please open it up for me?</font>

488
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, this isn't where we keep the treasure!</font>

489
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jack-in-the-box!</font>

490
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay out!</font>

491
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Painting zombies!</font>

492
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"This isn't where we keep the treasure."</font>

493
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what that jack-in-the-box zombie said.</font>

494
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's the guard.</font>

495
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems as if there are people lost in this mansion.</font>

496
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's you?</font>

497
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That isn't a problem...</font>

498
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will subdue them.</font>

499
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You need to stop trying to make everything your friend!</font>

500
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our crew already has weird shit like a raccoon dog and a robot!</font>

501
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I'm not a robot!</font>

502
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a cyborg, bastard!</font>

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What matters is that you aren't human!</font>

504
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But my base was human!</font>

505
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, your base was a pervert!</font>

506
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, well, if you say it that way...</font>

507
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't a compliment...</font>

508
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I wonder what we'll find next?</i></font>

509
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>This is so much fun!</i></font>

510
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">About that tree person and that unicorn...</font>

511
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

512
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the strange animals we've seen in this forest have similar characteristics...</font>

513
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bandages.</font>

514
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stitches.</font>

515
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And a number tattooed onto them.</font>

516
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A number...</font>

517
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess it does have one.</font>

518
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you mean someone's doing this to them?</font>

519
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, most likely.</font>

520
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm? What's that sound?</font>

521
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There, it's a ghost!</font>

522
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all dancing and wiggling!</font>

523
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cool!</font>

524
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They sound kinda freaky.</font>

525
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll catch one for a pet!</font>

526
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they can phase through things...</font>

527
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

528
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fresh Fire!</font>

529
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that didn't work either.</font>

530
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm worthless.</font>

531
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This week's me is just completely worthless. {Should it really remain "This week's me", instead of "This week I'm"?}</font>

532
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what I do, I fail.</font>

533
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have the will to live...</font>

534
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hear the whole world booing at me...</font>

535
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you getting so depressed?!</font>

536
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

537
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

538
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to be reborn,</font>

539
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to be a shellfish.</font>

540
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the worst ever...</font>

541
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish there was a hole I could be buried in...</font>

542
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really, what the hell are you guys doing?!</font>

543
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps if you're touched by the ghosts, then you have feelings of worthlessness?</font>

544
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That doesn't make sense!</font>

545
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're pathetic.</font>

546
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They never try their hardest anyway,</font>

547
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So these ghosts are able to play games with their hearts.</font>

548
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry I was ever born...</font>

549
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enough of that!</font>

550
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems it's just like Robin-chan said.</font>

551
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even without physical body, they're still able to cause such emotional distress with a simple touch.</font>

552
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they are our enemies, they're very strong.</font>

553
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Definitely.</font>

554
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This really is a mysterious island.</font>

555
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, next time I see those ghosts, I'm not holding back!</font>

556
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I won't get one as a pet, I don't want it!</font>

557
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've gotta have a weakness!</font>

558
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I'll get rid of 'em!</font>

559
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, that was just too funny!</font>

560
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

561
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The patchwork animals with numbers may very well be created...</font>

562
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But those ghosts seem to be something entirely different.</font>

563
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys were on the boat too.</font>

564
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get the feeling they're showing up every once in a while just to spy on us...</font>

565
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the question is, who's behind all of this?</font>

566
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, what a huge graveyard!</font>

567
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is really cool!</font>

568
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, let's eat our bento here!</font>

569
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, if you eat it here, the food will taste nasty!</font>

570
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There, there, there...</font>

571
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why the hell would I wanna go back?!</font>

572
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it a badly injured old guy?</font>

573
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a zombie, obviously!</font>

574
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Underestimating us zombies...</font>

575
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is something you shouldn't do!</font>

576
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are zombies really this lively?</font>

577
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll show you how dangerous zombies really are!</font>

578
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you wanna fight?</font>

579
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we'll show you just how dangerous we are.</font>

580
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">600 Million Belly Jackpot!</font>

581
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you guys doing here?</font>

582
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, zombie stuff... being buried.</font>

583
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rotting...</font>

584
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, rotting.</font>

585
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, me too.</font>

586
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you messing with me?</font>

587
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no! We're not! We're sorry!</font>

588
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a man with a long nose...</font>

589
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a woman with orange hair...</font>

590
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and a reindeer-like raccoon dog passed through here?</font>

591
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, yes, yes, yes...</font>

592
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we won't tell you!</font>

593
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have orders not to give anyone information like that.</font>

594
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Orders! Orders! Orders! Orders!</font>

595
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? So you absolutely won't tell us?</font>

596
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Orders! Orders! Orders! Orders!</font>

597
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those three came through.</font>

598
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're my friends.</font>

599
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't touch them, right?</font>

600
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh...?!</font>

601
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-They were your friends?</font>

602
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I didn't!</font>

603
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither did I!</font>

604
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell me the truth!</font>

605
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He touched them!</font>

606
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?! Don't sell out a friend!</font>

607
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one that tried to bite them!</font>

608
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We all attacked together.</font>

609
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! Don't say that!</font>

610
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like they headed towards that mansion.</font>

611
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Glad they're okay.</font>

612
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though we still don't know about Brook...</font>

613
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's alright, isn't it?</font>

614
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait a minute!</font>

615
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw you just now.</font>

616
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're terribly strong, right?</font>

617
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you listen to my story for a moment?</font>

618
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're badly wounded. What happened?!</font>

619
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We told you, he's a zombie!</font>

620
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'm a badly wounded old man.</font>

621
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:23,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too easy to confuse! We'll just call you a zombie!</font>

622
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a man I want you to beat.</font>

623
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know you guys can do it!</font>

624
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are so many victims... if he was defeated they would all be saved.</font>

625
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would be so grateful if I got my shadow back.</font>

626
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true! You're missing your shadow too, old man? {Can reorder the sentence to "Old man, you're missing your shadow too?"}</font>

627
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like Brook!</font>

628
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did this?</font>

629
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it someone on this island?</font>

630
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah...</font>

631
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man known as Moriah.</font>

632
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really frightening!</font>

633
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah?</font>

634
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you be referring to...</font>

635
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah?</font>

636
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it, that Moriah!</font>

637
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin, you know him?</font>

638
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know his name very well.</font>

639
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a man whose former bounty exceeds even yours, Luffy...!</font>

640
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah is...</font>

641
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>
