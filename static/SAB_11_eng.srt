00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, that was true?</font>

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing how you helped out these brats,</font>

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that must mean you're still a pirate, at your age...</font>

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rayleigh-san?</font>

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd be able to retire in peace, too.</font>

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirates' sins won't disappear, right?</font>

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Especially not those of the Roger Pirates.</font>

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we were to try and catch you,</font>

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it would require a bit more dedication than we have right now.</font>

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief, Zoro! This old man really is amazing!</font>

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't let them leave, can you, Kizaru-kun?</font>

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me a break, here!</font>

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can't catch these kids...</font>

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we at Navy HQ wouldn't be able to face the Celestial Dragons in Mariejoa.</font>

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you please get out of my way?</font>

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take Zoro and run!</font>

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, Brook!</font>

44
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, only think of how to escape!</font>

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now...</font>

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't...</font>

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beat these guys!</font>

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, great. That's really annoying.</font>

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna use all my cola energy...</font>

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This'll be my last attack!</font>

52
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coup de Vent!</font>

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damned idiot must have felt that!</font>

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pops, thank you!</font>

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem! I'll pray for your safety!</font>

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,600

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Light! He's doing something!</font>

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you pass!</font>

61
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been a long time since I used my sword.</font>

62
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven</font>

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in trouble here...</font>

64
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was expecting things to be easy when I came to this island...</font>

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Worries are also a part of life, Kizaru-kun.</font>

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The light ahead of us disappeared.</font>

67
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like the old man saved us again.</font>

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-T-That was scary!</font>

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like he's the real Dark King.</font>

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've seen anyone stop the old guy.</font>

71
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we're just one step away from catching Roronoa with his bounty of over 100 million...</font>

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">PX-1! Roronoa is half-dead!</font>

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go take him out!</font>

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...</font>

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care of Nami-san! Please go on without me!</font>

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! We'll be alright!</font>

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun?!</font>

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's going after Usopp and the others!</font>

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Put me down...</font>

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll let you escape...</font>

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous! You're even more useless than I am right now!</font>

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're running together!</font>

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what Luffy wanted us to do!</font>

85
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...?!</font>

86
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's here!</font>

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp-san!</font>

88
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp-san, go on ahead!</font>

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Brook!</font>

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know how strong he is, don't you?!</font>

91
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All for one, one for all!</font>

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are times when a man has no choice but to act!</font>

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bone-crushing defeat...</font>

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

96
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come here!</font>

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop right there, you damn bastard!</font>

98
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

99
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My leg...!</font>

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run, Sanji!</font>

101
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's aiming for you!</font>

102
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! Hurry up and go!</font>

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you can see, my subordinates are more than strong enough.</font>

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, I'm sorry! I dropped you!</font>

105
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?</font>

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're in trouble over there!</font>

107
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't even need my broadaxe, will I?</font>

108
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I told you, you don't have time to worry about your friends!</font>

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leg Locked, Heave-Ho!</font>

110
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can that guy's attacks hurt a rubber man like Luffy?!</font>

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

113
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper! Don't stop!</font>

114
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

115
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! They'll all be killed!</font>

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it, Chopper!</font>

118
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you people!</font>

119
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rumble</font>

120
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

121
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the thing from back then!</font>

122
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had heard of this...</font>

124
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's an interesting power, but...</font>

125
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like you've lost your common sense, huh?</font>

126
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, watch out!</font>

127
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Chopper... He did that again?!</font>

128
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know why, but he seems to be distracted by him...</font>

129
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now's our chance!</font>

130
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, Brook! Get up!</font>

131
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry up and get away from here while we have the chance!</font>

132
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's gonna fire another beam!</font>

133
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hurry and wake up, Brook!</font>

134
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, PX-1.</font>

136
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another one showed up!</font>

137
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many of these guys are there, anyway?!</font>

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy...</font>

141
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...He's the real one!</font>

142
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you survived, Roronoa?</font>

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to your mercy...</font>

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H... Hey, Zoro...</font>

145
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to be talking...</font>

146
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

147
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you were to go on a vacation, where would you like to go?</font>

148
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro!</font>

149
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't hurry up and run...</font>

150
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

151
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Z-Zoro...</font>

152
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you!</font>

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do to Zoro?!</font>

154
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was...</font>

155
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just...</font>

156
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Right here!</font>

157
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro...?</font>

158
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Z-Zoro?</font>

159
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro?</font>

160
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

161
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!!!</font>

162
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Chopper!</font>

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be reckless!</font>

164
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro... Where did you go?!</font>

165
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't have any self-control...</font>

166
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regardless, that Kuma boy...</font>

167
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that bastard doing here?</font>

168
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartholomew Kuma...</font>

169
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is why you can't trust pirates!</font>

170
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're surrounded over there, too?</font>

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro just vanished!</font>

172
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does this mean that the real one showed up at last?</font>

173
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no mistake...</font>

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen that ability before...</font>

175
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back at Thriller Bark, he used that...</font>

176
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...To get rid of a girl...</font>

177
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Tnd she never came back!</font>

178
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really bad!</font>

179
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What'd he do to Zoro?!</font>

180
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd he disappear off to?!</font>

181
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no obligation to answer.</font>

182
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the most tight-lipped man in the world.</font>

183
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know if it's true or not, but they say that</font>

184
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">anyone who gets blasted off by his pads</font>

185
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is sent flying through the sky for three days and nights...</font>

186
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody except the person who was sent flying knows where to, though...</font>

187
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it definitely won't be on this island...</font>

188
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or anywhere else where you might meet them anytime soon.</font>

189
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They might end up on the edge of some distant sea.</font>

190
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

191
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say something, you damned freak!</font>

192
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd you send Zoro?!</font>

193
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, he finally showed up...</font>

194
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The real Warlord...</font>

195
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are three of them who look the same...</font>

196
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

197
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th... The real Warlord...</font>

198
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't come any closer!</font>

199
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it... Stop!</font>

200
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got 8000 subordinates, you know!</font>

201
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Can't you hear me?! Don't come any closer!</font>

202
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out, Usopp! Behind you!</font>

203
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behi-?!</font>

204
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay out of this.</font>

205
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He even got rid of his own comrade?!</font>

206
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even PX-1?!</font>

207
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing with your allies, Kuma boy?!</font>

208
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run, the three of you!!</font>

209
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

210
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just run away, everyone!</font>

211
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll think things over once we're safe!</font>

212
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!!!</font>

213
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, let's go!</font>

214
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... Zoro...</font>

215
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like he said, we'll think about that later!</font>

216
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

217
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go! The beam only grazed me!</font>

218
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll lend you my shoulder, quick!</font>

219
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful, you two!</font>

220
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

221
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!!</font>

222
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shall protect you!</font>

223
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it costs me my life!!</font>

224
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Though I am already d-</font>

225
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!!!</font>

226
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it... What am I doing?!</font>

227
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two of my comrades just vanished before my eyes!</font>

228
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

229
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get going, Usopp!</font>

230
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous! We're leaving together, Sanji!</font>

231
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

232
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Sanji!</font>

233
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn pad-bastard!!</font>

234
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

236
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

237
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay away!</font>

238
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

239
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

240
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

242
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

243
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

244
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gunpowder Star!</font>

245
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

246
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

247
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!!</font>

248
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji?</font>

250
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it to hell!</font>

251
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Sanji!</font>

252
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Sanji...</font>

253
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on...?</font>

254
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we gonna do?</font>

255
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's...</font>

257
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The situation over there seems pretty hopeless...</font>

258
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to help them out, but I'm getting too old...</font>

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're holding off a navy admiral on your own,
and you're still trying to do more?</font>

260
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're making me look bad here, so just cut it out already!</font>

261
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the "Dark King", Rayleigh, are you not?</font>

262
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

263
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kuma?</font>

264
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy?</font>

265
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really expect me to believe what you just said?</font>

266
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decide that for yourself.</font>

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am already endangering my own position.</font>

268
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what're you planning to do, Kuma?</font>

269
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as it doesn't directly affect the World Government...</font>

270
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no obligation to get along with the navy.</font>

271
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not answer that question.</font>

272
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

273
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Second!</font>
