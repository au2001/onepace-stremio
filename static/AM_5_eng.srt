22
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I do not wish to refuse Luffy's request...</font>

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I said I would answer the summons...</font>

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even so, I do not feel bad about it!</font>

25
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is love!</font>

00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pain of yearning for the one whom you cannot see will weaken you until you die...</font>

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The previous empresses all fell in love,</font>

28
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">yet as empresses, they had no choice but to
repress their feelings and remain on the island.</font>

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pain from their suppressed feelings began to hurt them,</font>

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and eventually claimed their lives.</font>

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By answering the summons and
maintaining your position as a Warlord,</font>

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you will ensure the country's safety,</font>

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,490

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like he's going to Central with Snake Princess!</font>

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, will that be alright?</font>

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami and Robin should be fine, but men aren't allowed in this country...</font>

46
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they're your friends, then I think it would be fine.</font>

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like this is the saga of "The Snake Princess Made a Special Exception For You", after all.</font>

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be looking forward to it!</font>

49
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The saga of "So, You Were Here"?</font>

50
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who would be so insolent...</font>

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as to leave...</font>

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a puppy and...</font>

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,610

54
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,030

55
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her sexy pranks know no bounds!!</font>

56
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know when it happened, but she's even more beautiful than before!</font>

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry! It was all my fault...</font>

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please be more careful.</font>

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry that we gotta leave so suddenly.</font>

60
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake-woman! I wanna get going as soon as possible!</font>

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no! If I look into his eyes...</font>

62
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Luffy! It's rude of you to call her that!</font>

63
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must address her as "Snake Princess"!</font>

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, call me Hancock.</font>

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, sure thing, Hammock!</font>

67
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's "Hancock".</font>

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Snake Princess is smiling!</font>

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,250

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too bright...</font>

71
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A woman in love...</font>

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was like that once...</font>

73
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Elder Nyon, your face looks all distorted and ugly...</font>

74
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

75
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a safe journey, Snake Princess!</font>

76
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please come again, Luffy!</font>

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chan!</font>

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya la'der!</font>

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that already!</font>

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">See ya la'der!</font>

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you my conditions on the Snail-Phone.</font>

82
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If this is about your request to make a stop at the Great Prison, Impel Down,</font>

83
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I've managed to get permission from above.</font>

84
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates, especially the Seven Warlords, are forbidden to approach the prison.</font>

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only you and that snake will be coming, correct?</font>

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a special case.</font>

87
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time, so you won't be able to stay there for long.</font>

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, Big Sister, please be careful.</font>

89
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure you come back alive, Big Sister.</font>

90
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will pray for your safety, Snake Princess!
Take care, Snake Princess!</font>

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you take care t-</font>

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be going, then.</font>

93
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I leave the kingdom to you for the time being.</font>

94
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

95
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wait was worth it.</font>

96
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, it seems I'll be able to fulfill my mission.</font>

97
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, could you do something about my petrified crew?</font>

98
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they all dead?</font>

99
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awaken.</font>

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...ck-sama!</font>

101
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...What?</font>

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get the ship moving, fools!</font>

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, yes! Right away!</font>

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before we go to Marineford, we head for Impel Down!</font>

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,140
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Navy Headquarters</font>

106
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleet Admiral Sengoku!</font>

107
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotten a message from Vice Admiral Momonga!</font>

108
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently, the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock</font>

109
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">finally responded and is on her way here!</font>

110
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally. I sure hope she makes it in time.</font>

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman is strong.</font>

112
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we have six of the Seven Warlords gathered.</font>

113
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the last one, still sitting in prison?</font>

114
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has he come to his senses?</font>

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, he's still completely against this fight.</font>

116
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems he's even ready to accept losing his position as a Warlord.</font>

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought he'd be our strongest supporter in this case...</font>

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think that he'd be this opposed to it...</font>

119
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn that Jinbei...</font>

120
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporting in!</font>

121
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fleet Admiral!</font>

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's about those 500 pirates that Admiral Kizaru captured on Sabaody Archipelago...</font>

123
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impel Down says they don't have the manpower to handle them all...</font>

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Talk to the Labor Department!</font>

125
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't ask me for anything unrelated to the Whitebeard case!</font>

126
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and the World Noble, Saint Rosward demands...</font>

127
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let the Admirals deal with him!</font>

128
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about Garp?</font>

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-Admiral Garp has gone to Impel Down.</font>

130
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does he think he's doing?!</font>

131
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doing whatever he pleases at such a crucial moment...</font>

132
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,250

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an emergency!</font>

134
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard has made his move!</font>

135
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, he's coming... the patrol ships reported it?</font>

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Patch me through so they can confirm it themselves.</font>

137
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you see...</font>

138
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All 23 ships we had keeping an eye on
Whitebeard's flagship, the Moby Dick...</font>

139
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just vanished. We can't contact them.</font>

140
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

141
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently, there have been suspicious movements among other pirates in the New World as well!</font>

142
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't get any information on how many of them there are or when they will come here!</font>

143
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We sent out another patrol, but...</font>

144
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got us!</font>

145
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's already started to move, hasn't he?</font>

146
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no idea where he'll strike...</font>

147
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as we've got Ace imprisoned...</font>

148
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to tell everyone that it is possible that there might be a showdown in Impel Down!</font>

149
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yessir!</font>

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,660
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Great Prison
Impel Down</font>

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way, Vice-Admiral Garp.</font>

152
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care!</font>

153
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

154
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you sure look pitiful...</font>

155
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still alive there...</font>

156
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace?</font>

157
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man...</font>

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now, we will travel back in time a little...</font>

159
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh dear, oh dear...</font>

160
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...hey...hey...young lady?</font>

161
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...hey...hey...young lady?</font>

162
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you come from, young lady?</font>

163
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit repeating yourself.</font>

164
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

165
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you calmed down?</font>

166
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not gonna attack me any more, are you?</font>

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ta-dah!</font>

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, have a look...</font>

169
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">at these firmly tied "knots of wind"!</font>

170
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Untie one and...</font>

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...it summons a gentle breeze.</font>

172
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Untie another, and...</font>

173
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...it summons a strong wind.</font>

174
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Untie the third, and...</font>

175
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...it summons a storm!</font>

176
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

177
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it would cheer you up...</font>

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel better now, thank you very much!</font>

179
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Weatheria, a small Sky-Island.</font>

180
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a country dedicated to researching weather.</font>

181
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sky-Island?!</font>

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,420

183
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

184
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Taroimo!</font>

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

186
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a human!</font>

187
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, are you alright?</font>

188
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He mistook you for a monster...</font>

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

190
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you be alright?!</font>

191
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, this is bad...</font>

192
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How far did I fly?</font>

193
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ugh, it's cold! Is this a snow-country?!</font>

194
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!</font>

195
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

196
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's walking around in the snow wearing only a speedo!</font>

197
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did someone rob him?</font>

198
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, put on this loincloth.</font>

199
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Loincloth?! Get real!</font>

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mind your own business!</font>

201
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I'd...</font>

202
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...put that on...</font>

203
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...I'd be a disgrace...</font>

204
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to all perverts!</font>

205
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow along!</font>

206
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move your butt to the right!</font>

207
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right hand on the hips...</font>

208
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...and thrust your left hand out!</font>

209
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slide...</font>

210
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...to the left!</font>

211
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! Left!</font>

212
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And again!</font>

213
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

214
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One! Two!</font>

215
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super!</font>

216
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whew, this is the best!</font>

217
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still cold!</font>

218
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is this?!</font>

219
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

220
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Mechanical Island's future kingdom of Bulgemore.</font>

229
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,480

Poverty</font>

271
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is this the Devil?</font>

272
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really managed to summon him with our black magic!</font>

273
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a frightening appearance!</font>

274
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's clearly not of this world...</font>

275
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our wish can be fulfilled!</font>

276
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can have our revenge on those people!</font>

277
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have nothing left!</font>

278
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will have our revenge on the Longarm tribe, who have taken everything from us!</font>

279
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King of Demons, Satan-sama...</font>

280
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you will fulfill our wishes,</font>

281
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then every one of us will surrender our very souls to you!</font>

282
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please rain death upon them!</font>

283
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How far can I have flown?</font>

284
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to go back...</font>

285
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back to where the others are!</font>

286
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait!</font>

287
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please do not return to Hell, Satan-sama!</font>

288
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must keep him here, whatever it takes!</font>

289
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe we didn't offer enough sacrifices?</font>

290
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could Satan-sama want?</font>

291
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe a living sacrifice?</font>

292
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blood?</font>

293
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is this place?</font>

294
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me...</font>

295
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May I see your panties?</font>

296
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Panties!</font>

297
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and show him your underwear!</font>

298
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,340

Country on the bridge
Tequila Wolf</font>

299
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a country of laborers.</font>

300
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull! Pull!</font>

301
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people working here are all criminals from other countries,</font>

302
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or inhabitants from countries that
refused to join the World Government.</font>

304
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess you could call them slaves.</font>

305
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When will this bridge be completed?</font>

306
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll probably take a while...</font>

307
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been working on it for seven hundred years, after all.</font>

308
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seven hundred years? What for?</font>

309
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have no need to know.</font>

310
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're one of our workers now,
so you just have to build the bridge!</font>

312
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with these birds?!</font>

313
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're too big!</font>

314
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna eat me?!</font>

315
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body's not listening to me!</font>

316
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... safe...?</font>

317
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a raccoon dog. How rare!</font>

318
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We having raccoon dog stew.</font>

319
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it! I'm a reindeer!</font>

320
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we be having reindeer stew...</font>

321
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? It talk just now?</font>

322
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Legends say that this is a treasure island...</font>

323
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Torino Kingdom where birds reign over humans...</font>

324
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,360

326
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true, I did tell him that...</font>

327
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"If I were to go on a vacation, I'd like to go to a dark, gloomy, haunted old castle...</font>

328
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,020

329
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, Kuma!</font>

330
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But no one told me there wouldn't be any servants here!</font>

331
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one told me that I wouldn't get to wake up in a soft bed, being served a bagel sandwich with warm cocoa!</font>

332
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one told me there wouldn't be any cute stuffed animals here!!!</font>

333
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I? Moria-sama!</font>

334
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to go back to Thriller Bark!</font>

335
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...?</font>

336
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it! Someone else got sent here!</font>

337
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure hope it's somebody cute!</font>

338
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He's...</font>

339
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...one of Straw Hat's crew!</font>

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must have been defeated by Kuma...</font>

341
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't dead yet?</font>

342
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm alive...</font>

343
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?</font>

344
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing here?</font>

345
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I should be asking you that!</font>

346
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crying out all of a sudden...</font>

347
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are my swords?</font>

348
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you want your weapons back?</font>

349
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

350
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Returning to the present...</font>

351
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy intends to help his brother Ace escape,</font>

352
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and is crossing the waves, heading toward Impel Down.</font>

353
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times must I repeat myself before you understand?!</font>

354
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ought to remember it after the first time, you imbecile.</font>

355
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My meals must weigh no less than 100 kilograms!</font>

356
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Any less than that, it will not satisfy my hunger!</font>

357
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you wish for me to turn you to stone again?!</font>

358
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No! Please forgive me!</font>

359
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be more precise this time!</font>

360
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone bring her another meal now!</font>

361
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Is that-?</font>

362
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're examples...</font>

363
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what happens to anyone who tries to peek into Hancock's room!</font>

364
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scary!</font>

365
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here, Luffy. Dig in!</font>

366
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is delicious!</font>

367
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the fact that you're feeding it to me makes the meal even better!</font>

368
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you don't mean that...</font>

369
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only that would happen...</font>

370
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what're you doin' over there in the corner?</font>

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not eating anything? This Sea King-meat tastes awesome.</font>

372
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I am fine...</font>

373
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heart is already full...</font>

374
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure ate a lot!</font>

375
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was great!</font>

376
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Luffy!</font>

377
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten that you are a fugitive?</font>

378
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hancock! Do you have someone else in your room?</font>

379
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no!</font>

380
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lieutenant Stalker, are you sure about what you heard?</font>

381
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yessir! I definitely heard someone say "Bwah! I sure ate a lot"!</font>

382
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think the empress would say something like that?</font>

383
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

384
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that was her, then I'll shave my hair into a Mohawk!</font>

385
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sure ate a lot!</font>

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She said it!</font>

387
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please remove the dishes.</font>

388
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The meal was satisfying.</font>

389
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not forget, I need five portions like this every day.</font>

390
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That much?!</font>

391
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then we won't have anything to eat!</font>

392
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would not care if you were to die.</font>

393
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're horrible!</font>

394
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you're so beautiful~!</font>

395
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,700

397
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">doubling the tension at Navy HQ.</font>

398
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The port of Marineford is now crowded</font>

399
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,720
