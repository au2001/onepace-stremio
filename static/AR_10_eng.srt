<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Do you even have...
a ship's doctor?!</font>

126
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A doctor? That sounds good, too!</font>

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy?</font>

128
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But a musician comes first.
Right, Zoro?</font>

129
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why's that?!</font>

130
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Because pirates sing, you know! </font>

131
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So why does that come first?!</font>

132
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Doctor. Where's Nami?</font>

133
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She doesn't seem to be here, either.</font>

134
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami, huh?</font>

135
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you can't find her around,
then she's probably where she always goes.</font>

136
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?! You're still here, Nami?</font>

137
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Your friends've been looking for you, you know.</font>

138
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Nojiko... Gen.</font>

139
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If Bell-m√®re were alive,</font>

140
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">do you think she'd stop me from being a pirate?</font>

141
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A pirate?!</font>

142
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Give me a break!</font>

143
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's no way she'd ever let
her precious daughter be a pirate!</font>

144
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She wouldn't stop you!</font>

145
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko!</font>

146
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Even if she tried,</font>

147
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">would you really listen to her?</font>

148
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Absolutely not!</font>

149
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Whew, I'm stuffed!</font>

150
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sometimes it's nice to just eat!</font>

151
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are your wounds all better now, Zoro?</font>

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This's nothin'! Some food and drink'll fix it right up!</font>

153
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah?</font>

154
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But how long is this dumb party gonna last?</font>

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is the third day now!</font>

156
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's wrong with that?</font>

157
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">When you wanna celebrate,
you should pull out all the stops.</font>

158
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, Sanji!
That melon you just had!</font>

159
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Was there something on it?!</font>

160
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's with all that meat?!</font>

161
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sure was. It's prosciutto and melon, so there was prosciutto on it.</font>

162
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Prosciutto and melon?! That sounds great! Wh-Where did you get it?!</font>

163
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dunno.</font>

164
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The whole village is a buffet party,
so I dunno where I got it.</font>

165
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's long gone.</font>

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's been eating non-stop for three days straight!</font>

167
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now, then. I'm done eating.</font>

168
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now I think I'll...</font>

169
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">pick up some girls!</font>

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I am Captain Usopp,</font>

171
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Way to go, kiddo!</font>

172
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">the lovable and courageous hero,</font>

173
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Can I have your autograph?!</font>

174
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">who brought down the strongest fishman officer of all!</font>

175
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here's an Usopp anthem!</font>

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who was it? Who was it?
Who beat the fishman?</font>

177
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Hmph. How boring.</font>

178
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What is?</font>

179
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I thought you'd be more down in the dumps.</font>

180
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Like, "Why didn't this happen before my dad died?!"</font>

181
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's how I felt at first.</font>

182
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But now I'm thinking about the future.</font>

183
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The future?</font>

184
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That straw hat guy and his friends helped us out.</font>

185
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But tomorrow, we need to make a fresh start by ourselves.</font>

186
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's no way we can forget the past,</font>

187
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and I don't think we need to.</font>

188
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But what's important is what comes next!</font>

189
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What should we do?
What do we need to do?</font>

190
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're the ones who're gonna sustain our villages now.</font>

191
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's the approach I'm gonna take.</font>

192
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're so precocious!</font>

193
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oww!</font>

194
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why're you pinching me?!
I don't understand! Why?!</font>

195
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And here I was just hoping to tease you again!</font>

196
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You've teased me plenty,
you dumb, tattooed punk girl!</font>

197
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm okay with "punk"!</font>

198
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Will it come off?</font>

199
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'd like to say, "No problem,"</font>

200
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but there's no way to remove it altogether.</font>

201
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There'll be some scarring.
That's how tattoos are.</font>

202
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. I know it's stupid of me.
They're there for life.</font>

203
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I don't want anyone to see this!</i></font>

204
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>This... this tattoo...</i></font>

205
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I don't even want to be
in Arlong's crew,</i></font>

206
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>but it's like I've been
branded a pirate!</i></font>

207
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Nami.</i></font>

208
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Nojiko! What is that?!</i></font>

209
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Oh? You mean this?</i></font>

210
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>It's no big deal!
It's just a decoration!</i></font>

211
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Now I'm just like you!</i></font>

212
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Say, Doctor.</font>

213
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">There's a tattoo I'd like to have.</font>

214
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here.</font>

215
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Those two can dance!</font>

216
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here's Usopp Anthem No. 185!</font>

217
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bell-m√®re,</font>

218
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">your girls have grown up to be positively tough and honorable!</font>

219
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They remind me of you.</font>

220
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're going to live life to its fullest from now on.</font>

221
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We've lost and sacrificed far too much.</font>

222
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Which is why we're gonna smile and laugh like the idiots we are!</font>

223
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Prosciutto and melon!</font>

224
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? There's no food around here.
That's no good. Time to go back.</font>

225
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hold it, boy!</font>

226
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A grave? Did someone die?</font>

227
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. A long time ago.</font>

228
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, my deepest conveniences.</font>

229
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? Deepest concussions.
Huh? Deepest compli‚Äì</font>

230
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Deepest condolences.</font>

231
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's what I meant.</font>

232
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, boy.</font>

233
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami is going aboard your ship.
She's going to be a pirate.</font>

234
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It'll be a dangerous journey.</font>

235
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you guys ever do anything to take away her smile,</font>

236
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I will kill you!</font>

237
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. I'm not gonna do that, though.</font>

238
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Got it?!</font>

239
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I got it!</font>

240
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This the last of it?</font>

241
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah!</font>

242
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Alright!</font>

243
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you finished loading it all?</font>

244
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah!</font>

245
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now, then. We got loads of provisions now.
We're good to go.</font>

246
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We were only here a few days,</font>

247
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but we made tons of memories
on this island, huh?</font>

248
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah!</font>

249
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We owe you so much for everything you've done.</font>

250
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're gonna get back to bounty hunting again!</font>

251
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is goodbye for now,</font>

252
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but we look forward to the day we meet again somewhere!</font>

253
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take care!</font>

254
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You guys, too!</font>

255
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Well, we should get going, too!</font>

256
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! Hold on!
What about Nami?!</font>

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Maybe she's not coming?</font>

258
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why not?!</font>

259
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You! You made another pass
at Nami, didn't you?!</font>

260
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why would I do that?</font>

261
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">No, you definitely did!</font>

262
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, yeah. She achieved her goal,</font>

263
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">You can't stand that Nami</font>

264
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">and I are all lovey-dovey!</font>

265
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and she has no reason to be a pirate,</font>

266
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so she might be happier here.</font>

267
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Are you an idiot?</font>

268
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">What'd you call me?!</font>

269
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What about my happiness?!</font>

270
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If Nami isn't on the ship,</font>

271
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">then 98.72% of my reason for being here is gone!</font>

272
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">By the way, I couldn't find
the prosciutto and melon anywhere!</font>

273
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! Where's Nacchan?</font>

274
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's the thing!
Nobody's seen her since this morning!</font>

275
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?! She's leaving all the money behind?!</font>

276
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The 100 million belly?!</font>

277
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She left it in our house, along with a letter.</font>

278
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She's planning to travel without her money?!</font>

279
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But she risked her life to earn it!</font>

280
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She says it's okay,
because she'll just steal some more.</font>

281
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Once that girl says something,
there's no changing her mind.</font>

282
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That fool! We're the ones who still have so much to thank her for!</font>

283
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

284
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

285
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

286
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

287
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">Nacchan!</font>

288
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Set sail!</font>

289
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Huh? She's started sprinting!</font>

290
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She says to set sail.</font>

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wait!</font>

292
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Does she really intend to leave</font>

293
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">without letting us thank her or say goodbye?!</font>

294
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You can't be serious!</font>

295
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hoist the sails!</font>

296
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">H-Hey!</font>

297
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They're setting sail!</font>

298
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wait! We still haven't thanked you!</font>

299
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop, Nacchan!</font>

300
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">At least let us thank you!</font>

301
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nacchan!</font>

302
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hold it! I won't let you leave like this!</font>

303
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, is this how we should let them say goodbye?</font>

304
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why not? It's her decision.</font>

305
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:40,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

306
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why?!</font>

307
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

308
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:15,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She didn't!</font>

309
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">‚Äì What's this...?!
‚Äì My wallet's gone!</font>

310
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Mine, too!</font>

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Same here!</font>

312
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take care, everyone!</font>

313
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare you!</font>

314
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You damn brat!</font>

315
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, she hasn't changed a bit.</font>

316
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who knows when she'll betray us again.</font>

317
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami! Good job!</font>

318
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You lousy pickpocket!</font>

319
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get back here!</font>

320
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Give back our wallets!</font>

321
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You punk!</font>

322
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Come back anytime!</font>

323
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Take care of yourself!</font>

324
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're grateful to you guys!</font>

325
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Boy!</font>

326
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't forget your promise!</font>

327
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bye, everyone!
I'm heading out!</font>

328
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She got us good!</font>

329
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">My little sister's gonna do great!</font>

330
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Enjoy yourself!</font>

331
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here, Genzo.</font>

332
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's this scrap of paper, Doctor?</font>

333
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That silly girl. She never learns.
She got another tattoo before she left.</font>

334
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What is this symbol?</font>

335
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's a tangerine and a pinwheel, apparently.</font>

336
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh? Gen!
What happened to your pinwheel?</font>

337
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I doubt there's any need for it now.</font>

338
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm heading out!</font>

339
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Hold on, Gen-san!
Stay away from Nami!</i></font>

340
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>No, but, I want to see her smile, too!</i></font>

341
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>She starts crying because you have such a scary face!</i></font>

342
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>But what am I supposed to do about that?</i></font>

343
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I know!</i></font>

344
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>This'll make you laugh, right?!
If I always keep it here like this?!</i></font>

345
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>What do you say, Nami-chan?</i></font>

346
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Look. I really don't think a dumb pinwheel is going to make Nami...</i></font>

347
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Oh. She laughed.</i></font>
