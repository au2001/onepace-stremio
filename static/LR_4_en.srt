76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their boss will probably take part in the next round, right?</font>

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,060

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they could just steal him again!</font>

79

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In which case taking their boss now</font>

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is the best way to get Chopper back and keep him.</font>

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">U-U-Unbelievable! Is he going to call for the Foxy Pirates' captain?!</font>

85
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,740

86
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no rule against it</font>

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but suddenly calling out an opponent's leader after the second round</font>

88
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is an obvious attempt at avoiding a fair-and-square head-on match!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you shut up already?! Quit actin' cocky!</font>

99

102

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll choose me I just know it...</font>

104
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's obvious I'm the only choice here...</font>

105
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he gonna choose me? These guys are cool!</font>

106
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say, Navigator.</font>

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your proposal does give us an overwhelming advantage,</font>

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but that also makes their boss part of our crew.</font>

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No thanks.</font>

110
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that Team Straw Hat's harassment of our boss has ended,</font>

111
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it's time to pick someone!</font>

112
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who will he choose?!</font>

113
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right then. I wanna take back...</font>

114
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper! Come back!</font>

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Choppy!</font>

116
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you! I'm so happy!</font>

117
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't cry! You know we'd never lose!</font>

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss has sunk into the ground from the weight of his feelings!</font>

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe they all rejected our boss like that!</font>

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Boss! It's okay! We need you!</font>

121
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We do, Boss!</font>

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Guys...</font>

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's teach these guys a lesson!</font>

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! I can't wait for the next round!</font>

125
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We love you, Boss!</font>

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

127
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys...</font>

128
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! You are my only true comrades!</font>

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut the crap will ya?</font>

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suggest you all ready yourselves!</font>

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! I'd never lose to you in a fight!</font>

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times must I repeat myself?</font>

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fight and a game are two different things...</font>

136
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At last it's time for the final combat round!</font>

137
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First order of business:
establishing the battlefield!</font>

138
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two competitors spin the cannon!</font>

139
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then...</font>

140
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...wherever it stops will be where--!</font>

141
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! That was clearly not normal!</font>

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The battlefield has been set!</font>

143
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By sheer coincidence it's on the deck of our own Sexy Foxy!</font>

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coincidence my butt! You idiot!</font>

145
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll now explain the rules of combat!</font>

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything within 50 meters of where the cannonball landed is part of the battlefield!</font>

147
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, it's a 100-meter-wide circle!</font>

148
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons are allowed as well as
anything else within the circle!</font>

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only the two competitors are allowed inside the circle!</font>

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knock your opponent out of the circle and you win! That's it!</font>

151
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Note that the air and water inside the circle still counts as in-bounds!</font>

152
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">F! O! X! Y!</font>

153
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Foxy!</font>

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,020

155
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">while an opening fight is being held aboard the Foxy!</font>

162

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me. Where's the participant...?</font>

164
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There! Just take him already!</font>

165
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?! Why does popcorn and a cola cost so much?!</font>

166
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't like it, don't buy it.</font>

167
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lower it 80%!</font>

168
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get outta my face!</font>

169
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The boundaries are in place!</font>

170
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ends the opening entertainment! Thank you for your patience!</font>

171
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,760

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Combat! The bell will ring shortly!</font>

173
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry to the spectator stands everyone!</font>

174
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?</font>

175
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sky is turning dark...</font>

176
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time we're being treated to a captain-versus-captain battle!</font>

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, in the left figurehead corner...!</font>

178
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man who takes on all challengers and boasts a legendary undefeated record</font>

179
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">of 920 wins and 0 losses!</font>

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss Silver Fox Foxy!</font>

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right...</font>

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up Luffy. You ain't your old self no more.</font>

183
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hairstyle arouses a man's true wildness.</font>

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some ask if the champion makes the afro or if the afro makes the champion...</font>

185
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not even modern science can explain it.</font>

186
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy... With an afro on, your punches will have some serious firepower.</font>

187
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Straw Hat?!</font>

188
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he wimp out on us?!</font>

189
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And in the right corner hailing from East Blue!</font>

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The leader of a miniscule pirate band with a 100 million-Berry bounty...</font>

191
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">..."Straw Hat" Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

192
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! The afroed Luffy is all fired up in the right corner!</font>

193
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lookin' sharp Luffy!</font>

194
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you kidding me?</font>

195
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy looks so cool!</font>

196
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He certainly does.</font>

197
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both fighters have stepped onto the battlefield!</font>

198
00:11:54,030 --> 00:12:00,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can Straw Hat successfully knock our boss out of the circle and protect his crew and pride?!</font>

199
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or will our boss's legendary undefeated streak strip him of everything he has?!</font>

200
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This final and fateful combat round of the Davy Back Fight is about to begin!</font>

201
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is all this?!</font>

202
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the dressing room.</font>

203
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a gloved fight, so choose anything you like.</font>

204
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

205
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow this is more like a costume room than a dressing room...</font>

206
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at all this stuff! And I can use anything I want Usopp!</font>

207
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey how about this? Does it look good?</font>

208
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... This is it...</font>

209
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Straw Hat! Nice fashion!</font>

210
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your butt is as good as kicked!</font>

211
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep your arms tucked in and show 'im your golden right punch!</font>

212
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! His brotherly soul is burning red-hot!</font>

214
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Letting Usopp be his corner man was a mistake.</font>

215
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wish he'd take this seriously...</font>

216
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't act so confident if I were you, Champion!</font>

217
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's liable to bite your head off! Better watch out!</font>

218
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right, corner man! You're in the way! Scram!</font>

219
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! My job as corner man is over already?!</font>

220
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Corner man out!</font>

221
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get goin' already!</font>

222
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're absolutely right!</font>

223
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need for me to remain here either! I'll leave as well!</font>

224
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? The stands are...!</font>

225
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh cool! I didn't know they did that!</font>

226
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, Straw Hat Luffy. Let's have some fun!</font>

227
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This entire ship is our battlefield! Rampage to your heart's desire!</font>

228
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have plenty of skilled shipwrights, you see!</font>

229
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By sheer luck this bout is taking place aboard the Sexy Foxy!</font>

230
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of deadly struggle is about to unfold?!</font>

231
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two pirates are now all alone inside the spacious battlefield!</font>

232
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

233
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep your undefeated streak going!</font>

234
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Win, Luffy! You hafta win!</font>

235
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His beam! Watch out for his beam!</font>

236
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excitement fills the stands!</font>

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's plunder or be plundered!</font>

238
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's one match only with no time limit!</font>

239
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silver Fox Foxy versus Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

240
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a head-to-head battle between these two pirate powerhouses!</font>

241
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fate of everything hangs in the balance!</font>

242
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here comes...</font>

243
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...the starting bell!</font>

244
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it!</font>

245
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

246
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum-Gum... Pistol!</font>

247
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

248
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only my fist is slow!</font>

249
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not so tough! You're all show!</font>

250
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

251
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come back!</font>

252
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow...</font>

253
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!</font>

254
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just kidding!</font>

255
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha...?!</font>

256
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

257
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

258
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's floating! He's slow even when falling?</font>

259
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told him to watch out for that!</font>

260
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aww... Crap...</font>

261
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter Straw Hat? Ready to throw in the towel already?!</font>

262
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...what...?</font>

263
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nine-Tails Rush!</font>

264
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Our boss unleashes a fierce attack right off the bat!</font>

265
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat is helpless to do anything!</font>

266
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? He isn't even budging...</font>

267
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's not true!</font>

268
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The effects are slow too that's all!</font>

269
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was just a little "hello."</font>

270
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The punches themselves didn't hurt you too much.</font>

271
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That much is obvious to me, rubber man!</font>

272
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darn... it...</font>

273
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, your thirty seconds are about up!</font>

274
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hitting him all at once!</font>

275
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! He's going overboard!</font>

276
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

277
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap! The Slow-Slow Beam is more dangerous than I thought!</font>

278
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beams sure are nice...</font>

279
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess I shouldn't stretch more than I need to...</font>

280
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd that jerk go?!</font>

281
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I won't get hit by that anymore!</font>

282
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come out, Split-Head!</font>

283
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't take your anger out on the ears!</font>

284
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Another Slow-Slow?!</font>

285
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome to my ship!</font>

286
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...!</font>

287
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got me!</font>

288
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down, will you?</font>

289
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm trying to show you some hospitality here...</font>

290
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those cannonballs have been Slow-Slow-ed...</font>

291
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can ride one then I can too!</font>

292
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh...! I wouldn't ride that one if I were you...</font>

293
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, or that one.</font>

294
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Told you so!</font>

295
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darn it...</font>

296
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man he's wrecking his own ship...</font>

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just getting started!</font>

298
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Foxy Face Bombs!</font>

299
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Freaky!</font>

300
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Pin badges? They're bigger than the one I bought!</font>

301
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we are! We're bombs!</font>

302
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are?! Yikes!</font>

303
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? A bomb just talked!</font>

304
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... the real deal!</font>

305
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry Straw Hat...</font>

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...but I upgraded my gloves!</font>

307
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the Face Bombs' 30 seconds are just about up!</font>

308
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah! Luffy! The body! The body!</font>

309
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh Usopp!</font>

310
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's happening with the fight?</font>

311
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dunno. Beats me.</font>

312
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?!</font>

313
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">E-Explosions suddenly rock our ship...</font>

314
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...which just happens to be the battlefield...</font>

315
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">caused by Foxy Face Bombs that also happened to be loaded...!</font>

316
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Making their ship the battlefield is such a dirty trick!</font>

317
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Luffy! What's going on?!</font>

318
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Simmer down!</font>

319
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Using this to his advantage, our boss succeeded in blowing up Straw Hat Luffy with a cannon attack!</font>

320
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it all over for him?! He's nowhere to be seen!</font>

321
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whew, that was close!</font>

322
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, it was a--!</font>

323
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

324
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit it! You're annoying!</font>

325
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy is... alive!</font>

326
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You serious?!</font>

327
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's mind-boggling!</font>

328
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He somehow evaded the close-range cannon barrage!</font>

329
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What speed! I-Is this the true power of a man worth 100 million?!</font>

330
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it is!</font>

331
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just finish 'im already!</font>

332
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! But it looks like our boss's next attack is already underway!</font>

333
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From out of the resulting smoke screen comes our boss's disturbing laughter!</font>

334
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But where exactly is he?!</font>

335
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does "Silver Fox" Foxy have up his sleeve this time?!</font>

336
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

337
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I hope you're ready!</font>

338
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got blown up?!</font>

339
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did not! Don't be stupid!</font>

340
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar!</font>

341
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't assume for one minute you'll leave this battlefield alive!</font>

342
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam--!</font>

343
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?!</font>

344
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum Hook!</font>

345
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No more beams for you! I'm gonna smash your arms!</font>

346
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He disappeared into the smoke again!</font>

347
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! There you are!</font>

348
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? A board?!</font>

349
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

350
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then! Which one is me? Where will the beam come from?!</font>

351
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Darn it! How should I know?! They all look like stupid-heads!</font>

352
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid-heads...</font>

353
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There!</font>

354
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you call yourself a warm-hearted individual?!</font>

355
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in for it now! Look up!</font>

356
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

357
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap! A trap door!</font>

358
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what you get for being distracted!</font>

359
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who told me to look up!</font>

360
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You might wanna pay more attention!</font>

361
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

362
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What the...?! Whoa! The floor's moving!</font>

363
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's dragging me away!</font>

364
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's Luffy!</font>

365
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd he come out of there?!</font>

366
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! He'll lose if he falls into the water!</font>

367
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't gonna fall in...!</font>

368
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So close!</font>

369
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah it'd be no fun if it ended so soon!</font>

370
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there, Straw Hat!</font>

371
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Geez! What's with this ship?!</font>

372
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd you go, fox?!</font>

373
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

374
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Foxy pin eerily taunts Straw Hat Luffy after his narrow escape!</font>

375
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In there!</font>

376
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The inside of the ship is our boss's playground! Will Luffy be lured in?!</font>

377
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Luffy! It's totally a trap!</font>

378
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He obviously has a bunch of booby traps set!</font>

379
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That jerk! I'm gonna beat his brains out!</font>

380
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy rushes right in!</font>

381
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The battle has moved inside but I can't enter to give the play-by-play!</font>

382
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the true essence of this round:
a solitary battle between two combatants!</font>

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get up! Get up Luffy! Remember your painful training!</font>

384
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit playin' around and sit down. I can't see.</font>

385
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, a gun deck!</font>

386
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, it's big! I bet Usopp would love this!</font>

387
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, where is he?!</font>

388
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

389
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! He's coming after me...!</font>

390
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now he'll bust through the door at breakneck speed!</font>

391
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Little does he know...</font>

392
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...that this room is filled with spikes!</font>

393
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, rush in and get--</font>

394
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh. There he is.</font>

395
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa what's with that room?</font>

396
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who fires cannons inside other people's ships?! Seriously!</font>

397
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh. It's coming back.</font>

398
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have some nerve! Are you trying to kill me?!</font>

399
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

400

401
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! He's running away!</font>

402
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}"Infirmary"</i></font>

403
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back here!</font>

404
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does this brat have any common sense?!</font>

405
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it! Foxy Face Transformation!</font>

406
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop right there, fox!</font>

407
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A person?</font>

408
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dear me!</font>

409
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever's the matter? Do you feel sick?</font>

410
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you sick? The head? Are you sick in the head?</font>

411
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Huh?! Did anyone just come in here?</font>

412
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No I didn't see anyone. But never mind that...</font>

413
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you? Your face?</font>

414
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's weird... I'm sure I saw him--</font>

415
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! That woman looked like him!</font>

416
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be?!</font>

417
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you! You're that guy's sister aren't you?!</font>

418
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Counter Fox Blow!</font>

419
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool!</font>

420
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this thing?!</font>

421
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's weird! He really was in this room!</font>

422
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he even trying to fight?!</font>

423
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! The kitchen!</font>

424
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fish fish! Cut it up sour it up! Carpaccio!</font>

425
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grill up a sole fa-mi-re-do!</font>

426
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Can I help you?</font>

427
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you seen a fox with its head split in two who looks like a real moron?!</font>

428
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's going too far...!</font>

429
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's you!</font>

430
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the lady in the infirmary too!</font>

431
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing too?!</font>

432
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

433
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh... no...</font>

434
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nine-Tails Rush!</font>

435
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think I lured you in here without a reason.</font>

436
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go check out what's waiting for you when you get sent flying!</font>

437
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It ain't a living creature.</font>

438
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'd be against the rules after all.</font>

439
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While a Slow-Slow Beam is in effect any impacts given are stored up and then go off all at once.</font>

440
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go on now! Your life's final stop lies ahead!</font>

441
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">30 seconds are up.</font>

442
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Where is he?</font>

443
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm... right here!</font>

444
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feh-feh-feh-feh-feh!</font>

445
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And another feh!</font>

446
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am Pilot Foxy! And...</font>

447
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...let me introduce you to the Gorilla Puncher 13!</font>

448
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A gorilla-like punching machine that's had every single flaw ironed out through constant improvement!</font>

449
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the gorilla face really necessary?!</font>

450
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excellent point!</font>

451
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean shut up! Who asked you?!</font>

452
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Gorilla Puncher 13!</font>

453
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is it moving on its own?</font>

454
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a secret...!</font>

455
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're sure sweatin' a lot...</font>

456
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

457
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think you can dodge these measly punches don'tcha?</font>

458
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

459
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Where are you aiming--?</font>

460
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look behind you!</font>

461
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Who's that?! A mirror?!</font>

462
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Mirrors reflect Slowmo Photons!</font>

463
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got ya!</font>

464
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch! Ouch!</font>

465
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh that hurt? Too hot for you?</font>

466
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I forgot to mention that this thing's punches are flaming hot!</font>

467
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Better watch out! Not even Sea Kings can withstand a beating from this!</font>

468
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mirror Racket!</font>

469
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just getting started!</font>

470
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slowpoke Ball Demon Coach! A two-sided attack with bouncing beams and punches!</font>

471
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, this is irritating! If I can just get close to him...!</font>

472
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep running! You'll end up squished between the gorilla and the mirror!</font>

473
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it!</font>

474
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought of that!</font>

475
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

476
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gum-Gum Pistol!</font>

477
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got him!</font>

478
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam! Beam! Beam!</font>

479
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fool!</font>

480
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gorilla Punch Golden Hits!</font>

481
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Round Three of this second Davy Back Fight, the combat round, is underway!</font>

482
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening now is anyone's guess, but there's no doubt</font>

483
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a truly epic battle is taking place inside the ship!</font>

484
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Despite not being able to see him, the crowd cheers for our boss!</font>

485
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ain't gonna lose!</font>

486
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course not! He's Luffy! And he has a 'fro!</font>

487
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being Luffy is more than enough.</font>

488
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damn fox...</font>

489
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's so special about an afro?</font>

490
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it power you up or something?!</font>

491
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is taking longer than usual...</font>

492
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, the guy is made of rubber.</font>

493
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's made of rubber and has a 'fro!</font>

494
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously, what's that have to do with anything?!</font>

495
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my! There's activity on the deck!</font>

496
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who has the upper hand?!
Or could the fight be over now?!</font>

497
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see two figures!</font>

498
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss is the one still standing!</font>

499
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!</font>

500
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile Straw Hat is charred black!</font>

501
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He seems to have taken some seriously heavy punches!</font>

502
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

503
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's impossible...</font>

504
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could some simple punches burn him?! What did he do?!</font>

505
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!</font>

506
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy is up!</font>

507
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just when it seemed he was down for the count he got back up!</font>

508
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like you barely pulled through, Straw Hat...</font>

509
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the brotherly soul! Afro power!</font>

510
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kick his butt, Boss!</font>

511
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

512
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Slow-Slow Beam Sword!</font>

513
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've restrained your arms and legs! But feel free to move anything else!</font>

514
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!</font>

515
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rush!</font>

516
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rush!</font>

517
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rush!</font>

518
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rush!</font>

519
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">30 seconds.</font>

520
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's down for sure this time... No, wait!</font>

521
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

522
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy is up!</font>

523
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! Who is this guy?!</font>

524
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gotta be the 'fro! Is it the afro's wildness?!</font>

525
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stubborn little...!</font>

526
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!</font>

527
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slow-Slow Beam!</font>

528
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Megaton Nine-Tails Rush!</font>

529
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, that's not fair! That beam's against the rules!</font>

530
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

531
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! This looks like the end...!</font>

532
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dealing the punches ain't so easy either!</font>

533
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's beating him to death out there!</font>
