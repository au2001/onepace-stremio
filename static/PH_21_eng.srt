00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

135
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Mocha hasn't woken up yet.</font>

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha was fighting to help us, right?</font>

137
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know that Master was such a bad guy.</font>

138
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a bit fuzzy, but I remember
Mocha coughing up blood and collapsing!</font>

139
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Raccoon Dog-kun.</font>

140
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, I'm a reindeer.</font>

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha's gonna be okay, isn't she?</font>

142
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go home together, right Raccoon Dog-kun?</font>

143
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

144
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're getting out of this nightmare.</font>

145
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the orange-haired lady?</font>

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's the one that's going to take us home, right?</font>

147
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want to thank her!</font>

148
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let's save these children!</i></font>

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>How am I supposed to turn my back...</i></font>

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>On children who are crying for help?!</i></font>

151
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello.</font>

152
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From now on, the Navy will take care of you.</font>

153
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

154
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the robot?</font>

155
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the rubber-man?</font>

156
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the guy with the curly eyebrows?</font>

157
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That smells great!</font>

158
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what Sanji's making.</font>

159
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait.</font>

160
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami?</font>

161
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you worked things out with the Navy?</font>

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

163
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to leave everything to the Navy.</font>

164
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may have told them that I'd save them...</font>

165
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we're pirates
and that would probably make things difficult.</font>

166
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we'd probably wind up
being blamed for their abductions.</font>

167
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's best to leave them
with people on the justice side of the line.</font>

168
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

169
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also...</font>

Allow me to take care of the children!</i></font>

172
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Female marines?</font>

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're reassuring to me.</font>

175
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, your mom was a marine, wasn't she?</font>

176
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's always best to be saved by a strong, kind-hearted female marine.</font>

177
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think so too.</font>

178
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to hear that from you.</font>

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you're the one that said it!</font>

184
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then take your time and savor the meal,
starting with the soup.</font>

185
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks so good!</font>

186
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really hungry, right?</font>

187
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Momo, Sanji's food is the best.</font>

188
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no need for it!</font>

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am not hungry in the slightest!</font>

190
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait you brat!</font>

191
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you gonna do with that dish?!</font>

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't forgive anyone that wastes food,
even if they're a kid!</font>

193
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shall eat.</font>

194

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey.</font>

195
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Delicious!</font>

196
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

197
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel stronger!</font>

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What delicious food!</font>

199
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Delicious.</font>

200
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father...!</font>

201
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us accept their food.</font>

202
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The truth is that they saved my life.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may trust these people.</font>

204

205
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have done well to endure.</font>

206
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must have been hard.</font>

207
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright now.</font>

208
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us believe that the others have endured as well.</font>

209
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, we shall continue to live, Momonosuke!</font>

210
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

211
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?
Is it so delicious that it makes you cry?</font>

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No you idiot, they've clearly been through a lot.</font>

213
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what happened to these guys?</font>

214
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm?</font>

215
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to
the line between good and evil, you jerks?!</font>

216
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a truce, bro.</font>

217
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay then, why don't you guys
go get some booze from the tanker?</font>

218
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With pleasure.</font>

219
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some juice as well!</font>

220
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hatter.</font>

221
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to leave this place quickly.</font>

222
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay and eat, new enemies will arrive.</font>

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell everyone else.</font>

225
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, got it.</font>

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's party!</font>

227
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Cheers!</i></font>

228
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father...</font>

229
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A warrior shouldn't let anyone see their tears.</font>

230
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that supposed to be, Luffy?</font>

231
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cheers, bro.</font>

232
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

233
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait for it...</font>

234
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One, two, three!</font>

235
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here you go.</font>

236
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

237
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mocha!</font>

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-Admiral Smokey!</font>

239
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go back inside.</font>

240
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

241
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We made Caesar spill the weakness of the poison gas.</font>

242
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our comrades are still alive and we can still save them!</font>

243
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you still alive, Smoker?</font>

244
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law...</font>

245
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way that you would believe
that I'd keep a promise to a pirate like you.</font>

246
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you really wanted to silence me,
then you had plenty of chances to kill me.</font>

247
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you planning on using Straw Hat to do?</font>

248
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use?</font>

249
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's the one being used?</font>

250
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Which of the Four Emperors are you talking about? {copy paste from 594}</i></font>

252
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Kaidou of the Beasts.</i></font>

253
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As long as the first one isn't Shanks, I'm fine with it.</i></font>

254
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Because I plan on defeating all of them!</i></font>

255
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You want to defeat all of them?!</i></font>

256
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>While that may coincide with our goals,
you're underestimating them too much.</i></font>

257
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They are the emperors of this sea,
and battled Whitebeard himself for their turf.</i></font>

258
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Among them, Kaidou of the Beasts
is known as the most powerful creature in the world.</i></font>

259
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!  He's not even human?</i></font>

260
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The purpose of our alliance is to take down Kaidou.</i></font>

261
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The probability of our plan succeeding is...</i></font>

262
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Well, it's best to assume it's extremely low.</i></font>

263
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What, really?!</i></font>

264
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We shouldn't accept his offer, Luffy.</i></font>

265
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I see.</i></font>

266
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,980

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who shouldn't anger him.</font>

395
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think would happen
if he found out you couldn't make Smiles anymore.</font>

396
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't a man you can negotiate with.</font>

397
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There would be a brutal battle.</font>

398
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master, your face...</font>

399
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You would be killed. { def: utterly annihilated }</font>

400
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're taking this joke too far, Law.</font>

401
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do I have to do for you to give back Caesar?</font>

402
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are your demands?</font>

403
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give up your position as a Warlord.</font>

404
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an insolent brat!</font>

405
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we won't be able to stay on Dressrosa!</font>

406
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw away everything you've gained these
past ten years and return to being a normal pirate.</font>

407
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, if you do that
then the Admirals from Navy HQ will hunt you down.</font>

408
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have until tomorrow's morning news.</font>

409
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I see that you've retired from the Warlords then I will contact you again.</font>

410
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there is nothing, then all negotiations are off.</font>

411
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Later.</font>

412
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey wait, Law!</font>

413
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young Master!</font>
