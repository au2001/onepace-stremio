136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great! She turned you back from stone!</font>

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so worried because you
suddenly started to vouch for him.</font>

138
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's right.</font>

139
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was afraid of what would happen to you.</font>

140
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turned us back?</font>

141
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to us?</font>

142
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have absolutely no recollection.</font>

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you remember?</font>

144
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No I don't...</font>

145
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next thing I knew, that man
was there and he was really happy.</font>

146
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'm so relieved!</font>

147
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was worried that you were going to die.</font>

148
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one's here...</font>

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it all finished now?</font>

150
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...And that was it.</font>

151
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like your memory from right before and after you were turned to stone is gone.</font>

152
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll tell you what happened after that.</font>

153
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marguerite.</font>

154
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to the man?</font>

155
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about Snake Princess?</font>

156
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did she turn him to stone this time?</font>

157
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know that much,</font>

158
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it seems like he got
summoned to the Kuja Castle.</font>

159
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

160
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Amazon Lily,
Kuja Castle</font>

161
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I want to know!
What do you want from me?</font>

162
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!</font>

163
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there a meal after the battle?</font>

164
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's what it is, I'll be happy!</font>

165
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:21,980
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Princess's Hall</font>

166
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really need to thank you...</font>

167
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have our gratitude.</font>

168
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah, it's fine.</font>

169
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like I can eat your gratitude.</font>

170
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anybody had seen what's on our backs,</font>

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there is no way that we
could stay in this country.</font>

172
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may come in.</font>

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come inside, Man.</font>

174
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside?</font>

175
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside of the curtain.</font>

176
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, is that where the food is?</font>

177
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming...</font>

178
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, we're not eating.</font>

179
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are you doing
with your clothes off?</font>

180
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always, you are reacting rudely.</font>

181
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very well...</font>

182
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the mark...</font>

183
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that you said...</font>

184
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you had seen somewhere.</font>

185
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a good look at it, again.</font>

186
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you see this?</font>

187
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know the meaning of this mark?</font>

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me, now!</font>

189
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not something I want to show people.</font>

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I suspected, it's a bit different
from what I've seen before.</font>

191
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a friend called Hachi
who is a fish-man...</font>

192
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he has a similar mark on his forehead so I thought it was the same.</font>

193
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know anything about your mark.</font>

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he doesn't know, why don't you tell him?</font>

195
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon!</font>

196
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you come in from?</font>

197
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be honest, Snake Princess.</font>

198
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have seen clearly
how tolerant that man is.</font>

199
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be afraid.</font>

200
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell him everything that you want to share.</font>

201
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

202
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are a pirate,
Monkey D. Luffy, am I right?</font>

203
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I am.</font>

204
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you know about me?</font>

205
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you be so casual after you caused such a sensation in the world?</font>

206
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this newspaper!</font>

207
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just the other day,</font>

208
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">on the Sabaody Archipelago, close to the world's Center of Power,</font>

209
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this man attacked a Celestial Dragon!</font>

210
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's an act that only one who does not fear the wrath of gods would perform!</font>

211
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Celestial Dragon?!</font>

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In response to this, the government dispatched their greatest military forces, but he miraculously escaped.</font>

213
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that incident,</font>

214
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he somehow made it to our distant kingdom in a mere two days!</font>

215
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all beyond our understanding.</font>

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you, I was sent flying all of a sudden!</font>

217
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea where this place is!</font>

218
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I don't regret attacking that Celestial Dragon.</font>

219
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know that bastard did to my friends?</font>

220
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, that means...</font>

221
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really did stand up to the Celestial Dragons?</font>

222
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So...</font>

223
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such a fool...</font>

224
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">still existed in this world?</font>

225
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone who would defy the heavens with no regard for his own life...</font>

226
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just like he did!</font>

227
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you talking about?</font>

228
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will tell you everything...</font>

229
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the meaning behind the symbol branded into your friend's forehead.</font>

230
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi's mark?</font>

231
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is...</font>

232
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Hoof of the Dragon Galloping Across the Heavens...</font>

233
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crest of the Celestial Dragons!</font>

234
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is burned onto the flesh of those bought by the World Nobles.</font>

235
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is a symbol that will never disappear, forever marking the bearer as less than human!</font>

236
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Celestial Dragons?</font>

237
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We three sisters...</font>

238
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were once...</font>

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">slaves of the World Nobles!</font>

240
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were... slaves?!</font>

241
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It happened when I was twelve years old...</font>

242
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet you're hungry! I brought a snack!</font>

243
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hancock?</font>

244
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sonia! Mari! Where are you?</font>

245
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three of us were taken
from the Kuja pirate ship...</font>

246
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...and we were sold!</font>

247
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything after that...</font>

248
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is a disgusting past which I do not wish to be reminded of.</font>

249
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The first men I ever saw in my life were a terrifying crowd...</font>

250
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sister Sonia, calm down!</font>

251
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The memories haunts us...</font>

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wow! H-Hey! That's enough!</font>

253
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't force yourselves! You don't have to tell me!</font>

254
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was awful.</font>

255
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was no hope.</font>

256
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We kept thinking about death!</font>

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! You...</font>

258
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

259
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...one night four years later,</font>

260
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">something happened that made
the World Government tremble.</font>

261
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody dared stand against the Celestial Dragons.</font>

262
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was an undisputed law.</font>

263
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then came a man who climbed the Red Line bare-handed,</font>

264
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and snuck into the Holy Land Mariejoa, home of the Celestial Dragons.</font>

265
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was an adventurer who would one day come to command an entire crew of fishman pirates...</font>

266
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger.</font>

267
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He entered the city responsible for so much cruelty towards his fellow fishmen,</font>

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and razed it to the ground in order to free the fishman slaves.</font>

269
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are free! We are free!</font>

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He disliked humans as a species</font>

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he was being fair to all slaves,</font>

272
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and let thousands of slaves
of different species go free.</font>

273
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We prepared to die and ran among the others.</font>

274
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We owe him an immeasurable debt.</font>

275
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tiger released many fish-men to the sea,</font>

276
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but ones who were slaves had
a mark that cannot be erased.</font>

277
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tiger has made the World Government his enemy</font>

278
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he formed the
Sun Pirates with former slaves</font>

279
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and sailed out into the open sea.</font>

280
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As though breaking a curse,</font>

281
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he changed the Celestial Dragon's
emblem on everyone's bodies...</font>

282
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...into the symbol of the sun.</font>

283
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you thought was similar
to the mark on my back is</font>

284
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the sun symbol of the Sun Pirates.</font>

285
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you're right.</font>

286
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one Hachi has on his
forehead looks like the sun.</font>

287
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean he was a slave, too?</font>

288
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't necessarily mean that he was.</font>

289
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mark is made in such a way
that it is impossible to tell...</font>

290
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...whether they are former slaves or not.</font>

291
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty sure that he once was
a member of the Sun Pirates.</font>

292
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In fact, Fisher Tiger is already dead and...</font>

293
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...the Sun Pirates have split
up into several groups.</font>

294
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess Hachi has led a complicated life, too...</font>

295
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is the reason
that the mark on our backs</font>

296
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is similar to the fish-men's mark.</font>

297
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I pretty much understand.</font>

298
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ironically, the Devil Fruits we were given as slaves to entertain our masters,</font>

299
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Love Fruit and the Snake Fruits,</font>

300
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were what made it possible for us to deceive the country and protect our secret.</font>

301
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you didn't cover up
Sonia's back at that moment,</font>

302
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it would have been impossible
for us to stay on this island.</font>

303
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to let anyone
know about our past!</font>

304
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it means deceiving the entire kingdom...</font>

305
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must never let our guard down for as long as we live!</font>

306
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will never be slaves again!</font>

307
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The idea of being at someone else's mercy...</font>

308
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is too frightening for me to endure...!</font>

309
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Sister...</font>

310
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ho!</font>

311
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is the first time in a long time</font>

312
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since you were this sincere about your own feelings.</font>

313
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was actually wondering if your heart had turned to ice by now.</font>

314
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be silent, you traitor who abandoned the kingdom!</font>

315
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the one who should be silent!</font>

316
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After you had been freed from the Celestial Dragons,</font>

317
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you were just a defenseless little girl...</font>

318
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wandering around, and not knowing how to return to the island!</font>

319
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who do you think it was who brought you all the way back here?!</font>

320
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be thankful that
I was living outside of this country!</font>

321
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You try to change my mind because of such a small debt?</font>

322
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?!</font>

323
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon...</font>

324
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always keep an eye on
you three as a mother would!</font>

325
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you...</font>

326
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">hate me, now that you know that I was a slave?</font>

327
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you, I hate the Celestial Dragons!</font>

328
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've taken a liking to you!</font>

329
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you say that you had one more wish?</font>

330
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

331
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where do you want to go?
I'll give you a ride!</font>

332
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For real?!</font>

333
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Departure will be tomorrow morning.</font>

334
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kuja Pirates will give you a
ride to the Sabaody Archipelago.</font>

335
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--What?! By our pirate ship?
--Sorry to be a pain!</font>

336
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rest well tonight to prepare for tomorrow.</font>

337
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait to get off this island tomorrow!</font>

338
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can't you get it? It's like this!</font>

339
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like this! This!</font>

340
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This!</font>

341
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it like this?</font>

342
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so funny, Luffy-sama!</font>

343
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men stick chopsticks in their nasal cavities
to their mouth</font>

344
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and hold baskets in their hand...</font>

345
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a classless dance!</font>

346
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber... Belly-talk!</font>

347
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the specialty of Maiden Island!</font>

348
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Specialty?</font>

349
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Penne gorgonzola with Sea King meat.</font>

350
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I often eat Sea King meat
but this is different!</font>

351
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really does stretch!</font>

352
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's soft like gum!</font>

353
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your time's up!</font>

354
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--What? One more time!
--No, then you won't stop!</font>

355
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, this Sea King meat is
very good! It's hard to eat...</font>

356
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-W-What are you doing - picking
and stretching my body?!</font>

357
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't help it! You'll
leave tomorrow, right?</font>

358
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are a lot of people who
want to touch you just one time.</font>

359
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See!</font>

360
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>"20 gol per touch"</i></font>

361
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--You're so popular!
--Luffy-chan!</font>

362
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't do business using
me without asking me!!</font>

363
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, Luffy-chan! Tonight is
our only chance to touch a man!</font>

364
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! S-Stop, you people!
I can't eat! Hey! Hey!</font>

365
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Marguerite?</font>

366
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Where did Luffy-sama go?
--No! He ran away!</font>

367
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't have gotten too far!
Let's find him and touch him!</font>

368
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter with them?</font>

369
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep hiding!</font>

370
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the only food that I could bring.</font>

371
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's great that you can
return to your friends!</font>

372
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that
I got you into some trouble.</font>

373
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I worried when you turned into stone!</font>

374
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you protected us, right?</font>

375
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard what happened.</font>

376
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Luffy!</font>

377
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter, Marguerite?</font>

378
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's been chased by girls of the village.</font>

379
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder. They don't see men often.</font>

380
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Granny Bean!</font>

381
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This part of the village is
secluded. Stay here for a while.</font>

382
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And my name's not Bean!!</font>

383
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has something to eat, so just
bring him tea or something.</font>

384
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

385
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny, you like to read newspapers, huh?</font>

386
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The News Coos don't deliver to the Calm Belt,</font>

387
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so it's hard to get these.</font>

388
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The empress of this kingdom is a Warlord of the Sea,</font>

389
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to know what's going
on in the world at least.</font>

390
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's a Warlord of the Sea?</font>

391
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess.</font>

392
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

393
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's a Warlord of the Sea?</font>

394
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean she's
really strong in a fight?</font>

395
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are a pirate.
Didn't you notice it?</font>

396
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, I didn't.</font>

397
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you read newspapers?</font>

398
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I don't read them.</font>

399
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, what a shock!</font>

400
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess became
empress of this country</font>

401
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and a captain of the
Kuja Pirates 11 years ago.</font>

402
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was still so young, but after just one voyage, a bounty of 80 million was put on her head.</font>

403
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just one voyage?</font>

404
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It had to do with the bad reputation
Kuja had even before her.</font>

405
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Government became
cautious about her from the start</font>

406
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and they suggested that she become
one of the Seven Warlords.</font>

407
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But now, that title is about to be revoked.</font>

408
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?!</font>

409
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Seven Warlords and Navy Headquarters</font>

410
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are gonna fight
the Whitebeard Pirates?!</font>

411
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?! What'll happen?!
W-W-W-W-Wait a minute!</font>

412
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is too much to hear at once!</font>

413
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a foolish man!
You don't know anything.</font>

414
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must say, that was just a prediction.</font>

415
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the battle will probably happen.</font>

416
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Government has made a move.</font>

417
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard is a man who would never
allow his mates to be killed.</font>

418
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though they know this, they
announced the public execution of...</font>

419
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Portgas D. Ace, a great
commander of Whitebeard's.</font>

420
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of who?</font>

421
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace. "Fire Fist" Ace.</font>

422
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

423
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace... is gonna get executed?</font>

424
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard a pirate called Blackbeard...</font>

425
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...became a Warlord of the Sea by
defeating "Fire Fist" Ace.</font>

426
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard...</font>

427
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Government will take full
advantage of this big fish they've caught,</font>

428
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a pirate named Ace...</font>

429
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Granny...</font>

430
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny!!</font>

431
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's my brother!</font>

432
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace is my older brother!</font>

433
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

434
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that true?! He's your brother?!</font>

435
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know that he was captured.</font>

436
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's gonna be executed?!
Then, there's no chance for him to escape!</font>

437
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Whitebeard wins this battle,
there will be a chance for him.</font>

438
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do? Where are
they gonna execute him?</font>

439
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll take place Marinford's town square,</font>

440
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">where Navy Headquarters stands.</font>

441
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It says "in one week," which
means 6 days from today.</font>

442
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! That's too soon!</font>

443
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long will it take to get to
Sabaody Archipelago from here?</font>

444
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will take more than a week.</font>

445
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it takes that long, then Ace will
be finished before I meet my crew!</font>

446
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then how long will it take
to get to where Ace is?</font>

447
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impel Down is where he locked, and
it'll take a week by a pirate ship</font>

448
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and 4 days by a navy ship.</font>

449
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?! Navy ships are that fast?</font>

450
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a current used exclusively
by the World Government.</font>

451
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enies Lobby.</font>

452
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impel Down.</font>

453
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Navy Headquarters.</font>

454
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a giant whirlpool which
connects those three facilities.</font>

455
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When you open the Gate of Justice
at any of the three facilities,</font>

456
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the current runs inside
allowing you to enter.</font>

457
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means if the gates aren't open,
you'd just keep drifting on the current.</font>

458
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirate ships would rather avoid the current by going a long way round.</font>

459
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?</font>

460
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want to do?</font>

461
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me that's your
brother's Vivre Card!</font>

462
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, is it the sheet that moves
around that you care about so much?</font>

463
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a different one.</font>

464
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the one that Ace gave to me.</font>

465
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's also known as a paper of life.</font>

466
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It tells you a direction in which the
person is and about their vital energy.</font>

467
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, if it's that small, it means...</font>

468
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I got it, it was ten times bigger.</font>

469
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace has his own adventure...</font>

470
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's natural for a big brother to worry about...</font>

471
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">his bungling kid brother.</font>

472
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace won't like me rescuing him
since he's stronger.</font>

473
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

474
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, everybody.</font>

475
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna take a little side trip.</font>

476
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go and rescue Ace!</font>

477
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:21,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have any idea how reckless it would be and how big this battle is going to be?</font>

478
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll be like an ant blown into a storm.</font>

479
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can just be flicked away
without even having done anything.</font>

480
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care what's gonna
happen! I just wanna go!</font>

481
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't just sit by calmly on the
sidelines and let this happen!</font>

482
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

483
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're going to rescue the most
infamous prisoner in the world now.</font>

484
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there is a chance in a million,</font>

485
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you better go to the Great
Prison where he's being held.</font>

486
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When they move him to the
execution ground in Marinford,</font>

487
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the navy admirals and the Seven
Warlords will be keeping a close eye.</font>

488
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, because your brother is now
the most important prisoner they have,</font>

489
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there is no doubt that they're guarding the
prison with the military's full strength.</font>

490
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's impossible to enter.</font>

491
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I care more about getting there in
time than what happens after.</font>

492
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got to get there while Ace is there.</font>

493
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give me a big oar,
and I'll paddle myself...</font>

494
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second! You can't
get there on will alone.</font>

495
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a slim chance, too, but...</font>

496
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess refuses to follow the order to
force the Seven Warlords to assemble.</font>

497
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only she obeys the order,</font>

498
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we can take advantage of it
and let you on their ship.</font>

499
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their ship? There's a navy ship here?!</font>

500
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'm gonna go and ask her!</font>

501
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,320
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Amazon Lily
Kuja Castle</font>

502
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon!</font>

503
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Enishida? Why
are you in such a hurry?</font>

504
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank god. I was going to come get you.</font>

505
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

506
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

507
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess...</font>

508
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has come down with an unknown illness.</font>

509
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--She's sick?!
--Oh my god!</font>

510
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Sis! Hang in there!</font>

511
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Sis!</font>

512
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Granny Nyon!</font>

513
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, wait outside for a while.</font>

514
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! But I have to hurry!</font>

515
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that!</font>

516
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't breathe.</font>

517
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way she's clutching her chest,</font>

518
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think there's something
wrong with her heart.</font>

519
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I can't figure out what it is.</font>

520
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen symptoms like these, so
I don't know what to prescribe.</font>

521
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess seems to be in a lot of pain.</font>

522
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She didn't eat a thing.</font>

523
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tomorrow morning...</font>

524
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Snake Princess!
--Granny Nyon, stop fooling around with her!</font>

525
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

526
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe this!</font>

527
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an untimely virus!</font>

528
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--A virus?
--Do you know what it is?</font>

529
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon... I can't breathe!</font>

530
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I... going to die?</font>

531
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, you are.</font>

532
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--What're you saying?!
--Stop making stupid jokes, Granny Nyon!</font>

533
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The former empress died
from the same illness.</font>

534
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard the empress before
that died from this, too.</font>

535
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:22,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I caught it, too, but left this country and survived.</font>

536
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess, Monkey D. Luffy is here with me.</font>

537
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Granny Nyon!</font>

538
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wants to ask you a favor.
Can you at least listen to him?</font>

539
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Big Sis is suffering!
--What are you thinking?!</font>

540
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's standing!</font>

541
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright. I'd like to hear it.</font>

542
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How lucky he is, Monkey D. Luffy!</font>

543
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will he move this mountain
that no one could move?!</font>

544
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you want something? Luffy?</font>

545
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gotta ask you something!</font>

546
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alright?</font>

547
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No sickness can overtake me.</font>

548
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:17,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a Whitebeard pirate named Ace who's
waiting to be executed. He's my brother!</font>

549
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to rescue Ace!</font>

550
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I heard a pirate ship
can't make it in time!</font>

551
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:27,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you board the navy ship and take me to Ace's prison?!</font>

552
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How self-centered can
you be? Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

553
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know Big Sis's pain but you still
ask her to go to that abhorrent place?!</font>

554
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How cruel you are!</font>

555
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We showed you mercy and then you become arrogant!</font>

556
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is why we hate men! Big Sis's
patience is wearing very thin!</font>

557
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn him to stone and
throw him over the edge!</font>

558
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you want me to follow their order for
the Seven Warlords to convene.</font>

559
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Big Sis!
--Kill him!</font>

560
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want me to...</font>

561
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go anywhere!</font>

562
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good! Thank you! This way I can
make it before the execution!</font>

563
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Snake Princess decided to
go to the World Government HQ!</font>

564
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to her, Granny Nyon?!</font>

565
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess is
suffering from love sickness!</font>

566
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The former empresses died
from being burnt by love!</font>

567
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a saying around the East Blue:</font>

568
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Love is always..."</font>

569
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"...a hurricane!"</font>
