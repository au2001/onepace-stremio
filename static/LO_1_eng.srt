00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's known as the Town of
Beginnings and Endings.</font>

124
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Its reputation precedes itself.</font>

125
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,
was born and executed in that town.</font>

126
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The town where the King
of the Pirates died...</font>

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! I have to see it!</font>

during this age of piracy!</font>

135
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The weak and the feeble are not
to blame! They will have justice!</font>

136
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If evil persists upon the seas,</font>

137
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">then we Marines must drive it
away with the utmost of force!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In the name of absolute justice!</font>

141
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wow! What a huge town!</font>

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The place used to be full of pirates
on their way to the Grand Line.</font>

good ingredients here.</font>

147

148
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,030

151
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright! I'm gonna check
out the execution platform!</font>

152

153
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna see where
the King of the Pirates was executed!</font>

where we're meeting up yet!</font>

I work for the Marines?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well... now what?</font>

254
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What happened here?!</font>

255
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It seems someone attacked them!
There's no trace of the assailant!</font>

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit! She looks
way too much like Kuina!</font>

259
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Not to mention
she's a swordsman, too...</font>

260
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The world sure is a big place,
but I doubt I'll ever see her again.</font>

261
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'd like some swords.</font>

291
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,300

292
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thank goodness! You're all right!</font>

293
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Someone went on a rampage
at the Marine outpost earlier.</font>

294
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You went missing, so I was worried!</font>

295
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How dense can she be?</font>

296
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">Thank goodness! What a relief...</font>

297
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But the fact that you're
here, safe and sound...</font>

298
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">means you must have scoffed
at my kind offer and ran off!</font>

299
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Here, take your money back.</font>

300
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't accept money
from someone that cold.</font>

301
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Besides, I already bought
some new glasses!</font>

302
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't tell me this sword
is <i>the</i> Wado Ichimonji!</font>

303
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It <i>has</i> to be the Wado Ichimonji!</font>

304
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wado...?</font>

305
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't say it! Don't say it!</font>

306
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A beautiful straight temper line!</font>

307
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I believe it's one of the
twenty-one great grade swords!</font>

308
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">See! Look at this! It's worth
no less than 10 million belly!</font>

309
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But how did <i>you</i> come
across a named blade?</font>

310
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Dammit! You just <i>had</i> to go
and run your mouth!</font>

311
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll sue for obstruction of business!</font>

312
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">O-Obstruction of business?</font>

313
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm sorry! Did I say something wrong?</font>

314
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're here for Shigure, right?!</font>

315
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm done polishing it!
Take it and get the hell out!</font>

316
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why did you run straight into those?!</font>

317
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I'm sorry.</font>

318
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That klutz saved you!</font>

319
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Really though, a named blade
is wasted on a guy who</font>

320
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">wields it without knowing its value.</font>

321
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All the swords in that barrel
are 50,000 belly apiece!</font>

322
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just pick whatever two you want!</font>

323
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's he so mad about?</font>

324
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You must really like swords
to want to carry three of them!</font>

325
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It reminds me of that
one bounty hunter!</font>

326
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A bounty hunter?</font>

327
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's very well-known.
His name is Roronoa.</font>

328
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I hear that name a lot.</font>

329
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes, he's known all
throughout the East Blue...</font>

330
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but he's a demon!</font>

331
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Using swords to hunt
bounties is unforgivable!</font>

332
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why has evil grown strong in this era?</font>

333
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">All the famous sword masters
are pirates or bounty hunters...</font>

334
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And they possess the majority
of the world's named blades.</font>

335
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's a real shame...</font>

336
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well, everyone has their own
set of circumstances, right?</font>

337
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Every profession has to
keep up with the times somehow...</font>

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In any case, with my Shigure,</font>

339
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm going to hone my swordsmanship</font>

340
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and someday I'll retrieve all the named
blades from the criminals of the world!</font>

341
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The twelve supreme grade swords,
the twenty-one great grade swords,</font>

342
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and the fifty fine grade swords...
I'll risk my life for them!</font>

343
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You gonna take <i>this</i> sword, too?</font>

344
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The Wado Ichimonji, was it?</font>

345
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That is... It's not that I want
the named blades for myself.</font>

346
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm just saying I don't want
criminals to wield them!</font>

347
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This sword...</font>

348
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That sword! I think it's...</font>

349
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I thought so! Kitetsu III!</font>

350
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's the Kitetsu III!</font>

351
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Its predecessor, the Kitetsu II,
is a great grade sword,</font>

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and the Kitetsu I before that is
listed as a supreme grade sword!</font>

353
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Mister! Is this sword
really only 50,000 belly?!</font>

354
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yeah...</font>

355
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Incredible! The grade of this
sword is very respectable!</font>

356
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That one! You <i>have</i> to buy that one!</font>

357
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It normally goes for one million belly!</font>

358
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's an absolute no-brainer!</font>

359
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">N-No! I can't sell it!</font>

360
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Well, sure! Selling this for 50,000
belly would be extremely odd!</font>

361
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No, that's not it...!</font>

362
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A cursed sword, huh?</font>

363
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You knew?!</font>

364
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No. I can just tell.</font>

365
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">From their first incarnation,</font>

366
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">every Kitetsu has been outstanding,
but each of them carries a curse!</font>

367
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Many famous master swordsmen</font>

368
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">have met tragic deaths after
taking up Kitetsu swords.</font>

369
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nowadays, you won't find a single
person willing to use a Kitetsu</font>

370
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">because they'll take you from this world
even if you use one unknowingly!</font>

371
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I just wanna get rid of the thing,
but I'm afraid it'll curse me...</font>

372
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I'm sorry! I had no idea it was
such a terrifying sword!</font>

373
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I should've minded my own business!</font>

374
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I like it! I'll take it!</font>

375
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A-Are you a moron?! I can't sell it!</font>

376
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you die because of it,
then it'd be like I killed you myself!</font>

377
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>You're</i> the moron! Just get the sale!</font>

378
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Honey!</font>

379
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then let's do this.</font>

380
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My luck, or this thing's curse?</font>

381
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll find out which is stronger.</font>

382
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can't...!</font>

383
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Stop! It's sharp enough
to take your arm off!</font>

384
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll take it.</font>

385
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey. Could you pick
another one for me?</font>

386
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">S-Sure...</font>

387
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-Hold it!</font>

388
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">With a black lacquered sheath...</font>

389
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and its blade's uneven
temper pattern...</font>

390
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The fine grade sword Yubashiri!</font>

391
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My shop may not be much,
but this is the finest sword I own!</font>

392
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't afford it. I already
told you, I got no money.</font>

393
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Forget the money. And I don't
need any for the Kitetsu, either.</font>

394
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm sorry for trying
to cheat you earlier.</font>

395
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I've not seen the eyes of
a good swordsman in ages.</font>

396
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They say the sword
chooses the owner.</font>

397
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll be praying for your good fortune!</font>

398
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I definitely feel more
at ease with three swords.</font>

399
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, what's this?</font>

400
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hard to believe a miser like you
gave away the family treasure.</font>

401
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Can't a man entrust
another with his dream?</font>

402
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And I dream of you
taking out the trash!</font>

403
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yes, ma'am!</font>

404
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It scared me so much
that I still can't stand up...</font>

405
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's that?</font>

406
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Lemme see.</font>

407
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hawk Eye! What're you doing here?!</font>

408
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Calm down. I have
no qualms with you.</font>

409
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where is your boss?</font>

410
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Camping out on an island like this...
What a carefree man.</font>

411
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">B-B-Boss!</font>

412
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I-It's Hawk Eye!</font>

413
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey there, Hawk Eye.
This is unexpected...</font>

414
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm not feeling my best right now...
Have you come looking to fight?</font>

415
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I have no intention of
settling our grievances...</font>

416
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">now that you're missing your left arm.</font>

417
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I encountered an interesting pirate...</font>

418
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and was suddenly reminded
of a story you used to tell.</font>

419
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A story about an interesting boy
from a certain small village...</font>

420
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You don't mean...!</font>

421
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So you've made it, Luffy!</font>

422
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,440
<font face="Roboto" size="44"><b><font size="25">Captain "Red-Haired" Shanks
Red Hair Pirates</font></b></font>

423
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">In that case, Hawk Eye...</font>

424
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't just let you leave now.</font>

425
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That so, Hawk Eye?!</font>

426
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Okay! Drink up! Drink up!
Today's a celebration!</font>

427
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Did you not have a hangover?</font>

428
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't sweat it! It's a celebratory drink!</font>

429
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">C'mon, now! C'mon, now!</font>

430
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just gulp it straight down!</font>

431
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You ain't half bad!
Let's drink! Let's drink!</font>

432
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah!</font>

433
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But, wait! Boss!</font>

434
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You said you felt sick 'cause
you drank too much before!</font>

435
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You dolt! How could I <i>not</i> drink
on a joyous day like today!</font>

436
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The sun's still up.</font>

437
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't sweat it!</font>

438
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's throw a party!</font>

439
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! Luffy's a wanted man now!</font>

440
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Good for him!</font>

441
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y'know, this village might just
produce a great pirate!</font>

442
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That'd be great!</font>

443
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Quiet, you knuckleheads!</font>

444
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Mr. Mayor!</font>

445
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's so good about a criminal
coming from our village?!</font>

446
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A toast!</font>

447
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Honestly! Every last one of them...!</font>

448
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Come on, Mayor!
Luffy looks so happy here!</font>

449
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A pirate's a pirate!</font>

450
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!</i></font>

451
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sure, but it's his dream.
Does that worry you?</font>

452
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">His dream... or fate?</font>
