00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Tank!</font>

133
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over 100 competitors have been eliminated,</font>

134
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and there are only 30 some men left in the ring!</font>

135
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be much longer.</font>

136
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter how tough the remaining one will be as long as we have the King Punch...</font>

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's next?!</font>

138
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to bleed, come out!</font>

139
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tank Lepanto was taken out</font>

140
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by the evil combination of Abdullah and Jeet.</font>

141
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bellamy!</font>

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Atrocious"! "Evil"!</font>

143
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those are the only words fitting to this man!</font>

144
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the meantime, the Jiaokungdo martial artist, Blue Gilly</font>

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the mysterious gladiator, Ricky</font>

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are fighting each other with all they have!</font>

147
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Fish-Man is so strong!</font>

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been knocking out all of his opponents with a single blow!</font>

149
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's so cool!</font>

150
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so excited!</font>

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop him!</font>

152
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!</font>

153
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much more does Bartolomeo want to offend these people?!</font>

154
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is nobody kicking his ass?!</font>

155
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In front of this huge audience,</font>

156
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he pulled <i>it</i> out and started peeing!</font>

157
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one has ever done such a thing in this Colosseum!</font>

158
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels so good!</font>

159
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, stop him!</font>

160
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here comes that somebody!</font>

161
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some of us are taking this thing seriously, brat!</font>

162
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

163
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll have to excuse me for attacking you from behind!</font>

164
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait! I'm defenseless!</font>

165
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hero who came in to punish him is the Fish-Man warrior, Hack!</font>

166
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Four Thousand Tile...</font>

167
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it! Kick his ass, Hack!</font>

168
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Punch!</font>

169
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Psyche!</font>

170
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did he do?! Hack is the one on the ground?</font>

171
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

172
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?</font>

173
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Who the hell are you?!</font>

174
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartolomeo!</font>

175
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hack was defeated!</font>

176
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was beaten without even landing a punch!</font>

177
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did Bartolomeo do to him?!</font>

178
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! I was rooting for Hack! That bird brain!</font>

179
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatz-san, you're supposed to be unbiased!</font>

180
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is still no clear winner!</font>

181
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">24 competitors remain in B Block.</font>

182
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's winding down, huh?</font>

183
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such cheek...</font>

184
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost everybody has wounds of some kind!</font>

185
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's about time!</i></font>

186
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Powerful competitors are getting eliminated too, one after another!</font>

187
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Following Hack, the unknown gladiator, Ricky, has also got taken down!</font>

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blue Gilly is strong!</font>

189
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blue Gilly-sama!</font>

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think you're going to cut with that sword, old man?</font>

191
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I guess you can't fight against age.</i></font>

192
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't stand all this cheering.</i></font>

193
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I can't stand you, Doflamingo!</i></font>

194
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There aren't that many men left thanks to Dagama's tactics!</font>

195
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Dagama gives us the cue, we'll disband.</font>

196
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we'll fight amongst ourselves until one of us wins.</font>

197
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men! Take care of Blue Gilly while we're fighting together!</font>

198
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dagama?!</font>

200
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did a fine job, you stupid dogs!</font>

201
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

202
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you haven't given us the cue!</font>

203
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me... Dagama!</font>

204
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two!</font>

205
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry! I've been told to hunt you dogs!</font>

206
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you plotting together...</font>

207
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To get rid of us from the beginning?</font>

208
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will pay you later! Your job is done now!</font>

209
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dagama!</font>

210
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warriors who can't use their brains just end up as pawns on a battlefield!</font>

211
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be counting on you, Longleg man!</font>

212
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Now that you turned your back to me, you're dead too.</i></font>

213
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Blue Gilly.</i></font>

214
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

215
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You betrayed me, Blue Gilly!</font>

216
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dagama the tactician was eliminated!</font>

217
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Way to go, Longleg guy!</font>

218
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blue Gilly-sama!</font>

219
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe people would trust a
dubious guy like him in the first place.</font>

220
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this? Meanwhile, on the other side...</font>

221
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bellamy went in for the attack but ended up on the ground!</font>

222
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did Bartolomeo do?!</font>

223
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't believe it!</font>

224
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our Bellamy is barely breathing!</font>

225
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What devil fruit did he eat?!</font>

226
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bellamy...</font>

227
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like with Hack! Bellamy took damage from his own attack!</font>

228
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did he do to him?</font>

229
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Bellamy! Don't give up!</font>

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now what are you gonna do, Elizabello?</font>

231
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing is more helpless than a king without his court.</font>

232
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone's dying to take your head.</font>

233
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dagama did a great job.</font>

234
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The time has come.</font>

235
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All that is left is to throw it!</font>

236
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are the ones who were protected while we were in that battle formation.</font>

237
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because nothing is more dangerous than an exposed blade.</font>

238
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that right, punk?</font>

239
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I just thought of something.</font>

240
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

241
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was a report about the king of Prodence.</font>

242
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They said he destroyed an enemy country's fort with a single punch.</font>

243
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! He must've used some kind of weapon.</font>

244
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, they say it could even take out one of the Four Emperors.</font>

245
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

246
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's true, everything in front of him,</font>

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">including these seats will get destroyed!</font>

248
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

249
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! That can't be true!</font>

250
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard those reports too!</font>

251
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! He wouldn't throw such a dangerous thing at a place like this!</font>

252
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a restlessness in the air!</font>

253
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The king who kept quiet in the battle formation is now on the move!</font>

254
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We of the Prodence Kingdom will be taking the Flame Fruit!</font>

255
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a terrible feeling about this!</font>

256
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got to be kidding!</font>

257
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa-whoa, this is bad!</font>

258
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

259
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe he really did destroy the fort!</font>

260
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so persistent! What are you doing?! Get off me!</font>

261
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! Don't underestimate the power of my spring!</font>

262
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="75" color="#f9ca71">King...</font>

263
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kill Elizabello!</font>

264
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Outta my way!</font>
