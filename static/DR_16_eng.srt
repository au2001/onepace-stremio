00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what happened.</font>

50
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a moment.</font>

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, explain it to us!</font>

52
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

53
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law-dono has been shot by Doflamingo right before our eyes.{I'm not so sure about the word "defeated" here... I mean yeah, WE know he's not dead, and Luffy confirms he's not dead later, but this word could just as easily be interpreted as "killed"... and really, that seems to fit better with both how seriously Kin is taking it, and how the others react... -Starfish}{Isis: okay, so I didn't get what Starfish was trying to say here, but just in case he wasn't satisfied with the word "defeated" then how about using "shot" instead, it might be more fitting to what he wants to deliver to the viewers}</font>

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you hear that?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw a kid that looks like Momonosuke on the ship just earlier.</font>

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let him get to you.</font>

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let him have Momo.</font>

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That goes without being said.</font>

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!{Isis: I used the SD.mkv workraw and it just stops working right after Luffy says Zoro and til Kin'emon's line "Zoro-dono has disappeared." also on a second note, the video seems to be in sync with the audio just fine using other players, but when working with Aegisub it's not the case after this line anymore}</font>

63
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-dono.</font>

64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to Zoro, Kin'emon?!</font>

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-dono has disappeared.</font>

67

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm coming now!</font>

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, these were made of Sea Stone.</font>

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kin'emon-san, are you okay?</font>

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You haven't been killed, have you?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This one's{aka, Zoro. Not the attack he used -Starfish} quite strong.</font>

74
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the blind old gambling man was a Navy Admiral. How about that.</font>

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Admiral?!</font>

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thank you for before.</font>

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you all helped me out,</font>

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it seems I'm repaying you with ingratitude.</font>

79
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This job often brings bad karma. {This is ugly, editor please fix this. "inga" means karma, and "tosei" means livlyhood or occupation. So he's talking about how his job as a marine has brought about this karmic situation.}</font>

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, the man with Doflamingo is...</font>

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a... a Navy Admiral!</font>

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An Admiral is on Dressrosa right now?</font>

83
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's possible that Doflamingo has allied with the Navy.</font>

84
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that's the case, then the number of enemies we'll be facing is unknown.</font>

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law-dono! Law-dono!</font>

86
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How are they both flying?!</font>

87
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you still alive? Answer me!</font>

88
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll continue our talk at the palace, Fujitora.</font>

89
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you cooperate with me, I'll give you the heads of those brats.</font>

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll hear you out, Heavenly Demon.</font>

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But <i>I'll</i> decide what to do after that.</font>

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capture Roronoa Zoro!</font>

93
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like they know who we are.</font>

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it would seem.</font>

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So for now, let's run!</font>

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Traf!</font>

97
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Kin'emon, Law-dono has been taken by them! {EEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH???}</font>

98
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Luffy, hurry and find an exit!</font>

99
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll keep running around here and wait for you!</font>

100
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'll hurry.</font>

101
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can still sense Traf{Referring to how he can still sense his thoughts and stuff with his Haki -Starfish}.  He's alive.</font>

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Brook and the others.</font>

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on now?</font>

104
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-T-T-This...</font>

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on on the Sunny?</font>

106
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were behind us!</font>

107
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, they found us.</font>

108
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Big Mom's... {Considering it says "BIG MOM" on the sail, maybe we should be calling her that?}{Cecil: Obviously that's in japanese, so it translates to Big Mam. (Even though its spelled Mom in american english)}</font>

110
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... pirate ship!</font>

111
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="43">Ship, ship♪</font>

112
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is the ship of one of the Four Emperors doing here?!{No really, am I the only one who thinks that the period is an extremely unfitting form of punctuation when the person speaking is very clearly freaking out?

113
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the prow singing?</font>

114
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

115
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom's ship?!</font>

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna die!</font>

117
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on, is Big Mom on that ship?</font>

118
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know, but those two we met on Fishman Island are onboard.</font>

119
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mama, I've spotted Caesar -gao!</font>

120
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As we thought, he was with them -<i>bon. {Cecil: This is italicized because of how he says it, right? We don't usually italicize speech quirks but I actually like the idea of doing so. But ven you get Charaters vike Ivankov who von't have seperate quirks.}</i></font>

121
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should sink their ship and pull Caesar up -<i>soir.</i></font>

122
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom?!</font>

123
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you so.</font>

124
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is because you picked a fight with her, Luffy!</font>

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,870

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that ship here to save you as well?!</font>

128
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me please!</font>

129
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't let Big Mom capture me!</font>

130
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got my research funds...</font>

131
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by tricking her and ripping her off! {Cecil: I split this from the previous line for dramatic effect, and also padded out this line cause it seemed too short for what he says. Anyway can TLC check that it's still ok and if not, provide a literal trans?}</font>

132
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say?</font>

133
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Well... let's not talk about the details!</font>

134
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway if I'm captured, they'll find out that I've stolen the money and kill me!</font>

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I care about your life!</font>

136
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I can't let them take you anyway, so shut up!</font>

137
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're gonna shoot at us!</font>

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn, we're getting farther away from Dressrosa. They couldn't have picked a worse time to appear!</font>

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you lose them?</font>

140
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay, Sanji?</font>

141
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you dare bring an Emperor to this country.</font>

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This whole country would fall into panic and the soldier's plans will be screwed.</font>

143
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, why is Caesar on the ship?</font>

144
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess negotiations have broken down.</font>

145
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why else would Traf end up like that?</font>

146
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law told us to take Caesar to the next island, that's why he's here.</font>

147
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun, I don't think we should go back to Dressrosa.</font>

148
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not saying this because I'm scared.</font>

149
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, Luffy.</font>

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have three cards that we're competing with Doflamingo for.</font>

151
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar, the Smile factory, and for some reason, Momonosuke. {Cecil: For some reason indeed! WHY?! Cause Doflamingo said his name once and he's as important as Caesar clown or the Smile Factory?!}{Giolla also specifically demanded that they hand Momonosuke over, so it's pretty clear that Doffy sees him as an important part of his plans... for... whatever reason. -Starfish}</font>

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We still haven't destroyed the Smile factory.</font>

153
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we have the other two cards right here.</font>

154
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Traf fought because he was a decoy to lure Doflamingo away from these cards.</font>

155
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He may also be trying to buy time to destroy the factory.</font>

156
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we go there and give up the cards that Traf tried so hard to protect...</font>

157
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All his hard work will be in vain.</font>

158
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

159
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we'll definitely get Traf back!</font>

160
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was the next island called?</font>

161
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's called Zou.</font>

162
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji.</font>

163
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami.</font>

164
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper.</font>

165
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook.</font>

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Momo.</font>

167
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys, go on ahead to Zou.</font>

168
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you say so... Roger, Captain!</font>

169
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'd like your permission for something.</font>

170
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Permission?</font>

171
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Allow me...</font>

172
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to attack Big Mom's ship!</font>

173
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, sure.</font>

174
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're joking.</font>

175
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already picked a fight with her.</font>

176
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got that right.</font>

177
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's too dangerous!</font>

178
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!</font>

179
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we'll be waiting for you guys on Zou.</font>

180
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it.</font>

181
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the destruction of the factory to us!</font>

182
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, be careful.</font>

183
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're heading to the palace.</font>

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna send Doflamingo flying!</font>

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Barrier!</font>

186
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is the meaning of this?!</font>

187
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bartolomeo?</font>

188
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This has nothing to do with you!</font>

189
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True. I just felt like raising this barrier.</font>

190
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a family matter! I'll kill you too!</font>

191
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just try. Nobody can break my barrier.</font>

192
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? I'm busy!</font>

193
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me, Dellinger.</font>

194
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sounds like you still haven't finished off Bellamy.</font>

195
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You slowpoke.</font>

196
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, shut up! Something got in the way.</font>

197
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind, we'll deal with that later.</font>

198
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doffy has a new order for you.</font>

199
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go help Lao G and the others protect the Toys' House. Right now.</font>

200
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Diamante! I'll be done here in a second!</font>

201
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet! Do you plan to disobey Doffy?!</font>

202
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"A new order"?</font>

203
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I...</font>

204
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">really was...</font>

205
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta be kidding...</font>

206
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get real!</font>

207
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way.</font>

208
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going... to kick Bellamy to death!</font>

209
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it!</font>

210
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way. I ain't removing the barrier.</font>

211
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that call just now.</font>

212
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So get out of here!</font>

213
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn barrier-bastard!</font>

214
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get you for this!</font>

215
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not leaving Dressrosa alive!</font>

216
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scram, you little brat!</font>

217
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was Diamante's voice, no doubt about it.</font>

218
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that order was for real?</font>

219
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo really did...</font>

220
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">order my death?</font>

221
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So if I win this tournament, I'll become a commander in the Family? {I THINK this is new dialogue... -Starfish}</i></font>

222
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Of course.</i></font>

223
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Do your best.</i></font>

224
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've got high hopes for you.</i></font>

225
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take you to the medical room.</font>

226
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't need your help!</font>

227
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lost my goal in life.</font>

228
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And anyway, why would you help me?</font>

229
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the battle royale earlier...</font>

230
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was trying to kill all of you guys!</font>

231
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We fought in the same ring!</font>

232
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

233
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When two men have exchanged blows on the battlefield,</font>

234
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that makes them comrades in arms!</font>

235
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd never abandon a comrade, no matter how rotten he may be!</font>

236
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,430
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa "Flower Hill"</font>

237
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The situation is like I explained. {Cecil: I hate redundant lines like this. "Everything is exactly how I just said it is."}</font>

238
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As for our plan to expose the tragedies</font>

239
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,660
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Underground - Riku's Revolutionary Army Base</font>

240
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that have been buried in the darkness,</font>

241
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've given it the following name.</font>

242
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Dressrosa SOP Operation.</font>

243
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">SOP? What's that mean?</font>

244
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a massive underground world in this country.</font>

245
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside is the trade port, for making secret deals,</font>

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as well as the mysterious factory. {Xemnas: The actual wording says "mysterious factory" but I like factory of darkness, and the whole darkness does give the impression of mystery anyway. Just thought I'd mention it.}</font>

247
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our Tontattan friends</font>

248
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,540
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Factory & trade port</font>

249
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and all the people turned into toys</font>

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are being forced to work there.</font>

251
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see! So what does SOP mean?</font>

252
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will break in there using the tunnel we've spent the last year digging,</font>

253
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,200
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Secretly infiltrate
via tunnel</font>

254
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and rescue everyone there!</font>

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we will destroy the facilities, take down the Doflamingo Family, and restore King Riku!</font>

256
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the objective of our plan.</font>

257
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You talk as if it's gonna be easy.</font>

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, the plan is extremely idealistic.</font>

259
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no idea what will happen to Dressrosa in the next few minutes.</font>

260
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First and foremost, there is one mission we absolutely must carry out.</font>

261
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo's subordinate, the one who turned us into toys...</font>

262
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must knock the Hobby Fruit user unconscious!</font>

263
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hobby Fruit?</font>

264
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think will happen then?</font>

265
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will the spell be broken?</font>

266
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! All the toys in Dressrosa...</font>

267
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will return to human form at once!</font>

268
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the same time, the people will regain whatever memories they have lost.</font>

269
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't guess what will happen after that.</font>

270
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:37,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not how many people will fight alongside us, nor what the people will think, nor what actions they'll take.</font>

271
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or what move Doflamingo will make.</font>

272
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What move the Navy will make.</font>

273
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only thing we can say for sure, {Cecil: Does this give any context to the awkwardly edited previous set of lines? I'll fix it up after QC}{Xemnas: Well the next line, line 198 should start here. Fixed it.}</font>

274
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is that panic will erupt throughout the country.</font>

275
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, where is this Hobby Fruit user?</font>

276
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's really strong, right?</font>

277
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">According to the Tontatta reconnaissance unit, {Cecil: didn't we call this the scout unit? I'll check it later}</font>

278
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she's in the trade port right now.</font>

279
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She is a special commander in the Donquixote Family's Trébol Army.</font>

280
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar!</font>

281
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A girl who can turn anyone she touches into a toy.</font>

282
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She looks like a child, because whoever eats this fruit stops aging once they do.</font>

283
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She is regarded as one of Doflamingo's most valuable subordinates, {I'm a little confused about this line because it looks like way more text than belongs here, and I don't hear a "Doflamingo", but this is the only place I can see it going}{Xemnas: It's good as is.}</font>

284
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so one of his top commanders, Trébol, is guarding her at all times. {Cecil: I'd like to say executives here, since he's a rank above sugar who was also just referred to as commander.}{Xemnas: You could, how have we referred to them in the past?}</font>

285
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if we can just make her fall unconscious, the toys will return to normal?</font>

286
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!</font>

287
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will scare Sugar half to death and make her faint.</font>

288
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the...</font>

289
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar</font>

290
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar Oversurprise</font>

291
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar Oversurprise Panic Operation!</font>

292
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I combined the first letters from each of those words to form the name SOP.</font>

293
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a great operation name!</font>

294
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the enemy is just a little girl, then you can leave this to me!</font>

295
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'm fired up!</font>

296
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky Hair Salon!</font>

297
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Battle-Hair!</font>

298
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fraland!</font>

299
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usoland!</font>

300
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're so dependable!</i></font>

301
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed! We are here for you!</font>

302
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way we can lose this battle!</font>

303
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take us to the underground passage, little ones!</font>

304
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Usolanders!</i></font>

305
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Meanwhile, Luffy was searching for the exit to the Corrida Colosseum.</i></font>

306
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

307
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't see any exits.</font>

308
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?</font>

309
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someday, I will work under Luffy-senpai. {Xemnas: "Shatei" is a yakuza term and means underling. Not sure if this wording fits completely, if anyone's got anything  better feel free to change it.}</font>

310
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's my dream.</font>

311
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You could at least close the door again!</font>

312
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The toilet?</font>

313
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're the hen-comb guy!</font>

314
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad to see you!</font>

315
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-L-Luffy-senpai!</font>

316
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

317
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep it together, Bartolomeo!</font>

318
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really want to give up the chance to speak with the Pirate King?</font>

319
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Bellamy.</font>

320
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! He's shining too brightly, I can't look him in the eyes!</font>

321
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-senpai!</font>

322
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you manage to meet up with Zoro-senpai?</font>

323
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I talked to him. Thanks!</font>

324
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it was nothing!</font>

325
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I suddenly have something I need to do, so I've gotta leave...</font>

326
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I can't find the exit.</font>

327
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This colosseum doesn't have an exit.</font>

328
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

329
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it just me...</font>

330
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or have your injuries gotten worse?</font>

331
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once a fighter enters the colosseum, they can never leave.</font>

332
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're wasting your time looking for an exit.</font>

333
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? What do you mean?</font>

334
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For real?</font>

335
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There really isn't one?!</font>

336
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't you supposed to be Doflamingo's underling?</font>

337
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you've gotta know something!</font>

338
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His underling? I couldn't even become that!</font>

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please! My friend is in danger!</font>

340
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm leaving.</font>

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you follow me, you might be able to get out too... Maybe.</font>

342
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, thanks!</font>

343
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll take me out?</font>

344
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I'm saying is, you might make it out by coincidence if you follow me.</font>

345
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want me to betray my boss?</font>

346
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

347
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">can't betray Doflamingo! {Sewil: Suck more flamingo dick please}</font>

348
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have too much respect for him.</font>

349
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, didn't he just...</font>

350
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

351
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have my own morals I must stick to.</font>

352
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it. I'll tag along behind you then.</font>

353
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then, Luffy-senpai...</font>

354
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about the Flame Fruit?</font>

355
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's someone I really don't want to have it, but I've got no choice.</font>

356
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My friends' lives are more important.</font>

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry, I'll handle it!</font>

358
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:26,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a memento of Ace-sama. I was always planning to give it to you, Luffy-senpai!</font>

359
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? You'll give it to me?</font>

360
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course! If anyone should have it, it's you!</font>

361
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your accent keep getting heavier.</font>

362
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah'll definitely get ya the Flame Fruit!</font>

363
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just go do whatever it was ya needed to do!</font>

364
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you talking to?</font>

365
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, that really helps.</font>

366
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you have the Flame Fruit...{For the record, the opening credits to the episode literally refers to him as such. -Starfish}</font>

367
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

368
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you?{Oh, and that previous comment about his accent slipping, he seems to have recovered now... Though he's always spoken with a bit of an accent that I can't quite define which has been all but completely ignored in our subs... -Starfish}</font>

369
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you just casually talking to Luffy-senpai like that?</font>

370
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is the younger brother of that legendary pirate Fire Fist Ace-sama,</font>

371
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the future Pirate King, you dumbass!</font>

372
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've known that for a long time.</font>

373
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now the real battle starts!</font>

374
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd better make it to the final round! { def: wait, wouldn't that mean that she's hoping to be eliminated herself?  that seems mighty nice of her }</font>

375
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he doing? How dare he act all chummy with Luffy-senpai?!</font>

377
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See? He got him mad!</font>

378
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:17,080
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The plaza outside the Corrida Colosseum</font>

379
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you come out crying?!</font>

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You couldn't find the Pirate Hunter?!</font>

381
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't I tell you to keep your guard up?! {Man, they sure are running ridiculously slowly. -Starfish}{Xemnas" Dat slow mo running.}</font>

382
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Call the Vice-Admiral!</font>

383
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

384
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Navy has completely fallen for our disguise. They believe us to be toys.</font>

385
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is still cutting it too close!</font>

386
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And why'd you choose these specific animals?</font>

387
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought these animals were <i>kewl!</i> Especially, carps? {Yeah I just copied FUNi verbatim here, because while I got that he was making some sort of lame pun, I didn't get WHAT the lame pun was... So here, have the lame pun FUNi used. -Starfish}{Cecil: Xemnas pls, I'd rather we understood this than use funi's translation :D}{Xemnas: Funi seems to have done a good job, since this looks fine. I think "Poppi" is slang for hip, or like "the in thing" and "Koi" means carp, so this works really well.}</font>

388
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, shut up you! Do you even want to save Traf?!</font>

389
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll save Traf! I'll send Mingo flying!</font>

390
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we don't have to worry about the Flame Fruit either.</font>

391
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But are you okay?</font>

392
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems Robin-san is somewhere in this country too.</font>

393
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd really like to see her again.</font>

394
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:13,760
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Revolutionary Army - Fishman Karate assistant instructor
Koala</font>

395
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you got to meet up with your friend.</font>

396
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... I thought he was going to hit me.</font>

397
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you crying?</font>

398
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

399
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you have made a difference if you were there?</font>

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can say for sure.</font>

401
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

402
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you've figured out what's happening underground, tell me.</font>

403
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

404
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, I will get Ace's Flame Fruit.</font>

405
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will carry on his will!</font>

406
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did't thing he waz alive...</font>

407
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you talking about?!</font>

408
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought...</font>
