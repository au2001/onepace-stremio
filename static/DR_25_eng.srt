00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, and I have decided that by beating Doflamingo to a pulp,</font>

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can return the favor to you and God Usopp.</font>

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'm gonna beat Doflamingo.</font>

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

136
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,360

140
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On my pride as a warrior of Elbaf, I shall defeat Doflamingo and repay my debt to you.</font>

146
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, the ones to beat him will be us!</font>

147

162
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what about this?</font>

163
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll beat up Doflamingo, and you guys can support us.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What are you on about, I'll defeat Doflamingo!</i></font>

165
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,280

184
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys were the toys that were with us underground.</font>

185
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have quite the gall!</font>

186
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Capture them!</font>

187
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go to hell, you ungrateful bastards!</font>

188
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go.</font>

189
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

190
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy!</font>

191
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bull?</font>

192
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got an idea.</font>

193
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something in the smoke!</font>

194
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-A bull?!</font>

195
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

196
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's here!</font>

197
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pica-sama, we've found him!</font>

198
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

199
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've returned here!</font>

200
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them get away!</font>

201
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're riding a bull. It's those three from before.</font>

202
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And four, five, six... seven.</font>

203
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Straw Hat!</font>

204
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you all to stop following me!</font>

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-Their numbers... are increasing!</font>

206
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be the one to kill Doflamingo!</font>

207
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

208
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take him out, even if I have to kill all of you to do it!</font>

209
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about. I'll do it!</font>

210
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I will!</font>

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do they suddenly have more allies?!</font>

212
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How should I know!</font>

213
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're all participants from the Colosseum!</font>

214
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether it's three or three hundred people, it makes no difference!</font>

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!</font>

216
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hasshoken Secret Technique!</font>

217
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,200

218
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might not be fully charged...</font>

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Light version...</font>

220
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Punch!</font>

221
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,930

222
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,560

223
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate we'll be the ones to defeat Doflamingo!</font>

224
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop following me already!</font>

225
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shut up, you damn savior!</i></font>

226
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you all say?!</font>

227
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All flash and no bang.</font>

228
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is nothing my drilling head cannot break!</font>

229
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

230
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Ucy! To the palace!</font>

231
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get squashed! I'm counting on you, Ucy!</font>

232
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey. Didn't I tell you to stay away?</font>

233
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get off Ucy's back!</font>

234
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't be that way.</font>

235
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, Straw Hat-san!</font>

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy, I'm counting on you!</font>

237
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Don't let them pass!</font>

238
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're headed for the palace!</font>

239
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take you on!</font>

240
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ideo, the King of Martial Arts?!</font>

241
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let Straw Hat escape!</font>

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get distracted.</font>

243
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Destructive Cannon!</font>

244
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanna stop me? Then bring in some stronger men!</font>

245
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with these guys?</font>

246
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A-Admiral Orlumbus!</i></font>

247
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my path!</font>

248
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Admiral...</font>

249
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hug!</font>

250
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now! Fire!</font>

251
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful Sword!</font>

252
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swan Lake!</font>

253
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look up!</font>

254
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another punch is on the way!</font>

255
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so persistent!</font>

256
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Want another-</font><font size="20">?!</font>

257
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Drop it, you two!</font>

258
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can restore his broken arms.</font>

259
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you fight him without knowing his capabilities, you'll just waste your energy.</font>

260
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what should we do?</font>

261
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case...</font>

262
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Run!</i></font>

263
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you call yourself a strategist?!  Come up with a better plan!</font>

264
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hush! Running is a perfectly viable strategy!</font>

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get the hell out of here!</font>

266
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't go straight forward. Our only hope is to find a way around.</font>

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That guy is such a pain.</font>

268
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't reach the palace unless we stop him.</font>

269
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, where did Straw Hat go?</font>

270
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't see him!</font>

271
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was he crushed along with the buildings?!</font>

272
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There he is!</font>

273
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a shortcut! Alright!</font>

274
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He's on him?!</i></font>

275
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Ucy!</font>

276
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

277
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he insane?!</font>

278
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't steal my thunder!</font>

279
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it.</font>

280
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now let's keep going to the palace!</font>

281
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah! Go, Ucy!</i></font>

282
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

283
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes?</font>

284
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you "Go!" me!</font>

285
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes?</font>

286
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get off! You're too heavy for Ucy!</font>

287
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, of course.</font>

288
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon the late introduction. I'm Jeet.</font>

289
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the big guy behind me...</font>

290
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Abdullah.</font>

291
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't ask!</font>

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

293
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's freaking pissed!</font>

294
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you get near Doffy!</font>

295
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His arm!</font>

296
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat-san?!</font>

297
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

298
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grizzly Magnum!</font>

299
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He did it!</i></font>

300
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He smashed him?!</font>

301
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pica-sama!</i></font>

302
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He did it!</i></font>

303
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome, Straw Hat-san!</font>

304
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great job!</font>

305
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, now let's hurry to the palace!</font>

306
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, the head you just smashed was nothing but stone!</font>

307
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Huh?!</i></font>

308
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're just running on a statue now.</font>

309
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he disappear again?</font>

310
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His real body is right ahead!</font>

311
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? That's the stone-guy?</font>

312
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First time I've seen him looking like a human being.</font>

313
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's got a huge sword!</font>

314
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dodge!</font>

315
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can't dodge him, then stop!</font>

316
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We won't make it!</i></font>

317
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The bull is flying?!</i></font>

318
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice is so funny!</font>

319
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

320
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Here he comes again!</i></font>

321
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going ahead!</font>

322
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

323
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!  I got this!</font>

324
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Amazing!</i></font>

325
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way!</font>

326
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's God's crew for you!</font>

327
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, I'm counting on you!</font>

328
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go send Doflamingo flying!</font>

329
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger that, Captain.</font>

330
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have unfinished business with Straw Hat. Move!</font>

331
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My captain has no business with a pebble like you.</font>

332
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll have to settle for me, you oversized soprano.</font>

333
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, the monster stopped moving. Is he dead?</font>

334
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I doubt it.</font>

335
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if it means his bothersome punches have stopped, then this is our chance!</font>

336
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will take down Doflamingo!</font>

337
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I will!</font>

338
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  Keep going, Ucy!</font>

339
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, do your best, bull!</font>

340
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bull!</font>

341
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long are you gonna hang around?! Get off!</font>

342
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, stop it, Straw Hat-san!</font>

343
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hatter.</font>

344
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

345
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand that we have no choice but to fight.</font>

346
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've made up my mind.</font>

347
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The plan I first suggested was an indirect way to crush Doflamingo.</font>

348
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But to be honest, I, too, wanted to take him down directly.</font>

349
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I lost earlier, but this time I'll get him!</font>

350
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thirteen years ago, someone very dear to me...</font>

351
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was killed by Doflamingo.</font>

352
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His name was Corazón.</font>

353
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was a top commander in the Donquixote Family.</font>

354
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! He was one of Mingo's men?!</font>

355
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  I owe my life to him.</font>

356
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was also...</font>

357
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo's little brother!</font>
