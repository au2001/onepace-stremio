00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! You guys are 
gonna be wax figures?</font>

130
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's what we've been trying to tell you!</font>

131
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just destroy this set, Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>!

132
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">R-Right! Okay!</font>

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How dare you try and interfere!</font>

134
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wax-Wax Arts: Harpoon!</font>

135
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Exploding Star!</font>

136
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Pretty bland. You don't use 
high-quality gunpowder.</font>

137
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My exploding star... he ate it!</font>

138
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is bad. It really <i>is</i> fast.</font>

139
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Good thing I posed beforehand.</font>

140
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">You moron!</font>

141
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Please, hurry!

142
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All right! That pumpkin's
the problem, right?!</font>

143
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hang on!</font>

144
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

145
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's no use!</font>

146
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Candle Wall!</font>

147
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Bazooka!</font>

148
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! Outta the way!</font>

149
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That would be <i>my</i> line.</font>

150
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'd appreciate it if you didn't
interfere with my creative activities.</font>

151
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Candle Lock!</font>

152
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Thanks for the mallet!</font>

153
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

154
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Drat!</font>

155
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Candle Wall!</font>

156
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mallet!</font>

157
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hooray! Hooray!</font>

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">– M-Mr. 3!
– Impossible!</font>

159
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy, hurry and break this set
while there's still time!</font>

160
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't wanna.</font>

161
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Quit joking around and hurry!</font>

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No.</font>

163
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This isn't the time for your antics!</font>

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Please!

165
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What should I do?</font>

166
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't wanna save you guys.</font>

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What are you saying?</font>

168
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Colors Trap.</font>

169
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! Luffy!</font>

170
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There's no time! Do something
about this thing already!</font>

171
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah, I know.</font>

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">– If you know, then hurry!
– Come on, Luffy!</font>

173
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I know, but...</font>

174
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But I don't wanna save you.</font>

175
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah, you keep saying that!</font>

176
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Meanwhile, we're almost wax figures!</font>

177
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Understand?! We're about to die!</font>

178
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah. But for some reason,
I just don't care anymore.</font>

179
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's not <i>about</i> whether you care!</font>

180
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">D-Dammit! 
What the hell's <i>with</i> him?!</font>

181
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If he doesn't get moving, our friends're gonna die!</font>

182
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll bring him to his senses!</font>

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's go, Karoo!</font>

184
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wh-When did you...?!</font>

185
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Give it up. He's already
fallen into a trap.</font>

186
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's right. 
See where he's standing?</font>

187
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Where he's standing?</font>

188
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's see here.</font>

189
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's that?
There's a strange black symbol.</font>

190
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's so important about that?!</font>

191
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're right. It's nothing.
It's just paint.</font>

192
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Paint?</font>

193
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">To sum it up, it symbolizes the end for both you... <i>and</i> your friends!</font>

194
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo! Let's just run for now!</font>

195
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They're flying the coop!</font>

196
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's get 'em.</font>

197
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Full speed ahead!</font>

198
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, you! Wait!
I haven't gotten on yet! Karoo!</font>

199
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Alright! Hey! Stop! Lemme on!</font>

200
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why the hell are you afraid of <i>me<font size="8"> </font></i></font>?!

201
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Miss Golden Week!</font>

202
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is your doing!</font>

203
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Colors Trap: Betrayal Black.</font>

204
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Touch the black paint,</font>

205
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and you'll want to betray your 
friends, no matter what they say.</font>

206
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What does she mean?!
Tell us what happened!</font>

207
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That girl is a realist painter who can 
recreate the colors of emotion.</font>

208
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wha...?</font>

209
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Her refined sense of color
can be used to manipulate</font>

210
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">those who interact with her paints.</font>

211
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Manipulate?! That's not good!</font>

212
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That simpleminded idiot is
already easy enough to manipulate!</font>

213
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then... can't he just 
step off the paint?</font>

214
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Get away from there!</font>

215
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No, don't!</font>

216
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Whatever you do,
do not move from that black circle!

217
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm begging you!</font>

218
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Vivi! Why?!</font>

219
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We absolutely do not 
want you to save us!</font>

220
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh, yeah?</font>

221
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I see now.</font>

222
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He's being made to do the 
exact opposite of what he's told.</font>

223
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Huh?</font>

224
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Th-That was a bit weird just now.</font>

225
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Hurry!

226
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Alright! Time to save you!</font>

227
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Aw, forget it, you guys! 
Gotta laugh!</font>

228
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Why?!</font>

229
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You little...!</font>

230
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>Now</i> what?!</font>

231
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Colors Trap: Laughter Yellow.</font>

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey now. Stay still.</font>

233
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's on his clothes!</font>

234
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Hurry and take off that vest!</font>

235
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">N-Never mind that!</font>

236
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I just wanna laugh right now!</font>

237
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Son of a...!</font>

238
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">At the pace it's raining down,
we won't last another minute!</font>

239
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Did you guys only come to fool around?!</font>

240
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Look! When Usopp ran into him,
the paint on his back smudged!</font>

241
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Did she do something to me again?</font>

242
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, you! Knock it off, you cheater!</font>

243
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Was my Laughter Yellow a riot?</font>

244
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Shut up! Are you nuts? You dummy!</font>

245
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Anyway, I gotta break that pumpkin!</font>

246
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

248
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,040

249
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Where're you aiming?!</font>

250
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're not allowed to break it!
You'll make Mr. 3 angry!</font>

251
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What the hell?!</font>

252
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The same way bulls 
need to charge at red capes,</font>

253
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">you now can't help but attack 
my bullfight red mark.</font>

254
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Too bad.</font>

255
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You suck!
I'm gonna send you flying!</font>

256
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum Bazooka!</font>

257
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Having fun?</font>

258
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's no good.</font>

259
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This isn't his kind of fight.</font>

260
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">His powers are useless here!</font>

261
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And the finishing touch!</font>

262
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll mix the Laughter Yellow 
on your back with Sadness Blue!</font>

263
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Colors Trap: Tranquil Green!</font>

264
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This tea is tasty.</font>

265
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You moron!</font>

266
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So now what?</font>

267
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">See? I told you you should've posed!</font>

268
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Too late for that.</font>

269
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How are you still so calm?!</font>

270
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Damn! They're freakin' fast!</font>

271
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nose Fancy Double Cannon!</font>

272
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You missed! Way to go, Karoo!</font>

273
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My turn!</font>

274
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lethal Lead Star!</font>

275
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We gotta return 
to Luffy and the others!</font>

276
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All this running around is pointless.</font>

277
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No kidding!</font>

278
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I didn't want to use it
on such a small-timer,</font>

279
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but there's no dodging this.</font>

280
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A .44-caliber,
six-shot, flintlock revolver.</font>

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A new model from the South Blue.</font>

282
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's rapid-fire,</font>

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and when I use it,
no one'll see it coming.</font>

284
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy's acting strange because of
that paint the bad guys mentioned!</font>

285
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They're related somehow!</font>

286
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Not to mention, he had some on his 
back when I crashed into him earlier.</font>

287
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm sure of it!</font>

288
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I gotta take care of that paint!</font>

289
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hurry!</font>

290
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Ahh, such lovely tea.</font>

291
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">So nice.</font>

292
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Are you kidding me?!</font>

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Such... lovely... tea...</font>

294
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What are you doing, you dumbass?!</font>

295
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's all over for you.</font>

296
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This ability is second to none.</font>

297
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lethal Fire Star!</font>

298
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How dumb can you get?! 
Who shoots their own allies?!</font>

299
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wasn't he gonna shoot?!</font>

300
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Breeze Breath Bomb!</font>

301
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh yeah, my breath is explosive too.</font>

302
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dammit! This is insane!
There weren't even bullets?!</font>

303
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo! You okay?!</font>

304
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! You awake yet?!</font>

305
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Y-Yeah.</font>

306
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm awake! Thanks!</font>

307
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">He attacked his friend 
on purpose to burn his vest</font>

308
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">and destroy the trap!</font>

309
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I've had enough of that paint!</font>

310
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I won't let you kill anyone else!</font>

311
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now I'm pissed off!</font>

312
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Something's not right. 
Definitely not right.</font>

313
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's been too long, 
and everyone's still gone.</font>

314
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Something must've happened to
Nami-<i>san</i>, Vivi-<i>chan</i>, and the rest.</font>

315
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">If so, now's not the time to be 
cooking up this lizard.</font>

316
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nami-<i>san<font size="8"> </font></i></font>! Vivi-<i>chwan<font size="8"> </font></i>!

317
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey! You out there?! I love you!</font>

318
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's this?</font>

319
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Who cares if you're pissed off?
Just look at your friends now!</font>

320
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's your point?! They're still alive!</font>

321
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You sure 'bout that?</font>

322
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">When Miss Golden Week 
finishes painting them,</font>

323
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">they'll be exceptional wax figures!</font>

324
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're too late, Straw Hat!</font>

325
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That's correct!</font>

326
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Your time is up, and now you 
will taste the bitterness of despair!</font>

327
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Deploy!</font>

328
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Candle...</font>

329
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Champion!</font>

330
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's that?</font>

331
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They say he took down someone 
worth 42 million belly with that thing.</font>

332
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's Mr. 3's artistic masterpiece!</font>

333
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Come, Miss Golden Week!
Paint me using your artistry.</font>

334
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Then can I relax?</font>

335
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yes, of course! I'd actually
prefer you stay out of this!</font>

336
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Like this, I am invincible!</font>

337
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The wax armor encasing me is 
hard as steel, yet so flexible!</font>

338
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">My form now...</font>

339
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">has no weak point!</font>

340
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">S-So cool!</font>

341
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is no time to be admiring him! Fight!</font>

342
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All right!</font>

343
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

344
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Paint job complete!</font>

345
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now, then!</font>

346
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Pistol!</font>

347
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Champ Fight: Field Combine!</font>

348
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

349
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Stamp!</font>

350
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's no use!</font>

351
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Not good! Luffy's attacks 
won't work on something so solid!</font>

352
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Damn! The wax mist!</font>

353
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Wax?</font>

354
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah! Why didn't I see it sooner?!</font>

355
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just the fact that it can mist 
means it can melt!</font>

356
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! Fire melts this guy's wax!</font>

357
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No matter how hard it is,
wax is still wax!</font>

358
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Zoro, Master Brogy, and all the 
others hardened only moments ago!</font>

359
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We can save them!</font>

360
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What?! For real?!</font>

361
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah. For real.</font>

362
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't just admit it like that!</font>

363
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Okay, so you've realized the truth,</font>

364
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">but you're out of time 
and out of luck!</font>

365
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'd say there's at most 30 more seconds!</font>

366
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">After that, their hearts
will have stopped completely!</font>

367
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Darkness now closes in on them,
their bodies wracked with pain,</font>

368
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">as they experience
the terror of dying!</font>

369
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't need 30 seconds!
I'll save them now!</font>

370
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Lethal Fire–</font>

371
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Breeze Breath Bomb!</font>

372
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Usopp!</font>

373
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Didn't you hear the man say 
your luck's run out?</font>

374
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Dammit! There's no time!</font>

375
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just give up!</font>

376
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Listen. Take this rope.</font>

377
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh? This looks like fun!</font>

378
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Whatcha planning?
Can I join in, too?</font>

379
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Karoo. Run.</font>

380
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Run!</font>

381
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Just keep running around 
all the candles!</font>

382
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's pointless! Give up!</font>

383
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">'Scuse me.</font>

384
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Crescendo Stone!</font>

385
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Let's see how many kilograms it takes till you break!</font>

386
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">10 kilograms!</font>

387
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">100 kilograms!</font>

388
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">200 kilograms!</font>

389
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">300 kilograms!</font>

390
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Damn nimble bird!</font>

391
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Give it up! Give it up!</font>

392
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">They've already become 
my masterful works of art!</font>

393
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I don't think so!</font>

394
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I won't lose them 
to a weirdo like you!</font>

395
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,470

then I'll use this fire!</font>

396
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't pull! Stop!</font>

397
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Luffy! That small flame
won't work fast enough!</font>

398
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Light Karoo's rope on fire!</font>

399
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The bird's rope?!</font>

400
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's a special rope...</font>

401
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">soaked in oil!</font>

404
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Things're gonna heat up, 
but bear with it.</font>

405
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Stop!</font>

406

Are they gonna be okay?!</font>

408
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You've done it now, Straw Hat!</font>

409
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How dare you lay waste

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Get back here, you jerks!</font>

412
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,640

415
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm gonna shatter your neck...</font>

416
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">into itty bitty fragments!</font>

418
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Was using that much heat 
really necessary?</font>

419
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Complaining already? Show a little gratitude toward your savior!</font>

420
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You're right. Thanks!</font>

421
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This doesn't seem real! We're alive!</font>

422
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">The wax melted? What a pain!</font>

423
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">We can't afford to blow 
another mission!</font>

424
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Mr. 5!</font>

427
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'm a human bomb! You've seen 
that explosives don't work on me!</font>

428
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You took the bait!</font>

429
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Too bad for you! I'm a liar, you see!</font>

430
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That wasn't an exploding star!
It was a special tabasco star!</font>

431
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Spicy!</font>

432

effectiveness the hard way!</font>

433
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">You lousy pirates!</font>

434
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I'll blow you away 
with a full-body explosion!</font>

435
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">There won't even be bone fragments left!</font>

436
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No! Stop!</font>

437
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">No! I'm sorry! It won't happen again!</font>

438
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Flaming Oni...</font>

442
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yo. Good to see you're alive.</font>

443
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Yeah.</font>

444
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Master.</font>

445
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">That leaves two foes remaining.</font>

446
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Bird!</font>

447
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Don't let them get away!</font>

Welcome to my Wax-Wax Mansion!</font>

450
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What is this?!</font>

451
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:31,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Well, then. 
Can you pick out the real me?</font>

452
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It seems you picked a fight
with the wrong people!</font>

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Our team's intellect is unparalleled 
in all of Baroque Works!</font>

454
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">A brute like you, acting on instinct 
alone, has no hope against us!</font>

455
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I am Mr. 3.</font>

456
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I flawlessly execute any mission 
to which I am assigned.</font>

457
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Now, then! Step inside!</font>

458
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">But the moment you turn your back 
to me, you'll get a dagger...</font>

459
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">right through the heart.</font>

460
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Gum-Gum...</font>

461
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,020

462
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">How... did you know...</font>

463
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">I was here?</font>

464
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Instinct.</font>

465
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Indeed, afternoons are best spent with a cup of Earl Grey.</font>

466
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Hey, wait a minute!</font>

467
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">This is no time for me to be
sipping tea all fancy like!</font>

468
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Nami-<i>san</i> and the others might be 
waiting for me to save them!</font>

469
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">All the same, why's a relaxing place like this in the middle of a jungle?</font>

470
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">What's that?</font>

471
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Oh.</font>

472
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">It's a transponder snail.</font>

473
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Heya, you've reached
<i>Restaurant de Merde</i>.</font>

474
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Making a reservation?</font>

475
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">Quit fooling around, you idiot.</font>

with your report?</i></font>

477
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,130

478
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="37">And who might I be talking to?</font>

479
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="37"><i>It's me.</i></font>
