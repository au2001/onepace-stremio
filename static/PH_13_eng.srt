53
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:19,150

54
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meaning the Straw Hats escaped from the cage and then helped all the G-5 marines get away.</font>

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,380

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,500

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,440

00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know!</font>

64
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the case, having Law free is not good.</font>

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that both the Straw Hat crew and the marines are heading for the escape passage!</font>

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do!?</font>

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but did they actually mean that Luffy and the others could escape on their own?</font>

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,460

75
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The main force is making battle preparations at the post near the back of Building-B!</font>

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pretty clear that they just want to escape from this island,</font>

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in which case they'll be taking a straight path towards Building-R and Gate-66!</font>

78
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not gonna let that happen! Close the walkway between Building-A and Building-B!</font>

79
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Closing this gate will isolate Building-A.</font>

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we can destroy Building-A and let Shinokuni flood inside!</font>

81
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? If we do that then our guards will also beâ€”</font>

105
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law, what's that alarm sounding for?</font>

106
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the warning sound that this building's gate is closing and blocking the only path into Building B.</font>

107
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!?</font>

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's probably trying to lock us all out.</font>

112
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't even try it!</font>

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of our way!</font>

114
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's hot!</font>

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's cold!</font>

116
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice! Three reliable swordsmen!</font>

117
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for asking you to carry us all, Brownbeard.</font>

118
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no bother, but why did you guys bring that dragon along?</font>

119
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were only holding onto him since we thought that he could fly us away from the gas,</font>

120
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he didn't fly at all.</font>

121
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he can't fly right now because he's been injected with sedatives.</font>

122
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, bringing him into the laboratory may prove to be problematic.</font>

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he dangerous? He has a pretty cute face though.</font>

124
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't get this chance again! Take them out!</font>

126
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty sure I warned you guys about that!</font>

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so you're a captain now are you, little miss look-alike?</font>

129
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,540

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-5, we don't have time for fighting right now! Please, hurry to the passage at the back!</font>

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's only one gate in this building and it's starting to close! Caesar's trying to lock us all in here!</font>

133
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't head for that gate we'll all be trapped on Punk Hazard! Quickly, head for the back now!</font>

134
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-This is bad! Let's get moving, do as Tashigi-chan says, guys!</font>

135
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry the wounded!</font>

136
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a straight line! Aim for the gate!</font>

137
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a terrible thing to do.</font>

138
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin, where have you been?</font>

139
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan!</font>

140
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had to do a little favor for Luffy.</font>

141
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, did you hear what that marine said!? Keep going, Brownybeard! Move faster!</font>

142
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way, I'm going flat out as it is!</font>

143
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sick of running!</font>

144
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that? A complaint?</font>

145
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wasn't!</font>

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a samurai so I'll just say it!</font>

147
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough of this!</font>

148
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, why is Brownbeard with those pirates!?</font>

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think that bastard might've betrayed Master!?</font>

150
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master is our savior!</font>

151
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just keep running! We're in trouble, too!</font>

152
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's move it, G-5!</font>

153
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really is about to close!</font>

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move it, move it!</font>

155
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Experiment cannon, standby!</font>

156
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,050
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Laboratory Exterior</font>

157
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Target is set as the outer wall of Building A, Third Laboratory!</font>

158
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that wall breaking!?</font>

159
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait, seriously!?</font>

160
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding!</font>

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run! Just run!</font>

162
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

163
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

164
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

165
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get through the gate!</font>

166
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get inside or you're dead!</font>

167
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we made it!</font>

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we have!</font>

169
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just barely!</font>

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh!? Captain-chan just came flying in!</font>

171
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you're safe, but why were you flying?</font>

172
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please move aside! There're still marines out there!</font>

173
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't! It's already filled with gas!</font>

174
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please move, the gate'll close soon!</font>

175
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">You mustn't!</font>

176
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go! They're still out there! Let me go!</font>

177
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">The gate's almost closed already!</font>

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san left them in my care! I will protect them all!</font>

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now please move aside!</font>

180
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use, Captain-chan, it's too late!</font>

181
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, guys! We've safely received our precious captain from you!</font>

182
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What utter scum! Still, far too many of them survived!</font>

183
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let them escape. Not a single one!</font>

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,290
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Connecting passage for buildings A & B</font>

185
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's sacrificed the laboratory to let the gas inside.</font>

186
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, pick up the pace!</font>

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys! When did all of you get on my back!? It's getting too heavy for me!</font>

188
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, but you'll have to stick it out a little longer. There's no other choice.</font>

189
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're...</font>

190
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">really tired and we can't be bothered to run anymore.</font>

191
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a terrible reason! Get off me!</font>

192
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are called Brownbeard, correct?</font>

193
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me, but I simply must rescue my son, Momonosuke, as soon as possible.</font>

194
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I've already done a lot of running and I can't actually be bothered to do any more.</font>

195
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get off me you stupid bastards!</font>

196
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pretty hot with this coat on inside the laboratory.</font>

197
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you can hang it over here.</font>

198
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make yourselves at home on people's backs! If you're not hurt then you can run yourselves!</font>

199
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm feeling a little peckish.</font>

200
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never hunger, for I have the stomach of a samurai.</font>

201
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brownbeard-san, do you have anything to eat?</font>

202
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! The minute we reach one of the soldiers' posts I'm gonna shake you all off my back!</font>

203
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,350
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Connecting passage for buildings A & B</font>

204
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain-chan, We've gotta get moving!</font>

205
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought Punk Hazard was locked down, but that guy was making weapons of mass destruction here!</font>

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta act before the whole world's affected!</font>

207
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta get off the island and alert Navy Headquarters!</font>

208
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can't make it back alive to the main force then what did those guys just sacrifice their lives for!?</font>

209
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:21,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

210
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

211
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute.</font>

212
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's on the ceiling!</font>

213
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that thing!?</font>

214
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it was with those Straw Hat guys earlier!</font>

215
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like some kinda lizard!</font>

216
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard stories about this. About how Punk Hazard has real dragons on it.</font>

217
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doctor Vegapunk artificially created these mythical beasts to protect the island.</font>

218
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't look so scary a minute ago!</font>

219
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He dodged!?</font>

220
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-T-That's steel!</font>

221
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get bitten by jaws like that...</font>

222
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, get moving to Building B now!</font>

223
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It flies, breathes fire and chews steel!</font>

224
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kinda monster is this!?</font>

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

226
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gone.</font>

227
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It ran away?</font>

228
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something spooked him.</font>

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Tashigi, this is awesome!</font>

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our strongest backup is here on Punk Hazard!</font>

231
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Vice Admiral has come to save us!</font>

232
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vergo!</font>

233
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice Admiral Smokey and Vice Admiral Vergo! The two heads of the G-5 are here!</font>

234
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna be invincible now!</font>

235
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

236
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we're saved now!</font>

237
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run! All of you, run away!</font>

238
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">V-Vice Admiral Vergo, did those guys do something wrong?</font>

239
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if they needed a beating, getting hit by your Finger Gun can kill!</font>

240
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Welcome.</i></font>

241
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I've heard much about you, Commodore Smoker, it's nice to meet you.</i></font>

242
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My G-5 boys are as rough and stupid as they come, but once you get to know them</i></font>

243
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>they're not as bad as the rest of the world says.</i></font>

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Before too long you'll come to think of them fondly.</i></font>

245
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Where's Vice Admiral Vergo?</i></font>

246
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't worry about it. Vice Admiral Vergo has to hurry back home from time to time.</i></font>

247
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>His younger sister is pretty sick.</i></font>

248
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you guys really the Navy!?</font>

249
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I am sorry.</i></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm entirely responsible for the actions of my subordinates.</i></font>

251
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Oh, is that right? Well then, you'd better take full responsibility right now!</i></font>

252
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Bitch!</i></font>

253
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't get carried away!</i></font>

254
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,240

257

296
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a score to settle with Vergo.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ready?</font>

311
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'm not! Can't you wait a minute!?</font>

312
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been running so damn fast I set the ground on fire!</font>

313
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you, flying through the air on that fluffy cloud of smoke, that's gotta be cheating!</font>

314
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, you ready?</font>

315
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a moment! Hey, didn't I already say wait a minute!?</font>

316

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! I haven't even said "let's go" yet!</font>

319
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You listening? Vergo is my enemy!</font>

320
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I know. Caesar is mine! Keep your damn hands off him!</font>
