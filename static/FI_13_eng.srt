so much suffering in your homeland,</font>

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, sorry for taking so much of your time.</font>

76
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, we have to find out what's happening
at Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody and his crew attacked.
His Majesty and the guards have been captured.</font>

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyuu- Jinbe-san.</font>

81
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:01,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If things are going according to Hody's plan, even worse things are happening around the country now.</font>

82
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know what Hody is planning?!</font>

83
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always suspected that he was planning something in the Fishman District after leaving the army...</font>

84
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he never gave me an opportunity to find out what it was.</font>

85
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I know his plan.</font>

86
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody hates humans even more than Arlong-san does.</font>

87
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like he's grown up by feeding on the anger and hatred of the fishmen.</font>

88
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, he's clearly different from Arlong-san.</font>

89
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san looked down on humans,
but he'd never hurt his fellow fishmen.</font>

90
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But with Hody...</font>

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you're just a fishman who wants to live in peace with humans...</font>

92
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he will mercilessly attack you!</font>

93
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The World Council Meeting only takes place every four years and will happen this year, right?</font>

94
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gathered a lot of signatures.</font>

95
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was going to be the year when
King Neptune finally let the world know...</font>

96
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that Fishman Island wants to emigrate to the surface!</font>

97
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me...</font>

98
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody wants to prevent that from happening?!</font>

99
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, even more than that...</font>

100
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

101
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A gigantic Snail Phone?!</font>

102

115
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,680

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the one who's making us step on the fumi-e?</font>

132
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, isn't he the one that shot Otohime-sama's killer
right after her assassination?</font>

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  That's Hody Jones!  There's no doubt!</font>

134
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't he a soldier in the Neptune Army?</font>

135
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have an announcement for everyone on Fishman Island.</font>

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This country will soon be destroyed.</font>

137
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then it will be reformed under a new king...</font>

138
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who will be me!</font>

139
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is he saying?</font>

140
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he trying to pull?!
There's no way that'll happen!</font>

141
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is he broadcasting from?</font>

142
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is the King?</font>

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And didn't I hear something about
the Straw Hat Pirates occupying the palace?</font>

144
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happened to our country?!</font>

145
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the new Fishman Island that I rule over
will have <i>absolute</i> laws.</font>

146
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this moment,
people are coming here from the Fishman District.</font>

147
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They will be the new citizens of this land.</font>

148
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They hate the humans, just like we do.</font>

149
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are comrades who wish to change this island,
just like we do.</font>

150
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  They're coming here?</font>

151
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those lawless ruffians are going to live here?</font>

152
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that most of you saw
the death of your beloved Queen Otohime.</font>

153
00:12:52,910 --> 00:13:00,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime had worked tirelessly in order to create a connection between us and the humans.</font>

154
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who killed her?!  It was the humans themselves.</font>

155
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you trust them and meet them halfway, humans will just stab you in the back!</font>

156
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why can't you understand that?!</font>

157
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard...</font>

158
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been led astray by the Neptune Family.</font>

159
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are pushing you down a path that leads to death.</font>

160
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their naive ideals are just
pretty words that can never come true!</font>

161
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wishful thinking that will lead you to destruction!</font>

162
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

163
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at this.</font>

164
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

165
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

166
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

167
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

168
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the once-great Knight Neptune has fallen to old age.</font>

169
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no future for this island
if an old man is left on the throne.</font>

170
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that it's really our fault that the King was captured...</font>

171
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

172
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or Zoro's fault, really.</font>

173
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you do before you came here?!</font>

174
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  B-B-B-But Boss Jinbe!</font>

175
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was a misunderstanding, and the Neptune Army
attacked Nami-chin and her friends.</font>

176
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to end...</font>

177
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the old Ryuuguu monarchy.</font>

178
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three hours from now, in Gyoncord Plaza,</font>

179
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we will cut off the head of this worthless king.</font>

180
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've probably figured it out already, but I'm in Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

181
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We found something interesting here.</font>

182
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the piece of paper that Queen Otohime
risked her life to get from the Celestial Dragons...</font>

183
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">ten years ago.</font>

184
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it was destroyed,
they'd have no reason to ever give us another one.</font>

185
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also... we have this huge box.</font>

186
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It contains the signatures
of over half of the subjects of this country.</font>

187
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surely my eyes are deceiving me.</font>

188
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could there be so many fools who think we should kiss and make up with the humans?!</font>

189
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone who has written their name here
is opposed to my new kingdom.</font>

190
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, this is a list of traitors.</font>

191
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can quit using the fumi-e.</font>

192
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone can lie and step on her face to pass that test.</font>

193
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But these signatures
show who supports me and who opposes me.</font>

194
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are undeniable!</font>

195
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's start disposing of these people, one by one.</font>

196
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And finally...</font>

197
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

198
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have something good to show you.</font>

199
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know you're somewhere on this island watching this.</font>

200
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These humans earned the wrath of all fishmen by destroying the ambitions of Arlong's crew!</font>

201
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!  Usopp!  Brook!</font>

202
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell're those guys doing?</font>

203
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could they have been captured?!</font>

204
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it.</font>

205
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Sir!</font>

206
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it.</font>

207
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  What?  What's happening?</font>

208
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're so high up!</font>

209
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hear something...</font>

210
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rumbling sound...</font>

211
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's water!</font>

212
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Around the same time that we execute the King,
this room will finish filling with water.</font>

213
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such inferior creatures.
Humans die from something as trivial as this.</font>

214
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy, with a bounty of 400 million beli!</font>

215
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heads of you and your companions
will serve as warnings to the humans on the surface.</font>

216
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's time to start cleaning up
the old Ryuuguu Monarchy.</font>

217
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to leave behind the weakness of our past,
setting course for a strong future!</font>

218
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In three hours,
this country will be reborn as a proud Fishman Island!</font>

219
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could this happen?</font>

220
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let him do this!</font>

221
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!  The water keeps pouring in!</font>

222
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I just finished drying out too, Usopp-san.</font>

223
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to be submerged in seawater again.</font>

224
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Neither do I!</i></font>

225
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do something.  Anything!  Zoro-kun!</font>

226
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure thing.  Now then...</font>

227
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get me out of these chains.</font>

228
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

229
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes.
Chains, fall off... Chains, fall off...</font>

230
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chains, fall off... Fall off chains!</font>

231
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fall off!</font>

232
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no good... I don't have enough faith.</font>

233
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But did you see it?</font>

234
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The look on their faces when I started moving...</font>

235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ding!  Ding!  Ding!</i></font>

236
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We have a winner!</i></font>

237
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's... moving!</i></font>

238
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's right.  I'm "Nothing but Bones" Brook!</i></font>

239
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who's fault do you think it is that we ended up like this?!</i></font>

240
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!  They'll kill me!</font>

241
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, but I'm already dead.</font>

242
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Nami and her group managed to get out, right?</font>

243
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be fine if she manages to
get Luffy and the others.</font>

244
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what'll you do if he doesn't come?!</font>

245
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin'll be all...</font>

246
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"I wonder if Nami was killed and eaten
by the deep-sea fish."</font>

247
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Robin, alright!</font>

248
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a bit different from
the other poneglyphs I've seen so far.</font>

249
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost as if it's a letter... or a written apology?</font>

250
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you apologizing to?</font>

251
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you... Joyboy?</font>

252
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they just say that my bounty's at 400 million?!</font>

253
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did it go up?</font>

254
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if this is time for that!</font>

255
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've picked a fight with us, no doubt.</font>

256
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After the great war in Marineford,
your fame shot up through the roof.</font>

257
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once it surpasses 300 million,
it'll take a lot for them to raise it again.</font>

258
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if they want a fight then we'll give them one!</font>

259
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, Luffy-kun!</font>

260
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father...</font>

261
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father...</font>

262
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

263
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

264
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Megalo!</font>

265
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to go save him!</font>

266
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on a second, Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

267
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop, Megalo!</font>

268
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

269
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe-sama... But I...</font>

270
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both you and Luffy,
you need to stop for a second.</font>

271
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess, I also think it's better if you don't go.</font>

272
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi-sama.</font>

273
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In all of Ryuuguu Kingdom,
Hody's biggest fear right now is...</font>

274
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi's power.</font>

275
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he recreates Fishman Island
the way he wants it,</font>

276
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it will all be destroyed if the Sea Kings attack.</font>

277
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took the King hostage to use him as a shield.</font>

278
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So in other words, their true goal is Shirahoshi-chan?</font>

279
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nyuu- Hody isn't planning to
capture the Princess and use her power.</font>

280
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He fears the very existence of the power.</font>

281
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he teamed up with Vander Decken, who wants the Princess's life.</font>

282
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody plans to get rid of everything that stands in his way.</font>

283
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right.</font>

284
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Princess goes to the plaza it'll be just what he wants.</font>

285
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard the prophecy about my power before,</font>

286
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I've never been able to talk with the Sea Kings before.</font>

287
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't even know if I really have the power or not.</font>

288
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Either way, Hody will definitely want to finish you off.</font>

289
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we can't let Hody find out
that you can't control the power.</font>

290
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want him to be afraid of it.</font>

291
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You done yapping?</font>

292
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright then.</font>

293
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shark!  Take me to Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

294
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, I'm leaving Wimp in your care.</font>

295
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!  Leave it to me!</font>

296
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't I tell you to wait, Luffy-kun?</font>

297
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

298
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't fight with Hody!</font>

299
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you trying to stop me?</font>

300
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it because we're human?</font>

301
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't include yourselves, that just complicates things!</font>

302
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  It can't be you!</font>

303
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fishmen who don't hate humans already may wind up changing their minds!</font>

304
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave this to me.</font>

305
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe!  My friends have been captured!</font>

306
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I don't do something, they'll be in trouble!</font>

307
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin...</font>

308
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat...</font>

309
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still don't understand, after everything I said?!</font>

310
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going.</font>

311
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't understand a damn thing!</font>

312
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blah blah blah... shut up!</font>

313
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want me to stay, then try to stop me!</font>

314
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

315
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was foolish to think you'd listen to me, even after we've fought side by side.</font>

316
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had almost forgotten...</font>

317
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that you are his brother.</font>

318
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you don't intend to stay here,
there's no other way to do this.</font>

319
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin... Boss Jinbe...</font>

320
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  Jinbe!  Hang on!</font>

321
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you two doing?!</font>

322
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna go to Ryuuguu Palace, rescue my friends,</font>

323
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and send that Hody guy flying!</font>

324
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I'm telling you not to be rash!</font>

325
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, now!  Why are you fighting?</font>

326
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you two!</font>

327
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama... Boss Jinbe-sama...</font>

328
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shark, give me a ride!  To Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

329
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you, wait!</font>

330
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way!</font>

331
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Fishman Karate</i></font>

332
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Shark Tile True Fist</i></font>

333
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

334
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

335
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

336
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

337
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That hurt...</font>

338
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  It worked!</font>

339
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought physical attacks couldn't hurt a rubber man!</font>

340
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The true power of Fishman Karate
lies in its ability to control all water that it hits.</font>

341
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It creates a shockwave, from the water in the air
to the water inside one's body.</font>

342
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All living creatures are clusters of water.</font>

343
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even a rubber man can't escape it!</font>

344
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You bastard!</i></font>

345
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let you go, Luffy!</font>

346
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that all you got out of your training?</font>

347
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not done yet!</font>

348
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough.</font>

349
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Robin!</i></font>

350
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chwan!</font>

351
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, get out of the way, Robin! </font>

352
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?!  Move!</font>

353
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan is in trouble!</font>

354
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

355
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-chan...</font>

356
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't fight.</font>

357
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know the circumstances here, but aren't you on the same side?</font>

358
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  How did Robin get to the forest?!</font>

359
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, here I go.</font>

360
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second!</font>

361
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Explain what the hell is going on!</font>

362
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can even do that now?</font>

363
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yes, it happened...</font>

364
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">back when I was touring the world as the Soul King.</font>

365
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i><i>Booooone!</i></i></font>

366
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Wait, <i>whaaaaaat?!</i></i></font>

367
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What is going on?!</i></font>

368
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This technique even lets me slip through walls.</font>

369
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think I did?</font>

370
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you are a man, I am sure you already understand.</font>

371
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm so jealous! Zoro, he's making me jealous!</i></font>

372
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

373
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to leave for the execution stand.</font>

374
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Should we leave someone behind
here in Ryuuguu Palace, Boss Hody?</font>

375
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, there's no need.</font>

376
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ryuuguu Palace is impenetrable.</font>

377
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just leave behind a few gatekeepers
to open the gates when we return.</font>

378
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't have the King
locked out of his own castle, after all!</font>

379
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you've got a point there!</font>

380
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're no King -jamon!</font>

381
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't win the hearts of the people with violence!</font>

382
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've only got a few hours left to live.
Spout whatever nonsense you'd like until then.</font>

383
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My wound is aching.</font>

384
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wound from that arrogant swordsman.</font>

385
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The painkillers are wearing off.  Give me the Energy Steroids.</font>

386
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Sure...</font>

387
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pain is gone.</font>

388
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will he really be alright, taking that many?</font>

389
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Good question...</font>

390
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss, what about those three Straw Hats?</font>

391
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just humans.  Leave them alone, and they'll drown before long.</font>

392
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if someone tries to save them,
it's impossible to break into the palace.</font>

393
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly... How are things going
with the new citizens from the Fishman District?</font>

394
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problems at all.</font>

395
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've already started to move in.</font>

396
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  They'll have places to live soon enough.</font>

397
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Many people will leave the country or be killed.</font>

398
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can just use their houses.</font>

399
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will become a fine country,
where everyone despises the humans!</font>

400
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have found our light of hope!</font>

401
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone seems to have disappeared for some reason,
and the palace looks empty...</font>

402
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but Pappagg-san has been left behind!</font>

403
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, Brook.  Ask Pappagg to
look for the keys to these chains right away.</font>

404
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and the cage, and the room-</font>

405
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang on, idiot.</font>

406
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just need one sword.  Bring my swords here.</font>

407
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cut through all our obstacles.</font>

408
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, you're too reliable!</font>

409
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have arrived, with a "bone"!</font>

410
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ghost!</i></font>

411
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

412
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ghosts are so scary!</i></font>

413
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pappagg-san, it's me!</font>

414
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in a hurry!</font>

415
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Umm, get the key... No, a sword!</font>

416
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Umm, listen...</font>

417
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stay away from me!</i></font>

418
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Noooooo!</i></font>

419
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be like that!  Listen to me!</font>

420
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

421
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just think about this, Luffy.</font>

422
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you think will happen
if you just go wild on Fishman Island?</font>

423
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whenever fishmen have tried to open their hearts to humans, the humans have only worked against them.</font>

424
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Humans are brutal creatures."
"Humans discriminate against fishmen and hate them."</font>

425
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The harsh reality of the situation is that history has taught fishmen to see things in a negative light.</font>

426
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even in the case of Arlong,</font>

427
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:10,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">more than a few of us think that humans hunted him down just because he was a fishman.</font>

428
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if you, the very same people who defeated Arlong,</font>

429
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were to attack Hody as well, what would happen?</font>

430
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you saved Fishman Island from this crisis...</font>

431
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they'd see you attack Hody,
who is taking a stand against humanity.</font>

432
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will just remind them of Fishman Island's history,
and convince them that things will never change.</font>

433
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you say, but Jinbe...</font>

434
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's natural for us to want
to save our captured companions,</font>

435
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and if we leave things the way they are,
then Fishman Island will fall under Hody's control.</font>

436
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got many friends here on this island.</font>

437
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Hachi.</font>

438
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You seem determined not to tell us
who gave you those wounds,</font>

439
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but you also said...</font>

440
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that Hody will even attack fishmen
who want to be friends with humans, right?</font>

441
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

442
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">were attacked because you stood up for us, weren't you?</font>

443
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi...</font>

444
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin...</font>

445
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that true?  Did Hody and his men do this to you?!</font>

446
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

447
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe.  To Luffy, knowing that this is your country
just gives him another reason to fight.</font>

448
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't just leave this island behind.</font>

449
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have a reason to fight.</font>

450
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all...</font>

451
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Caimie-chan is here!</i></font>

452
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shirahoshi-chan is here too!</i></font>

453
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Indeed!  This country is the Mermaid Paradise
of my dreams!</i></font>

454
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way, Jinbe.</font>

455
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said I'm going, so I'm going.</font>

456
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let you!  Leave this to me!</font>

457
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why, you!  I'll just have to send you flying and then go!</i></font>

458
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you won't listen to what I say,
I'll stand up to you as many times as I must!</i></font>

459
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What was that?!</i></font>

460
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you two!</font>
