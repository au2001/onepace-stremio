<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're flying away!</font>

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What the...?!</font>

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that guy?!</font>

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no time to get distracted.</font>

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that's my leg!</font>

71
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then whose leg is that?!</font>

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat this!</font>

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's already this bad?</font>

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,700

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, man...</font>

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're overdoing it, Captain...</font>

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, these guys aren't half bad.</font>

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They sure are impatient...</font>

84
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what happened to you, Straw Hat?</font>

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're ruining the mood.</font>

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I guess we've pretty much ruined their formation now.</font>

88
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Commodore, it seems all the pirates have come out of the auction house.</font>

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're planning to run away!</font>

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, these brats shouldn't underestimate us!</font>

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our reinforcements are on their way!</font>

92
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotten the three hostages out through the back door.</font>

93
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aim the mortar cannons at the people who don't have abilities!</font>

94
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Firing squad, get behind them!</font>

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All forces, prepare to attack!</font>

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take out these pirates!</font>

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here they come.</font>

98
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The enemy seems to have run out of strategies.</font>

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now it's just a brawl.</font>

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back to normal!</font>

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, see ya later, Straw Hat.</font>

102
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a pleasure meeting you in person...</font>

103
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I won't show you any mercy the next time we meet!</font>

104
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'll be the one who finds One Piece!</font>

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Kid!</font>

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you just standing around for?!</font>

107
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Killer.</font>

108
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the route that we took to get here...</font>

109
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whenever we said we were gonna find One Piece, people just laughed at us...</font>

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I killed anyone who dared to laugh...</font>

111
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But after this...</font>

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we're going to an ocean where anyone who doesn't have the guts to say it will die.</font>

113
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's meet again in the New World!</font>

114
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, you guys!</font>

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

116
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trafalgar Law!</font>

117
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you do that to my mate back then?!</font>

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bepo.</font>

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

120
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, are you going back there?</font>

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Sanji!</font>

122
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, look over there!</font>

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

124
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young master and friends!</font>

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flying Fish guys!</font>

126
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

127
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you just say I'm handsome?</font>

128
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, we're all set to go!</font>

129
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't we, men?</font>

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

131
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Life is rosy!</font>

132
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not too happy about relying on those guys again,</font>

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I guess we've got to hurry.</font>

134
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's go!</font>

135
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no choice!</font>

136
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lullaby Parry</font>

137
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two of you, hurry and go while you have the chance!</font>

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't fall asleep!</font>

140
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you an ally of the pirates, you scum?!</font>

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, I'm not!</font>

142
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't even a pirate!</font>

143
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neuve Fleurs</font>

144
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Nine flowers</i></font>

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

146
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Twist</font>

147
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T'was scary...!</font>

148
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Head!</font>

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was traumatized back when Navy HQ tried to kill him, and yet...</font>

150
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He endured it, huh?</font>

151
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's amazing!</font>

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shaddup!</font>

153
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think this be the right time to be talkin' about traumas and stuff like that?</font>

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to help the young masters, whom I owe my life to, out of this pinch!</font>

155
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man, Franky, go on ahead!</font>

156
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, thanks!</font>

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them get away!</font>

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many of them are there, anyway?!</font>

159
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My blood is boiling!</font>

160
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sure are an energetic old man!</font>

161
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hurry up, the three of you!</font>

162
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

163
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let the Straw Hat Crew get away!</font>

164
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're responsible for all this!</font>

165
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shoot them! Shoot them!!!</font>

166
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

167
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thunderbolt Tempo</font>

168
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Saint Rosward's slave!</font>

169
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How'd he get those chains off?</font>

170
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wanna come with me,</font>

171
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">pirate, Captain Jean Bart?</font>

172
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been a long time since anyone called me that!</font>

173
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as it means that you'll free me from the Celestial Dragons,</font>

174
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll gladly become your subordinate!</font>

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should save half of that graditude for the Straw Hats.</font>

176
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're still following us, even after we destroyed the bridge...</font>

177
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course they are.</font>

178
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines will probably be there when we return to the city, too.</font>

179
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry and get off the island.</font>

180
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kid!</font>

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chief Kid!</font>

182
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up there.</font>

183
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be...</font>

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why...</font>

185
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are you on this island?!</font>

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a quick witted bear!</font>

187
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't even touch him!</font>

188
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can a bear speak?!</font>

189
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry...</font>

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's too sensitive!</font>

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, Bepo!</font>

192
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They destroyed the bridge!</font>

194
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're new, so you're my subordinate.</font>

195
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as I'm not a slave, anything is fine!</font>

196
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, look at that!</font>

197
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eustass and...</font>

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...!</font>

199
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's one of the Seven Warlords doing in a place like this?!</font>

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trafalgar Law...</font>

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you know my name?</font>

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

203
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're right next to Navy HQ and Mariejoa...</font>

204
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wouldn't be strange running into anyone here.</font>

205
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines are coming at us from behind!</font>

206
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy isn't gonna let us pass, is he?</font>

207
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trafalgar, you're in my way!</font>

208
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You want me to kill you?</font>

209
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you not to order me around, didn't I?</font>

210
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm running into a lot of big shots today...</font>

211
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna meet an admiral on top of all this, so...</font>

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shall make you let us pass...</font>

213
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Bartholomew Kuma!</font>

214
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,790
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Grove 8 


















Hound Pets Hideout</font>

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you alive, Peterman-san?!</font>

216
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could they do this to our boss?!</font>

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

218
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

219
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought Duval would look 
so handsome under his iron mask!</font>

220
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, if you ever need anything, just call me!</font>

221
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll be your arms and legs until you're ready to go to Fishman Island!</font>

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure!</font>

223
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot, you guys!</font>

224
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mention it.</font>

225
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop winking already.</font>

226
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also...</font>

227
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This belongs to the mermaid, right?</font>

228
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My backpack!</font>

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That idiot, Peterman had it.</font>

230
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

231
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's go, Rosy-life riders!</font>

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Handrosy!</font>

233
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've got quite a few different names for him, huh?</font>

234
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're probably still trying to find a good one.</font>

235
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry and get inside.</font>

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got to stabilize Hachi!</font>

237
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Shakki!</font>

238
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're back!</font>

239
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Ray-san, welcome back.</font>

240
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was fast.</font>

241
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm really impressed that you guys found him, Monkey-chan.</font>

242
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi is badly injured, so we've got to get him to the bed fast.</font>

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

244
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind, I'll get a bed ready for him.</font>

245
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

246
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the pirate king's ship?!</font>

247
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

248
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the vice-captain.</font>

249
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Silvers Rayleigh.</font>

250
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nice to meet you.</font>

251
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vice-captain?!</font>

252
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't tell them, Hacchan?</font>

253
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We only needed him to coat the ship...</font>

254
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you didn't notice?</font>

255
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I totally know that name!</font>

256
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's written down in so many books...</font>

257
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's definitely a name everyone's heard at least once...</font>

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gold Roger?</font>

259
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There might have been a rookie 
by that name, or maybe there wasn't...</font>

260
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How does that octopus know a big shot like you?</font>

261
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Hachi helped me out once when I was stranded at sea over 20 years ago.</font>

262
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He saved his life.</font>

263
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was just a child at the time, though.</font>

264
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi and I used to get along pretty well before he joined the Sun Pirates.</font>

265
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong's crew, right?</font>

266
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

267
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Gold Roger was executed 22 years ago...</font>

268
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come you, the vice-captain, are still alive?</font>

269
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your crew was captured by the navy, right?</font>

270
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We weren't captured.</font>

271
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger surrendered to them.</font>

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose the government claimed that they'd "captured" him, to show their power.</font>

273
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate King surrendered?!</font>

274
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

275
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He could see the end of our journey.</font>

276
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was probably about four years before he was executed...</font>

277
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger caught an incurable disease.</font>

278
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

279
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a disease that nobody could cure or stabilize.</font>

280
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Roger suffered from it, but...</font>

281
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But one man, the most well-known doctor of his time...</font>

282
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man called Crocus of the Twin Capes, had the skill to ease his suffering.</font>

283
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We asked him for help, and he joined as the ship's doctor for our last journey.</font>

284
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then, three years later, while holding off Roger's disease...</font>

285
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did what they said was impossible, and conquered the Grand Line.</font>

286
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-C-Crocus-san?!</font>

287
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the Twin Capes...</font>

288
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, how nostalgic!</font>

289
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

290
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought that old man had been at those capes for fifty years!</font>

291
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he was part of the Pirate King's crew?</font>

292
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to think of it, he did say he'd been a ship's doctor for a while.</font>

293
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So he was a pirate for those three years?</font>

294
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you met him, then that must mean that he's still well.</font>

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crocus only had one condition...</font>

296
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That we let him look for a certain pirate crew whom he wanted to find.</font>

297
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook!</font>

298
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That must mean he went off to sea to look for you guys!</font>

299
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Crocus-san even did something like that for us?</font>

300
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was only a crew member for three years...</font>

301
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But he was, without a doubt, our comrade.</font>

302
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At my age, I would really like to see him again.</font>

303
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what happened after you conquered the sea?</font>

304
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that...</font>

305
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger became known all over the world as the Pirate King.</font>

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like he'd been called the Pirate King all along.</font>

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Titles like that didn't mean much for a man on the verge of death...</font>

308
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, Roger was happy about it.</font>

309
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was a man who loved doing everything in grand style...</font>

310
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be it celebrations or battles...</font>

311
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though he knew he wouldn't live much longer, he seemed to enjoy himself...</font>

312
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eventually, at the captains orders, the Roger Pirates disbanded.</font>

313
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We all went our separate ways, and one after another, everyone disappeared.</font>

314
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no idea what our comrades whom we risked our lives with are now, nor what they are doing.</font>

315
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, one year after the crew dissolved...</font>

316
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger turned himself in and was arrested.</font>

317
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was decided that he would be executed in the town he was born in...</font>

318
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Loguetown in East Blue.</font>

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hear that on that day...</font>

320
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Countless pirates who are famous today...</font>

321
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were gathered in the square.</font>

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate King's execution was the center of attention for the world.</font>

323
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't go.</font>

324
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These were the last words he said to me...</font>

325
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm not gonna die, partner.</i></font>

326
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure both the world government and the navy were surprised.</font>

327
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They had intended for the execution to be a warning to all the pirates who saw it...</font>

328
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Roger's last words raised the curtain on the Great Pirate Era!</font>

329
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My treasures?</i></font>

330
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you want them, they're yours!</i></font>

331
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Look for them!</i></font>

332
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I left it all at that place.</i></font>

333
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just a few seconds before the flame of his life went out, it flickered...</font>

334
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he turned it into a blazing flare that covered the entire world.</font>

335
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never laughed as hard as I did that night.</font>

336
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never cried as much as I did that night...</font>

337
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nor have I ever drank as much as I did that night.</font>

338
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He led a marvelous life as my captain!</font>

339
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like we just heard quite the story...</font>

340
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sounds like a completely different story coming from someone who was involved...</font>

341
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, it's almost as though Roger intended to start this pirate-era!</font>

342
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't say anything for sure about that.</font>

343
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roger died.</font>

344
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ones creating the current era are those who live right now.</font>

345
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure there were a lot of people who received something from Roger in the square that day.</font>

346
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shanks, whom you know well, was one of them.</font>

347
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pops, you know Shanks?</font>

348
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're from East Blue, then maybe you know a pirate named Buggy as well?</font>

349
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Buggy!</font>

350
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those two were swabbies aboard our ship.</font>

351
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shanks was on the pirate king's ship?!</font>

352
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, he didn't tell you?</font>

353
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was about ten years ago...</font>

354
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I encountered him by chance on this island...</font>

355
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'd lost his trademark straw hat and his left arm.</font>

356
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I asked him why, he excitedly started telling me about you.</font>

357
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Rayleigh-san, I was really surprised...</i></font>

358
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>There was a kid in East Blue who said the exact same thing Captain Roger said.</i></font>

359
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Those exact same words as the captain!</i></font>

360
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,860
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Sabaody Archipelago


















Grove 27</font>

361
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see a warship approaching the port!</font>

362
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The admiral has arrived!</font>

363
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, Kizaru here.</font>

364
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've arrived.</font>

365
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Requesting a response.</font>
