140
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We told you we can't fly like this!</font>

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Little People! I'll pay you back for this!</font>

144
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Am I... flying?!</font>

145
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,530

146
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm falling! I'm falling! I'm falling!</font>

147
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,530

151
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right! And land on it smoothly!</font>

152
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now! Kick off!</font>

153
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm flying!</font>

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kicking off rooftops helps you to rise!</font>

155
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!</font>

156
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting the knack of it!</font>

163
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,360

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got it!</font>

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! So please keep Senor busy like that!</font>

170
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got it!</font>

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you send String-Joker off somewhere?</font>

180
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to deliver something but I guess he doesn't need it.</font>

181
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys...</font>

183
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was nuts!</font>

184
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even his eyes were crazy...</font>

185

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He looked like me when I was a kid.</font>

187
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sensed he would become my right-hand man in 10 years or so.</font>

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame that I will have to kill him with my own hands.</font>

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have an intruder!</font>

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch him!
He has explosives strapped to his body!</font>

191
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Who the hell is this kid?!
Who let him in?!</font>

192
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me join your pirate group.</font>

193
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,810

I wanna destroy them all!</font>

206
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you send Dellinger to kill me?!
Was it really your order?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't make me say it straight, Bellamy.</font>

211
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your purpose was different from mine.
From long ago.</font>

212
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You always wanted to become a pirate.</font>

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But not me.</font>

214
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anything was fine with me.</font>

215

It's over already.</font>

229
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are these bulging stones?</font>

230
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That place is dangerous.</font>

231
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,740

254
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not your fault.</font>

255
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything happened because of Doflamingo's meddling!</font>

256
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta bring an end to this game somehow...</font>

257
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

258
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,940

259
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's with the Five-star God Usopp!</font>

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright... Let's do it!</font>

261
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we only capture them!</font>

262
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay?</font>

263
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, if we don't do it, this game will last until we die!</font>

264
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, take King Riku and God Usopp as hostages.</font>

265

353
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, pops,
why did you take off before I knew it?</font>

354
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever the situation is...
What I have to do is...</font>

355
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...bring down Doflamingo
and take back the country!</font>

356
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there's one more thing!</font>

357
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's one man in the Family's Top Executives that I wanna kill with my own bare hands at any cost!</font>

358
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old dude, you're not willing to die, are you?</font>

359
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! I won't be defeated with this human body!</font>

360
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, then!</font>

361
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nothing's alright! Get off!</font>

362
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! You get off!</font>

363
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's nonsense! You're the worst!</font>

364
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are part of the Worst Generation!</font>

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch out, fool!
Look where you're going! Hey!</font>

366
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said, don't tell me what to do!</font>

367
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

368
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that...</font>

369

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go ahead, Straw Hat!</font>

370
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna keep them busy!</font>

371
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What-in?! They're suddenly...</font>

372
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were disorganised before, fighting each other!</font>

373
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Why are you doing this, guys?!</font>

374
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am Dagama, the military technician!
This is war!</font>

375
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if we all run wild blindly, no one can reach the top!</font>

376
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't trust Dagama but I agreed to his plan to keep the Executives here and let Straw Hat go ahead!</font>

377
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave this mess here to us and go!</font>

378
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure to take him there, Cavendish!</font>

379
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,730

380
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,960

381
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Way to go!</font>

382
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,480
