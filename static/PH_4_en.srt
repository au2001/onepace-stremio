26
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,690

29
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You had plenty of time to fight back, Luffy!</font>

30
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you kept on saying such dumb things.</font>

31
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... you should be more careful what...</font>

40
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sharks!  Why are there sharks in the lake?!</i></font>

41
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool!  This is technically the ocean!</font>

42
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This hole was ground zero of the fight
between Aokiji and Akainu.</font>

43
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cracks tore right through the island,
so sea water flowed in and made this lake!</font>

44
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course there are ocean creatures here!</font>

45
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

46
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sharks!  Scary!  Sharks!</font>

47
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro got eaten by sharks!</font>

48
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aim carefully!  They can't do anything now!</font>

49
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're everywhere!  We're doomed!</font>

50
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blast them to smithereens!</font>

51
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!  I never imagined my life would end like this!</font>

52
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the end!</font>

53
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

54
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  What happened?!</font>

55
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

56
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most frigid of winds,</font>

57
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">cuts colder than the arctic.</font>

58
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feel the underworld.</font>

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, you filth!</font>

60
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I did not have time to warn you.</font>

61
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I froze your gunbarrels...</font>

62
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so if you shoot, they will explode in your faces!</font>

63
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you, skeleton-mask?!</font>

64
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are unworthy to hear my name.</font>

65
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Brook.</font>

66
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You still told it to me?</font>

67
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I returned from the underworld,</font>

68
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and dedicated my second life
to my captain with the straw hat!</font>

69
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am known as the Soul King!</font>

70
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When did he pull that trick with our guns?!</font>

71
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let you get away with this, you damn-</font>

72
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Won't let you get away with this?"</font>

73
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's <i>my</i> line!</font>

74
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you!</font>

75
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you?!</font>

76
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not lose my crewmates a second time!</font>

77
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only ice!</font>

78
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn he's fast!  He's too strong!</font>

79
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sharks have all been killed!</font>

80
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Where did they go?!</font>

81
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here!</font>

82
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You came at a perfect time, Brook.</font>

83
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you're alright!</font>

84
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As it happens, I was chased here by a strange fellow...</font>

85
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've really done it now,
you half-man half-beast freaks!</font>

86
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think my training was so weak...</font>

87
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that I'd die to something as trivial as sharks?!</font>

88
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... the human body... can't train against the cold...</font>

89
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Freezing... I'm turning into ice!</font>

90
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you... you guys...</font>

91
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that trying to cross the frozen lands...</font>

92
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in these clothes...</font>

93
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But look... We're in luck.</font>

94
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should be thankful... that we met them.</font>

95
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss!  We won't let them take another step!</font>

96
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!  There's something familiar about these guys!</font>

97
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one will do...</font>

98
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going with the fourth guy from the right!</font>

99
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've decided...  I'll take the one next to him!</font>

100
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take that one...</font>

101
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one that girl at the far left is wearing...</font>

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they saying?</font>

103
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those clothes look so warm!</font>

104
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, go!</font>

105
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get one for me, too!</font>

106
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they... coming for our coats?!</font>

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How crude!  What are they, highwaymen?</font>

108
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I remember!  It's that hat!</font>

109
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one of the rookies
from the Worst Generation two years ago!</font>

110
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right... He's Fire-Fist's little brother!</font>

111
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirate worth four hundred million, Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

112
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>F-Four hundred million?!</i></font>

113
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

114
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

115
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way, children!</font>

116
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta find the back door!</font>

117
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

118
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go back!</font>

119
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was that man!  It was he who cut me down!</font>

120
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Really?!</font>

121
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So does he have your body?</font>

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... he most likely does not, however...</font>

123
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then this can wait until later!</font>

124
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait!  He might know something!</font>

125
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our first priority is to find a backdoor!
We're not going back to meet the Navy!</font>

126
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The samurai was with them.</font>

127
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

128
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let the Straw Hats escape, either.</font>

129
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like some sort of thin film or something.</font>

131
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?  It felt weird...</font>

132
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's not important right now!</font>

133
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now hurry and run, damn kids!</font>

134
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Did I drop my cigarette?</font>

135
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me!</font>

136
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,650
