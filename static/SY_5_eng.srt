<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36" color="#d6d6d6">This way!</font>

127
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He sure knows how to talk big...</font>

128
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He basically just told 'em
to run away...</font>

129
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The woods are like our backyard!</font>

130
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">O-Okay...</font>

131
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Jango!</font>

132
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I wound up gawking!</font>

133
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The fools!</font>

134
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They can't possibly escape me–</font>

135
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Howdya like that?!</font>

136
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn you!</font>

137
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go after them, you fool!</font>

138
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Y-Yeah, okay!</font>

139
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How pointless...</font>

140
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I know very well just
how weak Kaya is...</font>

141
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">She'll never escape Jango...</font>

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you want to help her,
go right ahead.</font>

143
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you can get past this
hill alive, that is.</font>

144
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Buchi!</font>

145
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You already lost to me once!</font>

146
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I told you not to get in my way!</font>

147
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Move!</font>

148
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is that hypnotist still behind us?!</font>

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nope, I don't see him!</font>

150
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's lose him for good!</font>

151
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Like he can really catch
us inside this forest!</font>

152
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Don't worry, Kaya-san!}Don't worry, Miss Kaya!</font>

153
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We <i>will</i> keep you safe!</font>

154
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! In the name
of the Usopp Pirates!</font>

155
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thank you...</font>

156
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Not there...</font>

157
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where are you, you runts?!</font>

158
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't think you can escape me!</font>

159
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can shave this whole
forest bald, if you'd like!</font>

160
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Whoa! He seems <i>really</i> mad!</font>

161
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's not just a hypnotist?!</font>

162
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where did you run off to?</font>

163
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This way!</font>

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What's that sound?!</font>

165
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who knows?</font>

166
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Jango is probably tearing the place up.</font>

167
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why not go and see for yourself?</font>

168
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Though it may already be too late...</font>

169
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn you...!</font>

170
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't you even have a shred of pity?!</font>

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You lived with her for three years!</font>

172
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No.</font>

173
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I already told you, Kaya is nothing
more than a pawn in my plan.</font>

174
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Once she's dead, <i>then</i> I'll
express some gratitude.</font>

175
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn you...!</font>

176
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a helplessly evil guy!</font>

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I don't plan to help him, though!</font>

178
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go to them!</font>

180
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll take over here!</font>

181
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Leave it to us!</font>

182
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh? You can still move?
How impressive.</font>

183
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Shut up...!</font>

184
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I refuse to let you...</font>

185
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">have your way!</font>

186
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You went and betrayed the villagers'
and Kaya's feelings...</font>

187
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I refuse to let you have
your way anymore!</font>

188
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Usopp!</font>

189
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">D-Dammit...</font>

190
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I... can't move...</font>

191
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You really are a riot!</font>

192
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Just stay on the ground there.</font>

193
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Though, even if you did
catch up with Jango,</font>

194
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you'd be no match for him anyway.</font>

195
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This way is probably safest for you!</font>

196
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even if I <i>am</i> no match...</font>

197
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:53,170
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Even if I <i>am</i> no match for him...
I <i>will</i> protect them!</font>

198
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:59,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm captain of the Usopp Pirates
and a brave warrior of the sea!</font>

199
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:08,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I won't let you lay
a finger on the village!</font>

200
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's with him?</font>

201
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's yellin' somethin'!</font>

202
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Check it out, he's cryin'!</font>

203
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's so funny?!</font>

204
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy!</font>

205
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Me and Usopp are gonna chase
that hypno-freak! That a problem?!</font>

206
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Nope! Hurry!</font>

207
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-Thanks...</font>

208
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'd actually be much faster by myself,</font>

209
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">but they're inside some woods.</font>

210
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm gonna need your directions
to catch up to him.</font>

211
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hold it, you two.</font>

212
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who gave you permission
to pass this hill?</font>

213
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>I</i> did!</font>

214
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Go! Zoro! Usopp!</font>

215
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And another!</font>

216
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum...</font>

217
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Spear!</font>

218
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Darn! He disappeared again!</font>

219
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh, well! They're past the hill, at least!</font>

220
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Before fighting, I have
one thing to ask you.</font>

221
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why is an outsider like you butting
into this village's business?!</font>

222
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Because there's a man in this village
I don't wanna let die!</font>

223
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How simple.</font>

224
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Are you okay with that
being why <i>you</i> die?!</font>

225
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yep! I'm not gonna die, though!</font>

226
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll make sure you do!</font>

227
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Gum-Gum...</font>

228
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Whip!</font>

229
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And Pistol!</font>

230
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're making me yawn!</font>

231
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why, you...!</font>

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! East! East! I said east!</font>

233
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Like I know where that is!
Tell me left or right!</font>

234
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then, turn right!</font>

235
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's the opposite way!</font>

236
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where did you run off to?</font>

237
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Kaya-san!}Miss Kaya!</font>

238
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm sorry... You run on ahead...</font>

239
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What are you saying?!</font>

240
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Our mission is to protect <i>you</i>!</font>

241
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oh no! She's got a really bad fever!</font>

242
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Eh?! Hang in there, Kaya-san!}What?! Hang in there, Miss Kaya!</font>

243
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">A doctor...! Get a doctor!</font>

244
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You idiot! This is no time for that!</font>

245
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Someone's trying to kill her!</font>

246
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But it's dangerous for
her to run any more!</font>

247
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But...</font>

248
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where are you, you runts?!</font>

249
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{I won't let Kaya-san die!}I won't let Miss Kaya die!</font>

250
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright then! Prepare
yourselves, Usopp Pirates!</font>

251
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Alright!</font>

252
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's fight him!</font>

253
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No!</font>

254
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're still just children!</font>

255
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You mustn't die for my sake!</font>

256
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're not gonna die.</font>

257
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're gonna fight to live!</font>

258
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Damn...</font>

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He cut my mouth...</font>

260
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That straw hat guy's
insanely strong, and yet...</font>

261
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-That's Captain Kuro for ya!</font>

262
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get 'im!</font>

263
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hurray for Captain Kuro!</font>

264
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Captain Kuro!</font>

265
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're awesome, Captain Kuro!</font>

266
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't call me by that name!</font>

267
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you still not get it?!</font>

268
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This plan is so I can be completely
rid of the name "Captain Kuro"!</font>

269
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm tired...</font>

270
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Devising plans everyday for you men
who only care about mayhem...</font>

271
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Being relentlessly attacked by
government dogs and bounty hunters...</font>

272
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was absolutely sick of it all!</font>

273
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{\an8}The Marines, huh...?</font>

276
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It can't be helped.</font>

277
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We're doing stuff that
makes people chase us.</font>

278
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Plus you've made quite
a name for yourself...</font>

279
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes... That name is what
draws them to us.</font>

280
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,100

282
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But it's no use.</font>

292
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,260

Should we blast 'em back?!</font>

295

299
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah, I know.</font>

300
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"You know"?!</font>

301
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's way too reckless for him
to go there by himself!</font>

302

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-The Marines...</font>

312
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They've been wiped out!</font>

313
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now, then...</font>

316
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I was kind enough to leave
you alive, you know...</font>

317
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Sh-Shut up...</font>

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I-I'm not gonna beg for my life...</font>

319
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,170

320
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's a good look.</font>

321
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you can howl that much with
a shattered jaw, then that's perfect!</font>

322
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm giving you, a nameless,
low-ranking soldier, a treat.</font>

323
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Accept it gratefully...</font>

324
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The head of Kuro,
Man of a Thousand Plans!</font>

325
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Your name is Captain Kuro...
Your name is Captain Kuro.</font>

326
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This atrocity was your doing.</font>

327
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,380
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One, two, Jango!</font>

328
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My name is Captain Kuro.
This atrocity was my doing.</font>

329
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And <i>you're</i> the man who
caught Captain Kuro.</font>

330
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Return to base and execute this man.</font>

331
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">One, two, Jango!</font>

332
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'm the man who caught Captain Kuro!</font>

333
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're doing it again, Vice Captain!</font>

334
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Perfect...</font>

335
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:09,580
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><font color="#040504">With that fake gone, Captain Kuro
will disappear from the world.</font></font>

336
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:17,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And when my plan today succeeds,
my goal will be fully achieved...</font>

337
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Money and peace of mind will be mine.</font>

338
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Do you understand, boy?</font>

339
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I cannot allow this plan
of three years to fail!</font>

340
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My plan will <i>not</i> be disrupted!</font>

341
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Seems you can do
more than just stretch!</font>

342
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right! I've toughened
myself up to be a pirate!</font>

343
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're "tired"?!</font>

344
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're not fit to be a pirate if having
a name on the seas scares you!</font>

345
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">My ambition is much
greater than yours!</font>

346
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-That guy...</font>

347
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He broke Captain Kuro's cat claw!</font>

348
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That leaves only five more
of those weird swords!</font>

349
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's okay! He can still fight plenty!</font>

350
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! He still has the other claw!</font>

351
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Scratch him up
and kill 'im, Captain Kuro!</font>

352
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! That name is taboo now!</font>

353
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I think his name in this village
is Klaha... something...</font>

354
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Kla-san, then!}Mr. Klah, then!</font>

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">all of you!</font>

358
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh?!</font>

359
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We got him! Now!</font>

360
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Take this!</font>

361
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pepper Attack!</font>

362
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Push...
– Push...</font>

363
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Hyaaah!
– Hyaaah!</font>

364
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Oww! Oww! Oww!</font>

365
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">End of the line, hypnotist!</font>

366
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't get cocky!</font>

367
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Darn it! We failed!</font>

368
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You made a mockery of me.</font>

369
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But I <i>am</i> a pirate...</font>

370
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">– Tamanegi!
– Tamanegi!</font>

371
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You pretend pirates have
interfered a bit too much...{"pirate brats" pretty sure}</font>

372
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Where are you hiding, Miss?!</font>

373
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll start by executing these three.</font>

374
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can reflect on your foolishness
to meddle in a real pirate fight...</font>

375
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,270
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">in the next life.</font>

376
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">There you are.</font>

377
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No!</font>

378
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">{Run, Kaya-san!}Run, Miss Kaya!</font>

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey!</font>

380
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah! That's them!</font>

381
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">They're the other way?!</font>

382
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll come exterminate
every one of you later...</font>

383
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Jango too, of course!</font>

384
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-Why us?!</font>

385
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please stop joking around,
Captain Kuro!</font>

386
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's still not too late for us
to attack the village, right?!</font>

387
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">And if Captain Jango gets her to write
her will, the plan should work!</font>

388
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You need not worry about this plan;</font>

389
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">your corpses will be enough for me
to place the blame on you.</font>

390
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I never intended to let you leave
this village from the start...</font>

391
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I can't have people who
know I exist stay alive.</font>

392
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You can't be serious!</font>

393
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Then you planned to kill
us from the very start?!</font>

394
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right...</font>

395
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Since three years ago, when I was
still known as Captain Kuro...</font>

396
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It was all...</font>

397
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36"><i>all</i> part of my plan!</font>

398
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Man, you guys are dumb.</font>

399
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're such an uncool pirate group!</font>

400
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">"Uncool"?</font>

401
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Pirate groups are nothing more than
a collection of social outcasts!</font>

402
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Without plans, what can
they possibly do?!</font>

403
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Every last one should just
shut up and follow my plans!</font>

404
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Crew members are loyal
pawns of the captain!</font>

405
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Whether my men live or die is all
up to my orders as their leader!</font>

406
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No matter how powerful the obstacle,
they simply need to stand up to it...</font>

407
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">and die for my plan.</font>

408
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">This is how pirates are!</font>

409
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't you talk down
to me, traveler boy!</font>

410
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">No matter how many
hundreds or thousands...</font>

411
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">of men follow you as their captain...</font>

412
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">you'll never be better than Usopp!</font>

413
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

414
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're saying I'm inferior to a kid
pretending to be a pirate captain?</font>

415
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">That's right!</font>

416
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You're hilarious!</font>

417
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Don't get cocky just because
you snapped one of my claws!</font>

418
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How exactly is he better
than me?! Let's hear it!</font>

419
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Character.</font>

420
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

421
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You don't know what a true pirate is!</font>

422
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">H-He...</font>

423
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He kept up with the Pussy
Foot Maneuver's speed!</font>

424
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">How insulting...</font>

425
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:52,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">If you want to know about real
pirates that much, then I'll show you...</font>

426
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">that terror.</font>

427
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:01,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">The terror of a pirate who's been
face to face with death many times!</font>

428
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey! That stance! Is he...?!</font>

429
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's gonna use <i>that</i> technique?!</font>

430
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But he's only fighting one guy!</font>

431
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">But that's definitely it!</font>

432
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's planning to use
the Out of the Back Attack!</font>

433
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Isn't it bad for us to be here?!</font>

434
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He'll get <i>us</i>, too!</font>

435
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He plans to kill us, too!</font>

436
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He even said so earlier!</font>

437
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please stop, Captain Kuro!
Anything but that technique!</font>

438
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">We'll do anything you want!</font>

439
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please, Captain Kuro!</font>

440
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What's the big deal?</font>

441
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">He's only wobbling back and forth...</font>

442
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please stop, Captain Kuro!</font>

443
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Out of the Back Attack!</font>

444
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What a small haul...</font>

445
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I thought they'd have a little
more treasure than <i>that</i>...</font>

446
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Let's see, is the fight over by now?</font>

447
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Huh? Everyone's stopped...</font>

448
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Is it over?</font>

449
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Th-There it is!</font>

450
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Why over there?!</font>

451
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Not again!</font>

452
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now it's the wall!</font>

453
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please stop, Captain Kuro!</font>

454
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It's no use! He attacks at random
using his Pussy Foot Maneuver!</font>

455
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Because of his speed, not even
he knows what he's cutting!</font>

456
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,140
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">So many crew members
have fallen victim to–</font>

457
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Hey!</font>

458
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Wh-What's happening?!
People are suddenly being cut!</font>

459
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Show yourself, butler...</font>

460
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Who do you take your friends for?!</font>

461
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Luffy...</font>

462
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Found you!</font>

463
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Bastard!</font>

464
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You should've let yourself
be cut like a good boy!</font>

465
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Look!</font>

466
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Thanks to you, my adorable men
are left alive and in agony.</font>

467
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">It would've been better for them
to die in that attack!</font>

468
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Now what?</font>

469
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You look like you have
something to say...</font>

470
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yeah...</font>

471
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,580

473
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,750

<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Especially since...
you're going to die here,</font>

as I hack you up like raw fish...</font>

477
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Please stop this!</font>

478
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Leave them alone!</font>

479
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I'll write my will!</font>

525
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,720

526
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Looks like you're one step
too late, bellyband!</font>

527
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">I wouldn't say so!</font>

528
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Yes! That branch was in the way!</font>

529
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">What?!</font>

530

535
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">Get away!</font>

536
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="36">You guys have
