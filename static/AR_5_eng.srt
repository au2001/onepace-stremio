00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Say it!</font>

128
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let go of me!</font>

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami...</font>

130
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

131
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Th-That's Arlong's tattoo.</font>

132
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You...</font>

133
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami...</font>

134
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Look at this!
They gave me all this money.</font>

135
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And they say they'll buy 
me anything I want.</font>

136
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

137
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Unforgivable! Shameful!</font>

138
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I absolutely can't forgive you if you join those pirates!</font>

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And them, of all people!</font>

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Do you even know what
kind of people they are?!</font>

141
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So what?!</font>

142
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If living an honorable life gets me killed like Bell-mère,</font>

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">then I don't wanna live honorably!</font>

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't believe you.</font>

145
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bell-mère...</font>

146
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bell-mère died for us!</font>

147
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How can you just–</font>

148
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37" color="#d6d6d6">That's enough, Nojiko.</font>

149
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave, Nami!</font>

150
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Never step foot into this village again!</font>

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,200
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

152
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How could she be so foolish?</font>

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did she not see 
Bell-mère as her parent?!</font>

154
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No, that's not true.</font>

155
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami loved Bell-mère.</font>

156
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey,</font>

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">didn't Bell-mère say that we'd be happy someday, if we survive?</font>

158
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She said we'd be so happy.</font>

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah.</font>

160
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">After Arlong dragged me off,</font>

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">five naval ships came to capture him,</font>

162
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but Arlong easily sank them.</font>

163
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't think the government will
send any more help to this island.</font>

164
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,190
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's what made me realize
I have to do something.</font>

165
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,230
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I made an agreement with Arlong</font>

166
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">to buy Cocoyashi Village from him.</font>

167
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">To buy the village?</font>

168
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">For 100 million belly.</font>

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If I buy the village, we can be free.</font>

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No one else will have to die.</font>

171
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">In exchange, I have to join his
crew and draw sea charts.</font>

172
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">B-But, 100 million belly?</font>

173
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,500
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm not sure you can earn that
much working your entire life!</font>

174
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I will earn it!
No matter what it takes!</font>

175
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Everyone's working their hardest
to pay the tribute money,</font>

176
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so my only choice is to do it alone.</font>

177
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If I ask anyone for help,
more people will get hurt.</font>

178
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,440
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You know, it won't be easy.</font>

179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I know.</font>

180
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Staying with the people who
killed Bell-mère will hurt.</font>

181
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll be fine. I'll put on a big smile,
even when I look at him!</font>

182
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I've decided not to cry anymore.</font>

183
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I've decided to fight on my own!</font>

184
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami was only ten. Can you imagine how hard of a choice it was</font>

185
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">to fight and survive on her own?</font>

186
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">For the only deal that could 
save the village, she...</font>

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll make whoever makes my 
beloved Nami suffer–</font>

188
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-Why, Big Sister?</font>

189
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I told you! I came here 
to tell you to stop!</font>

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you make a big fuss
about her being your friend,</font>

191
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">the pirates'll grow suspicious of Nami.</font>

192
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Her eight years of struggle
will be all for nothing!</font>

193
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't make her suffer
any more than she already has.</font>

194
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She has to fight alone,
so the most painful thing for her</font>

195
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">is having people who
call her their friend!</font>

196
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,530
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>– Get back here, you damn brat!
– How dare you steal our treasure!</i></font>

197
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Stealing from pirates?!</i></font>

198
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

199
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I'm using the huge number of pirates
in this era to my advantage!</i></font>

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>It's like, "You get what you deserve!"</i></font>

201
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>You're covered in cuts, though!</i></font>

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Yeah. I sorta screwed up.</i></font>

203
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>But look at this! One million belly!</i></font>

204
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Forget about that!
We need to treat those cuts, quick!</i></font>

205
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I'm fine! It's nothing!</i></font>

206
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>No one will ever find it here!</i></font>

207
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I'll save my money here, little by little,</i></font>

208
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>and it'll be 100 million by the time it's full!</i></font>

209
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I have a long way to go.</i></font>

210
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A hundred million belly.</font>

211
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's taken a long time,
but I just need seven million more.</font>

212
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can earn that much now in one run!</font>

213
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just one more journey,
and it'll all be over.</font>

214
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,630
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Everyone in Cocoyashi Village
and I will be free of Arlong.</font>

215
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And then...</font>

216
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">And then, I think I can finally smile 
from the bottom of my heart.</font>

217
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Bell-mère.</font>

218
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What does the Navy want with Nami?</font>

219
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You simply need to keep quiet and lead the way.</font>

220
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why does that old guy have
a pinwheel on his head?</font>

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Guess I'll get started on
my final plunder run!</font>

222
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,320
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gen? And the Navy?</font>

223
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you the thief known as Nami?</font>

224
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Our information has it you've hidden
treasure you stole from pirates.</font>

225
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The government hereby confiscates
all the property you have stolen!</font>

226
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's the matter?
Did you not hear me?</font>

227
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The government hereby 
takes possession</font>

228
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">of everything you stole 
from the pirates.</font>

229
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">My, my. You're very passionate
about your duties, I see.</font>

230
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're not brave enough
to stand up to pirates,</font>

231
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so you deal with cat burglars
instead to earn brownie points.</font>

232
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Talk about noble!</font>

233
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here's a warning for you.</font>

234
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm an officer of the Arlong Pirates.</font>

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Mess with me,
and Arlong won't stand by quietly!</font>

236
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Silly girl. Do you think you're
dealing with me on equal footing?</font>

237
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Find the stolen goods!</font>

238
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wait!</font>

239
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop!</font>

240
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is this what the Navy 
should be doing right now?!</font>

241
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The Arlong Pirates have killed people,
and even destroyed towns!</font>

242
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You know that!</font>

243
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's ruling over this island and
trampling all over people's lives!</font>

244
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Is ignoring such a major problem</font>

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and snatching stolen goods from a thief</font>

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">what the government stands for?!</font>

247
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Watch how you speak to me.</font>

248
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Continue your search!</font>

249
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">People all over the island've been
waiting for your help for years now!</font>

250
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How dare you just pass
them by and come here!</font>

251
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Captain! This tangerine 
orchard seems suspicious!</font>

252
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dig it up!</font>

253
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,490
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Keep your filthy hands off of
Bell-mère's tangerine orchard!</font>

254
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I won't let you have my money!</font>

255
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That money's for...
That money's for...</font>

256
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,620
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Her money is meant
to save Cocoyashi Village!</font>

257
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What gives you the right to 
take it away, marine?!</font>

258
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh? A lowly village representative,
challenging a naval captain?</font>

259
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gen, how do you
know about that?</font>

260
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,060
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I've always known, Nami.</font>

261
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I couldn't believe 
what you did back then,</font>

262
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">so I confronted Nojiko later.</font>

263
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Everyone in the village
has known since then</font>

264
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">that you stayed with the Arlong Pirates so you could save the village.</font>

265
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We only pretended we didn't know.</font>

266
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We thought our hopes would keep you</font>

267
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">from running away from Arlong, 
if you ever decided to.</font>

268
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You can't be serious.</font>

269
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Whatever are you talking about?</font>

270
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're saying all 
the villagers are thieves,</font>

271
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">and we should arrest them?</font>

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's saying that each and every
one of us is fighting to live!</font>

273
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But only because we can't rely
on any of you government people!</font>

274
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you're not gonna save our village,
then get the hell out of here!</font>

275
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Dilly-dally, and Arlong'll go after your ship, too!</font>

276
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Mr. Arlong will?
I wouldn't be so sure.</font>

277
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You still haven't found it?!</font>

278
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're looking for 100 million
belly here! Not a grain of rice!</font>

279
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, you! How do you
know how much there is?!</font>

280
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,760
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh, the 100 million?</font>

281
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I just got the feeling there's that much.</font>

282
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't tell me he...</font>

283
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't tell me Arlong sent you here?!</font>

284
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Who knows?</font>

285
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're simply dealing with theft
as any civil servant would.</font>

286
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What rotten scum!</font>

287
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I can't believe the Navy would
stoop to being pirate cronies!</font>

288
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

289
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I found it!</font>

290
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is incredible!</font>

291
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm impressed a girl like you could gather this much!</font>

292
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,070
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's all ragged and stained with blood.</font>

293
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No matter! Money is money!</font>

294
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Thirty percent of this is all mine!</font>

295
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't touch that.</font>

296
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't touch that.
Don't touch that.</font>

297
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

298
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't touch that.
Don't touch that.</font>

299
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't touch that!</font>

300
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

301
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko!</font>

302
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,450
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko!</font>

303
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Doctor! Doctor!</font>

304
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What is it, Gen?!</font>

305
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– Nojiko's been shot!
– By who?!</font>

306
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The Navy!</font>

307
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The Navy?</font>

308
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko!</font>

309
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,680
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm fine.</font>

310
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong's been working with the Navy.</font>

311
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

312
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He's lied to Nami for 
the last eight years.</font>

313
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">He never intended to
honor their agreement!</font>

314
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,940
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– What?!
– Oh, no! Then...</font>

315
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,520
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That bastard!
He lied to our Nacchan!</font>

316
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nacchan!</font>

317
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami.</font>

318
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,410
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Heya, Nami! What's up?
Need help with anything?</font>

319
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Are you still here?!</font>

320
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This has nothing to do with you!
Leave the damn island already!</font>

321
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,550
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

322
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

323
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,220
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

324
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I'd die before I break an
agreement concerning money.</i></font>

325
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,690
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>It doesn't matter
how many years it takes.</i></font>

326
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I'll honor our agreement.</i></font>

327
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

328
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's her problem?</font>

329
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

330
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh? What's wrong,
skilled surveyor of ours?</font>

331
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,790
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What's with the angry look?</font>

332
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">The marines you have under
your control stole all my money!</font>

333
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What happened to dying before
breaking promises about money?!</font>

334
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Why?!</font>

335
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,310
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">When did I break our promise?</font>

336
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Don't play dumb!
You teamed up with the Navy to–</font>

337
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,020
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">When did I break our promise?
Let's hear it!</font>

338
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Damn you. Damn you! Damn you!</font>

339
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,040
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I see! So your money's been stolen?</font>

340
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">How unfortunate.</font>

341
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,840
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But an agreement is an agreement.</font>

342
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If you can't bring 100 million belly to me,</font>

343
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,930
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm afraid I can't give
you the village back.</font>

344
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,510
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You scum!</font>

345
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,360
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's only 100 million belly!
Just start saving up again!</font>

346
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Or are you gonna run out on me?</font>

347
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,740
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But if you do run away, 
I'll kill everyone in Cocoyashi Village.</font>

348
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,540
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Nami,</i></font>

349
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>we only pretended we didn't know.</i></font>

350
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>We thought our hopes would keep you</i></font>

351
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>from running away from Arlong,
if you ever decided to.</i></font>

352
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Oh? Finally running away, huh?</font>

353
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Shouldn't we chase after her?</font>

354
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Chase? What for? 
She won't run away.</font>

355
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">She could never abandon
the lives of the villagers.</font>

356
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You certainly do know
how to play dirty.</font>

357
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No way would I let</font>

358
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">such an exceptional surveyor as Nami go so easily.</font>

359
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But I'm not a heartless devil.</font>

360
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,090
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Once she's done surveying
all of the world's seas,</font>

361
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,050
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll give her her freedom!</font>

362
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That'll take decades!</font>

363
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,970
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Not even a hundred 
years'd be enough!</font>

364
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No more of this!
Take up your weapons!</font>

365
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let's fight!</font>

366
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gen! Everyone! 
Please! Don't be hasty!</font>

367
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You can't die! It'll all be over!</font>

368
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,290
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You have to survive,
or everything will end!</font>

369
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:28,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Eight years ago, we swore
not to throw away our lives!</font>

370
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">No matter how painful and insulting
it was to be ruled by them,</font>

371
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,010
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">we swore to fight the patient fight 
as long as Nami was cheerful!</font>

372
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,180
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But this is their answer!</font>

373
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,150
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now that our village's chance for
freedom is gone, we have no hope!</font>

374
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">More than that,</font>

375
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">we must make those fishmen pay</font>

376
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">for toying with that girl's kindness!</font>

377
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Any objections?!</font>

378
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,990
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Of course not! Let's go!</font>

379
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,870
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We were always fully ready
to fight at any time!</font>

380
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I refuse to let them rule 
over me any more!</font>

381
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wait, everyone!</font>

382
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,880
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nami!</font>

383
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just a little more!</font>

384
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just wait a little more!
I'll keep working hard!</font>

385
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,600
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'll save up the money again!</font>

386
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,720
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It'll be easy this time!</font>

387
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'm used to it! I'll be fine!
There's no need to worry at all!</font>

388
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This is nothing compared 
to back then!</font>

389
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,610
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>I don't want anyone else to die!</i></font>

390
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,700
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Everyone! I'm fine! I'm just fine!</font>

391
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You can stop now.</font>

392
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Even you know there's no point now.</font>

393
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,420
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You fought very well, carrying our 
lives on your back all this time.</font>

394
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Joining them must've been
even more painful for you</font>

395
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">than being cut through the heart.</font>

396
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You fought very well.</font>

397
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gen.</font>

398
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave the village now.</font>

399
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Gen?!</font>

400
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Do it, Nami.</font>

401
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Wh-What?!</font>

402
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">– Nacchan.
– Nami.</font>

403
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,330
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You're crafty, and you have your dream.</font>

404
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Nojiko! Everyone!</font>

405
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I won't let you go!</font>

406
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,460
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Stop it, everyone!</font>

407
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,470
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I don't want to see anyone
else get hurt by them!</font>

408
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You'll die, you know!</font>

409
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,560
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We know.</font>

410
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's no use!
We've made up our minds!</font>

411
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,160
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Get out of our way, Nami!</font>

412
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,950
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let's go, everyone!</font>

413
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,240
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Even if we can't win,</font>

414
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">let's show 'em what we're made of!</font>

415
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,080
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong!</font>

416
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong! Arlong!</font>

417
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong! Arlong!</font>

418
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,920
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong! Arlong! Arlong!</font>

419
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,340
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arlong! Arlong!</font>

420
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,130
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Arl–</font>

421
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy?</font>

422
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,110
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What do you want?!
You don't even know anything!</font>

423
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">You have no clue what's happened here for the past eight years!</font>

424
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,820
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. I don't know.</font>

425
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,660
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">This has nothing to do with you!</font>

426
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,120
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I told you to leave the damn island already!</font>

427
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,000
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah. You did.</font>

428
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave! I don't need you!</font>

429
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,210
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave! Leave! Leave! Leave!</font>

430
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave! Leave! Leave!</font>

431
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Leave!</font>

432
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy,</font>

433
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,400
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">help me!</font>

434
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Of course I will!</font>

435
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,800
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37"><i>Don't touch my treasure!</i></font>

436
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,300
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Luffy!</font>

437
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Let's go.</font>

438
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,480
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Yeah!</font>

439
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,570
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey! Are you guys alright?!</font>

440
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,650
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Did Arlong do this to you?!</font>

441
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,370
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Move aside.</font>

442
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,910
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We have business with the fishmen.</font>

443
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,250
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Now that we know the truth
about Big Sis Nami,</font>

444
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,960
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">we felt the only thing we 
can do was to defeat Arlong.</font>

445
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,710
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">So we challenged him.</font>

446
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,260
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">But we lost by a hair.</font>

447
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,640
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Sorry, but we're not letting
you through this door,</font>

448
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">seeing as you have
no hope for victory!</font>

449
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,350
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What?!</font>

450
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,770
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">We're waiting here for a group of men, you see!</font>

451
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,850
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">A group of men?</font>

452
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,730
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">I'd bet my life on it.
They will come!</font>

453
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,750
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Here they come!</font>

454
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,890
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">It's those guys?</font>

455
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,810
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Just who are they?</font>

456
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">If they can't handle them,</font>

457
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,980
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">then there's no hope
for not only this island,</font>

458
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,860
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">but for the future of
the entire East Blue!</font>

459
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,780
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Those four men are here to change our fate.</font>

460
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,030
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Burn their faces into your minds!</font>

461
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,590
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Move aside.</font>

462
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,390
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Hey, do you think those two idiots
were part of Zoro's group?</font>

463
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,430
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Zoro's? They seemed too weak for that.</font>

464
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,100
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">They're not even worth killing.</font>

465
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,900
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">That's for sure!</font>

466
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,830
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">What the hell?!</font>

467
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,670
<font face="Impress BT Pace" size="37">Which one of you is Arlong?!</font>
