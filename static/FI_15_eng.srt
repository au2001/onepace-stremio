64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,390

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I used to like you,

67
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,880

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought he left the island after he resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard that Princess Shirahoshi
had been kidnapped by Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Boss Jinbe rescue her?</font>

71
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we have everyone we need.</font>

72
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was much easier than I thought it would be.</font>

73
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, the only ones left are the Straw Hats, and I don't know what they'll do.</font>

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm guessing that they're at a loss,
looking for a way inside Ryuuguu Palace.</font>

75

on the ocean floor for the past month...</font>

78
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thirty thousand of them! {...Seriously? THIRTY THOUSAND in the past month? Is he really saying that an average of a thousand people travel to Fishman Island daily? :/}</font>

79
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And heavily armed fishmen, all seventy thousand of them!</font>

80
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't believe this!</font>

81
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've moved here from the closed-off Fishman District.</font>

82
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In all, we've got a hundred thousand outlaws!</font>

83
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are some women and children around the plaza, but they can't fight.</font>

84
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll take care of them after things have settled down.</font>

85
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, the number of human slaves
will rapidly grow soon!</font>

86
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But for now,
we have a hundred thousand new citizens!</font>

87
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ones who have disgraced our species
will be forced to surrender their houses to you.</font>

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die or run away... They should decide quickly!</font>

89
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're causing quite a ruckus out here in public.</font>

90
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How undignified.</font>

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shouldn't let yourself get carried away like this...</font>

92
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,120

95
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to say something to you,
since you seem to think you've already won.</font>

96
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly.</font>

97
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw that a certain man
would destroy Fishman Island...</font>

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in my predictions.</font>

99
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We might end up destroying it.</font>

100
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you saw me?</font>

101
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

102
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man I saw destroying the island...</font>

103
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

104
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you trying to say?</font>

105
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That it won't be you!</font>

106
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One thing is certain...</font>

107
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody holds the fate
of Fishman Island in their hands.</font>

108
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Hody, I know this much...</font>

109
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is not you.</font>

110
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see!  Madame's predictions are never wrong!</font>

111
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words,
the future where Hody reigns over this island...</font>

112
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has no chance of happening!</font>

113
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame Shyarly!</font>

114
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame!</font>

115
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could he?!</font>

116
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ridiculous.  What were you implying, Shyarly?</font>

117
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you trying to get back at me?!</font>

118
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm different from your brother.</font>

119
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True, when I was a kid, everyone in
Fishman District looked up to your brother, Arlong.</font>

120
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we have gained power!</font>

121
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By now, the mark of the Arlong Pirates is just an empty symbol to unite us.</font>

122
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong's name is completely unnecessary now!</font>

123
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only one who can crush this country down to its foundation, and recreate it...</font>

124
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is me!</font>

125
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have the power to do that!</font>

126
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold, the size of this mob!</font>

127
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my strength!</font>

128
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My plan has been in the works for ten years!</font>

129
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall I tell you...</font>

130
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who killed the beloved Queen of Ryuuguu Kingdom?</font>

131
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your beloved Otohime was killed...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by me! {WHAT A TWEEST!!!}</font>

133
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

134
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible!</font>

135
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then...</font>

136
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what about that human?</font>

137
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're fools for not realizing it!</font>

138
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A few days before that day ten years ago...</font>

139
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I don't know who you are,
but if the pay's good, I'll gladly take any job.</i></font>

140
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>For real?!</i></font>

141
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's half of your payment.</i></font>

142
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll give you the rest after you've finished the job.</i></font>

143
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Alright, I accept.</i></font>

144
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Even this is enough to keep me drinking for a while.</i></font>

145
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So?  What kind of job is it?</i></font>

146
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's an easy job.  Even a kid could do it.</i></font>

147
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>But you have to make sure that nobody notices you!</i></font>

148
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then, on that day...</font>

149
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Get back!  They're going up in flames! {Copy-paste from 546. Just this line. For some reason the rest of them appear to be different from that episode...}</i></font>

150
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Put out the flames!</i></font>

151
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Run!</i></font>

152
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Protect the Royal Family!</i></font>

153
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hurry and put out the flames!</i></font>

154
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Otohime-sama's been shot!</i></font>

155
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  Give me the rest of my money already!</i></font>

156
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I burned the signatures, just like I promised!</i></font>

157
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I won't bother you after this, so just give me the money!</i></font>

158
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's going on?!</i></font>

159
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You foolish human.</i></font>

160
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Damn it... Damn it to hell!</i></font>

161
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>A human... {Copy-paste from 547}</i></font>

162
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,780

163
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:33,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Queen Otohime's killer was human! {End copy-paste from 547}</i></font>

164
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody, you filth!</font>

165
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

166
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

167
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Hody!</font>

168
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!</font>

169
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She was quite a nuisance.</font>

170
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Shirahoshi?!</font>

171
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Claiming that revenge against humans was evil...</font>

172
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Preaching all around the island
that we should get along with humans...</font>

173
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that woman almost realized her dreams.
I hated every single thing about her!</font>

174
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, she was the kind of person whose influence wouldn't fade even if I killed her!</font>

175
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But to me, your mother...</font>

176
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was someone who just had to die!</font>

177
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!  Stop hurting the princess!</font>

178
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is too cruel!</font>

179
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew.</font>

180
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

181
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

182
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?  What happened?!</font>

183
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My heartache from being rejected will never fade.</font>

184
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-Wh-Wha?!</font>

185
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It started moving!</i></font>

186
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's going on?</font>

187
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

188
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I sent Noah flying straight toward Shirahoshi!</font>

189
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!</i></font>

190
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noah is half the size of Fishman Island itself!</font>

191
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means, if Noah collides with the island...</font>

192
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it won't just kill Shirahoshi,
it'll make the entire island crumble!</font>

193
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is nowhere to run or hide!</font>

194
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi will live in my heart for all time!</font>

195
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">May the entire island perish!</font>

196
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Farewell, my beloved Shirahoshi!</font>

197
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Farewell, Fishman Island!</font>

198
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You knew that I killed your mother?</font>

199
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What nonsense is this, Shirahoshi?!</font>

200
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!  Are you alright?</font>

201
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!</font>

202
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi...</font>

203
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A few years after the incident, Megalo told me in secret.</font>

204
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Megalo?</font>

205
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Megalo used to be the pet of the Neptune Army.</font>

206
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He saw everything that happened that day.</font>

207
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, why didn't you tell us,
Princess Shirahoshi?!</font>

208
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I did...</font>

209
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">people would probably end up hating Hody-sama.</font>

210
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happened, Mother would've been so sad.</font>

211
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was the final promise I made with my mother.</font>

212
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoever the killer was...</font>

213
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We mustn't be angry and we mustn't hate them!</font>

214
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>So, whoever the culprit is... {Copy-paste from 546}</i></font>

215
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>please don't be angry for me.</i></font>

216
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't lose yourself in anger and hatred because of me. {End copy-paste from 546... Also man what a bloody pointless flashback.}</i></font>

217
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi... You...</font>

218
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way... So you...</font>

219
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to stay true
to Mother's wishes from ten years ago...</font>

220
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you've been bearing the weight of the truth
alone inside Koukaku Tower all this time?!</font>

221
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She doesn't resent the person who killed her mother?!</font>

222
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it was her mother's dying wish, that's practically impossible!</font>

223
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a respectful brave daughter!</font>

224
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who else could do something like that?</font>

225
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't laugh, you scum!</i></font>

226
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could I <i>not</i> laugh at this?!</font>

227
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, Megalo?</font>

228
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you'd just attracted everyone's attention and raised the alarm when it happened,</font>

229
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you might have revealed that I was the assassin.</font>

230
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm amazed that you were able to stay silent.</font>

231
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then you chose this boneheaded brat
to reveal the truth to!</font>

232
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Had you told anyone else,
my plans would have been ruined before they began!</font>

233
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen close, Shirahoshi.
In the real world, we call that "Idiocy".</font>

234
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because you refused to hate me, this kingdom will fall.</font>

235
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of you...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">your father, your brothers,
you, and your people will all die...</font>

238
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's wrong!  Don't listen to him, Your Highness!</font>

239
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you did was not a mistake!</font>

240
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What else could it be?!</font>

241
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Highness!</font>

242

243

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!  Please stop this!</font>

244
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Father!  Brothers!</i></font>

245
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How pathetic!</font>

246
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hand me a sword.</font>

247
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe and Shirahoshi, the two people
I was worried about, have been captured.</font>

248
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no reason to keep to the schedule anymore.</font>

249
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will now commence the execution...</font>

250
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">of these foolish Royals!</font>

251
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do it!  Kill them!</font>

252
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execute them!</font>

253

255
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is hell on Earth!</font>

256
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our enemies are a hundred thousand outlaws...</font>

263
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  When?!</font>

264
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

265
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My predictions only show what will happen...</font>

266
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It could be tomorrow, or a year from now.</font>

267
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think he should do it now.</font>

268
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he started wreaking havoc right now, we'd be in trouble...</font>

269
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the bad guys would also be in trouble, right?!</font>

270
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want him to come now too!  I don't want the King to die!</font>

271
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me too!</font>

272
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The children are right.</font>

273
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it'd be for the best, too.</font>

274
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes... Yes...</font>

275
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey!  Straw Hat Luffy!</i></font>

276
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to destroy the island, then come do it now!</font>

277
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wreak havoc here, right now!</font>

278
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!  Can you hear us, Straw Hat?!</font>

279
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're still on the island, then come now!</font>

280
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat!</font>

281
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw Hat!  Straw Hat!  Straw Hat!</i></font>

282
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable.</font>

283
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're literally clutching at straws!</font>

284
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shyarly's predictions have always been accurate
but, just this once, it seems to have been a big lie.</font>

285
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such futile shouts.</font>

286
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to drag those delusional fools back to reality.</font>

287
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hear me, citizens!</font>

288
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, the former King Neptune's...</font>

289
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">execution will commence!</font>

290
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father...</font>

291
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch closely...</font>

292
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as the former King Neptune's head flies!</font>

293
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How regrettable...</font>

294
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die!</font>

295
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Please, protect my father!</i></font>

296
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Luffy-sama!</i></font>

297
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>T-That's...</i></font>

298
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Straw Hat... Luffy!</i></font>

299
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>He really... did show up!</i></font>

300
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, did you see that?</font>

301
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He saved King Neptune!</font>

302
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... And I'm sure
I just heard Princess Shirahoshi asking him for help...</font>

303
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama!</font>

304
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He came out of the shark?!</font>

305
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's been hiding in its belly the whole time?!</font>

306
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

307
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You came out early?</font>

308
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I guess you had no choice.</font>

309
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry, all of you!</font>

310
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Who is he talking to -hi?!</font>

311
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.  We were already hurrying.</font>

312
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would take some sort of impossible miracle...</font>

313
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">for Luffy to wait quietly according to plan.</font>

314
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mirage canceled!</font>

315
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A woman appeared out of nowhere -hi!</font>

316
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this it, Jinbe-chan?</font>

317
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The form from the Celestial Dragons?</font>

318
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excellent, you got it!</font>

319
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  Huh?!</font>

320
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The form's gone!  When did she...</font>

321
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fool!  What were you doing?!</font>

322
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Robin's got the keys to their chains.</font>

323
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way...</font>

324
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The keys are gone!</font>

325
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What were <i>you</i> doing?!</font>

326
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The chains!</font>

327
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

328
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Robin-sama...</font>

329
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

330
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father!  Are you alright?!</font>

331
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look up at the sky!  What is that?</font>

332
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

333
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A whale... and a lion?</font>

334
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, that's not it!</font>

335
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

336
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Lion's Roar Cannon</i></font>

337
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pirate ship!</font>

338
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire!</font>

339
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now!  Go, whale!</font>

340
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hoe?!</font>

341
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princes!  Hurry and get out of here, and take the King with you!</font>

342
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not gonna happen!  Stop -zugan!</font>

343
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They took the Royals!</font>

344
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!  Return the Royal Family -gyaban!</font>

345
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... happened?</font>

346
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like Jinbe made a plan with Straw Hat and his crew.</font>

347
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  There are so many people!</font>

348
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, now!  Are all of these guys enemies?</font>

349
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably.  From looking at them,
I'd say there are about seventy or eighty thousand...</font>

350
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, closer to a hundred thousand.</font>

351
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a little harsh.</font>

352
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case,
feel free to go nap in your room.</font>

353
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take them all out!</font>

354
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hell was that?!</font>

355
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see that you're itching for a fight.</font>

356
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's put on a flashy show, men!</font>

357
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  The Straw Hats are
getting off the ship, one after another!</font>

358
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

359
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really plan to destroy the island?!</font>

360
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you occupy Ryuuguu Palace?!</font>

361
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you planning to kill the Royal Family too?!</font>

362
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you kidnap those mermaids?!</font>

363
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, answer us!</font>

364
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you Fishman Island's enemies?  Or are you allies?</font>

365
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer us, Straw Hat!</font>

366
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Friend or foe...</font>

367
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can...</font>

368
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">decide that for yourselves!</font>
