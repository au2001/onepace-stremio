<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Scattered Evasion!</font>

2
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now fall and prepare to have your brain splattered!</font>

3
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mid-Air Spinning Big-Top!</font>

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did ya' like that, ya' big sea gorilla!</font>

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha-?! It didn't work?!</font>

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's dangerous!</font>

7
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Stop punching me!</font>

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Seems like you're a little stronger now...</font>

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, these guys're tough!</font>

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're these animals?</font>

11
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the Wrestlers of the Sea, the Blue Gorillas!</font>

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or just Blugori.</font>

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down! There's still four more of 'em...</font>

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have already beaten them up!</font>

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we don't have time to fight all these guys...</font>

16
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's amazing! He beat the Blugori!</font>

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what <i>are</i> you?!</font>

18
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, open the lock for us!</font>

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't there just one prisoner on the loose?</font>

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty sure it was just one...</font>

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe I'm seeing things, but I could've sworn I saw two shadows...</font>

23
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, five Blugori are down in front of Shared Cell 10.</font>

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five? There's no way!</font>

25
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There aren't any Level One prisoners who can beat the Blugori!</font>

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!?!?!?!</font>

27
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna save Ace?!</font>

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yup.</font>

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quiet!</font>

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You're</i> the one who were shouting...</font>

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, C'mon! Get the key to the cage...</font>

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough out of you!</font>

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know Ace?</font>

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure.</font>

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unlike you, that brother of yours was a gentleman.</font>

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that, we had a blast, and wound up drinking buddies...</font>

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a shame what's happened to him.</font>

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The nerve to lay a hand on Whitebeard's crew... The Navy sure is stupid.</font>

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go to that Level Five place.</font>

41
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's where Ace is, right?</font>

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think I care?! If you wanna go, then go by yourself.</font>

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Think we're friends or something?!</font>

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way I'm going somewhere that dangerous.</font>

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya.</font>

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you ain't leaving, I'll just escape on my own.</font>

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even with over a dozen warships out there?</font>

48
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really think you can get out?</font>

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A d-dozen?</font>

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it.</font>

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're preparing for Whitebeard's attacks...</font>

52
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps this is a bad time to leave.</font>

53
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guess I could kill some time down here, then.</font>

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh well. I'll just ask someone else.</font>

55
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please give us the key!</font>

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, there's no way!</font>

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It just can't be!</font>

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...?!</font>

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya. Good luck escaping.</font>

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no mistaking it.</font>

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, Straw Hat!</font>

62
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?!</font>

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There they are! Up there!</font>

64
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They found us!</font>

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd you have to shout?!</font>

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bracelet of yours sure is nice!</font>

67
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give it to me!</font>

68
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you talking about?</font>

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got this from Nami!</font>

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell ya how to get to where Ace is!</font>

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?</font>

72
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure. Will you give me that bracelet?</font>

73
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, if you'll help. Okay.</font>

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right!</font>

75
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then first, let's lose these guys!</font>

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry my feet with you!</font>

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feet?</font>

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run, Straw Hat!</font>

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Explanation of Buggy The Clown's Bara Bara Fruit Power.</font>

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's able to split up his body and control each part separately.</font>

81
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, his control is limited to a small field,</font>

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and his feet must remain on the ground while he's using his power.</font>

83
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a stroke of luck this is!</font>

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain! Captain!</font>

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

86
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure this is the spot?</font>

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary cave Captain John dug out in order to hide his great treasure,</font>

88
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that he cruelly protected in the past?</font>

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, this is the place. Keep moving.</font>

90
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right.</font>

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up!</font>

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The treasures are guarded,</font>

93
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so if you let your guard down, you might not live that long!</font>

94
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will we encounter monsters that would attack us,</font>

95
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or traps that you would see in Hell?</font>

96
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's do our best digging today, too!</font>

97
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Chief!</font>

98
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Are you the new guys?</font>

99
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, working up a sweat sure is great!</font>

100
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed! And our sweat will eventually create a tunnel and become the people's smiles!</font>

101
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, yeah! After hard work, sake tastes a little better too!</font>

102
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you making me do here?!</font>

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afterward, we went to and from on the Grand Line, searching for the treasure,</font>

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we never found a single bit.</font>

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was arrested here after I messed up flashily and broke into a Navy base...</font>

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I was thrown into this prison.</font>

107
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it seems my luck hasn't run out just yet!</font>

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep running as fast as you can, Straw Hat!</font>

109
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take you to Level Two!</font>

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level Two? That's not it!</font>

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go to Level Five!</font>

112
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I'm taking you there!
You can't just go straight to Level Five!</font>

113
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen up. The first undersea floor of Impel Down, where we are, is Level One.</font>

114
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As you descend into Level Two, Level Three, and below,</font>

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the prisoners will become more and more vicious.</font>

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was sent all the way to Level Four and exposed to the Inferno,</font>

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I don't know anything about the floors beneath that.</font>

118
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I remember it right, Level Five is where the nastiest criminals with bounties above 100 million are kept.</font>

119
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But some of the prisoners say there's another level below that one, too!</font>

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say it holds the villains so evil that they had to be erased from history itself!</font>

121
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a rumor, but Ace might be down there.</font>

122
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I can't take you any deeper than Level Four.</font>

123
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? You're a nice guy now?</font>

124
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course! I mean, you're giving me the Treasure Mark that'll lead me to Captain John's treasure!</font>

125
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...I told him!</font>

126
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in here 'cause you're weak, right?</font>

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be nosy! Leave me alone!</font>

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He didn't notice!</font>

129
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good thing this guy's slow.</font>

130
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. So this bracelet is some sort of treasure-map-thingy, huh?</font>

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had no idea!</font>

132
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were paying attention then, dammit!</font>

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, now I have no choice!</font>

134
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll just let you have it right now.</font>

135
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're... giving it to me knowing how valuable it is?</font>

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure. Saving Ace is more important to me anyway.</font>

137
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-But if you give it to me now, I might just fly off and leave you here!</font>

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You could, but you said you'd show me the way, didn't you?</font>

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't look at me with honest eyes like that!</font>

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just a cheap, worthless scumbag, ya know!</font>

141
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't just take my word!</font>

142
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The map to the treasure of my dreams...</font>

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain John's Treasure Mark.</font>

144
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I accept your offering!</font>

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I owe you one, Straw Hat!</font>

146
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, how do I get away from this guy?</font>

147
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm? So we'll get there faster if we break that wall?</font>

148
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right! I'll handle it!</font>

149
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not...!</font>

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are these guys?!</font>

151
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Buggy the Clown, who escaped from his cell, and...</font>

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's that?! There are two of them!</font>

153
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the surveillance room!</font>

154
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means, breaking out of here would be a really bad idea!</font>

155
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Straw Ha-ugh...</font>

156
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is this place?!</font>

157
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A forest inside the prison?</font>

158
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A red forest?</font>

159
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's lots of people down there, too!</font>

160
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those're the prisoners!</font>

161
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ain't no ordinary forest!</font>

162
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The blades on the trees are razor sharp.</font>

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the Sabertrees!</font>

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the grass sticking up from the floor...</font>

165
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is the Needlegrass, which pierces your body like spikes!</font>

166
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chased by poisonous spiders and jailers,</font>

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the prisoners run around getting cut by the leaves and the grass,</font>

168
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">staining them with their blood!</font>

169
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their punishment is being sliced up and covered in blood...</font>

170
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is Level One, Crimson Hell!</font>

171
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what Impel Down is like!</font>

172
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,920
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down, the Underwater Prison  -  Level 1
Crimson Hell</font>

173
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

174
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hurts!</font>

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This really IS Hell!</font>

176
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Ace have to go through this too?</font>

177
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I Got it! We can just keep falling like this!</font>

178
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?! We'll get cut up!</font>

179
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't get cut!</font>

180
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just shut up and hold on!</font>

181
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat! My feet!</font>

182
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw my feet down there!</font>

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feet?</font>

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

185
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What is that?</font>

186
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

187
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as I've got my feet on the ground, we'll be fine!</font>

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't need a staircase from this floor to the next!</font>

189
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't need an access key, either!</font>

190
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just remembered, there's an escape route readied for anyone who wants to escape from the pain!</font>

191
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's an escape route in Hell?</font>

192
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look! This is it!</font>

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A hole?</font>

194
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's pitch-black!</font>

195
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an escape route, but there's nobody who tries to escape through here.</font>

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna know why, Straw Hat?</font>

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because this escape route leads to Level Two!</font>

198
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's connected to an even more terrifying Hell than this one!</font>

199
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There might be some who try to run from Hell and back up to the surface,</font>

200
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's nobody who'd be dumb enough to jump from the surface and into Hell!</font>

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it! This makes things a lot easier!</font>

202
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've just gotta jump in, right?</font>

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, but once we reach the bottom, we'll be in...</font>

204
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HEY! HEY!</font>

205
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This hole sure is deep! What's down there?</font>

206
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has no self-control at all.</font>

207
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ain't he afraid of anything?</font>

208
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah well...</font>

209
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I run now, he won't follow me, after all!</font>

210
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got away from 'im!</font>

211
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally got the marker for the treasure of my dreams!</font>

212
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who'd want to lead the way in here?</font>

213
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya, Straw Hat!</font>

214
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just go to Level Three or Level Four or whatever by yourself, and die!</font>

215
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You dumbass Blugori!</font>

216
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a scatter man. I won't get sliced up even if you cut me!</font>

217
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My feet...?</font>

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding!</font>

219
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the surveillance room!</font>

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There really was another one!</font>

221
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two of them are falling toward Level Two!</font>

222
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please confirm!</font>

223
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood!</font>

224
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,770
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down, the Underwater Prison  -  Level 2
Demonic Beast Floor</font>

225
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What? The monsters are agitated for some reason.</font>

226
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Think they're hungry?</font>

227
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have the energy to be scared anymore...</font>

228
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sooner or later, we all become their fodder...</font>

229
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">HUGE! IT'S AN ACCURSED BEAST!!</font>

230
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This man, he's...</font>

231
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! The rumors were true after all!</font>

232
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna die!</font>

233
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never even wanted to come to Level Two!</font>

234
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was plannin' to leave you behind and make a break for it!</font>

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you say something, Buggy?</font>

236
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what the hell is that?!</font>

237
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it's the rarest of mutants!</font>

238
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A snake hatched from a chicken's egg: a Basilisk!</font>

239
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,960
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><font size="31">Guard

240
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those things come from chickens?!</font>

241
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">YOU KIDDIN' ME? THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A MONSTER!</font>

242
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up on the surface, it'd just attack and eat people, so they had it brought down here as a guard.</font>

243
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!</font>

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time for this!</font>

245
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, just bring it on!</font>

246
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is quite hot.</font>

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, like the Assistant Warden told you earlier,</font>

248
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Warden resides in Level Four, the Inferno.</font>

249
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's an enormous fire surrounding this room.</font>

250
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've arrived.</font>

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the Warden?</font>

252
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden Magellan has diarrhea and spends about ten hours a day in the bathroom calming his stomach.</font>

253
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He spends another eight hours sleeping,</font>

254
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and taking his lunch and breaks into account,</font>

255
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he works about four hours a day.</font>

256
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he still manages to keep his position as Warden?</font>

257
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's quite reliable when it counts.</font>

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to have kept you waiting. Here he comes.</font>

259
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I forgot to mention, the Warden ate the Doku Doku Fruit.</font>

260
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Doku = Poison</i></font>

261
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a poison man.</font>

262
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A poison man?</font>

263
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please be careful.</font>

264
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for your hard work!</font>

265
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back from your noble task, Warden!!</font>

266
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always, that was one hell of a battle.</font>

267
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be visitors.</font>

268
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the Warden, Magellan.</font>

269
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,610
<font face="Roboto" size="39">Impel Down Warden, Magellan</font>

270
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,610
<font face="Roboto" size="39">(Poison human who ate the Doku Doku Fruit)</font>

271
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, so bright! Such a bright room!</font>

272
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to be in a darker, more confined room!</font>

273
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I could, I'd keep my heart confined too!</font>

274
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden, Vice Admiral Momonga and the Warlord Boa Hancock-dono are here to see you.</font>

276
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in a hurry, Warden Magellan.</font>

277
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I apologize.</font>

278
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bit of a problem with runny stool.</font>

279
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose the poison-soup I had for lunch did not agree with me.</font>

280
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whaddya expect? It was poison!</font>

281
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a poison-man, so poisons are my favorite!</font>

282
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, don't they say "poison quells poison"?</font>

283
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quelling it so well you've got diarrhea, then?</font>

284
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, you're as poison-tongued as ever, Hannyabal.</font>

285
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Retire already, so I can take your post, plea-</font>

286
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, whoops! I meant hurry and take them to Fire Fist Ace, please!</font>

287
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too cruel! Your mistake was just too cruel!</font>

288
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have such a heartless subordinate!</font>

289
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take these.</font>

290
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! B-Be careful when you exhale!</font>

291
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your breath is poisonous, ya know...</font>

292
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you laughing?!</font>

293
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Serves you right, foolish subordinate.</font>

294
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your breath and your attitude are both poisonous!</font>

295
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, exactly, were you attempting to have me inhale?!</font>

296
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such insolence!</font>

297
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow! Such a beauty! I'm in love!</font>

298
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so jealous...</font>

299
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Assistant Warden.</font>

300
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Warden's seat.</font>

301
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be mine eventually.</font>

302
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in a hurry!</font>

303
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, this is the Warden speaking.</font>

304
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are YOU answering?!</font>

305
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woe is me! I'm dying! God dammit!</font>

306
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always wanted to be Warden...!</font>

307
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare the antidote for the Assistant Warden.</font>

308
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

309
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

310
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Intruders in MY Impel Down?!</font>

311
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible!</font>

312
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone broke into Impel Down, which has never been breached since its founding?!</font>

313
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a horrible crisis!</font>

314
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Warden's responsibility!</font>

315
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could he have been spotted?!</font>

316
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Transfer all live camera feeds to me now!</font>

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warden...</font>

318
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like to go see the prisoner as soon as possible.</font>

319
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, let's go! Going right now!</font>

320
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Warden! This is a major incident, you know!</font>

321
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's odd...</font>

322
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lost contact with Warden Magellan.</font>

323
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In any case, hurry up and report this to all floors and Navy HQ!</font>

324
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know how he got here or what he wants,</font>

325
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the guy who's been running around Level Two with Buggy the Clown...</font>

326
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is without a doubt the pirate, Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

327
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't get in touch with the monitoring room on Level Two!</font>

328
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

329
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Level Two monitoring room! Did something happen?</font>

330
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Respond, monitoring room!</font>

331
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right!</font>

332
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His hand just became huge!</font>

333
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that you did just now?!</font>

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Gear Third...</font>

335
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems we beat it somehow...</font>

336
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, I'm back to normal!</font>

337
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's hurry to Level Three!</font>

338
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gods have come to free us from Hell!</font>

339
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing, they beat that monster!</font>

340
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They defeated the Basilisk!</font>

341
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did it!</font>

342
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys're awesome!</font>

343
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's more, you knocked it into the monitoring room!</font>

344
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable! You guys're GODS!</font>

345
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dunno who you are, but thanks!</font>

346
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mind getting the keys for us?</font>

347
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The keys for the cages and handcuffs!</font>

348
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've landed over there!</font>

349
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that...?</font>

350
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's keep going!</font>

351
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be impatient.</font>

352
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in a hurry!</font>

353
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

354
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he here?!</font>

355
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I suppose him being out of his cage means that he MUST be trying to buy back his freedom!</font>

356
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can take advantage of this, and use it as a chance to win back my freedom!</font>

357
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would appear the God of Good Fortune has not yet abandoned me!</font>

358
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Want this, you guys?!</font>

359
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">YEAH!</font>

360
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course we want it!</font>

361
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and give it to us!</font>

362
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the attitude you should have when asking someone a favor?</font>

363
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sorry!</font>

364
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'll give them to you!</font>

365
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be grateful to me, the great Captain Buggy-sama!</font>

366
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! It's open!</font>

367
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be grateful, you fools!</font>

368
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, say the name of the man who freed you!</font>

369
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Buggy!</font>

370
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll never forget what you did for us!</font>

371
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're our savior, Captain Buggy!</font>

372
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's it! Carve that name into your hearts!</font>

373
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now unlock all the cages!</font>

374
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was an accident that I fell down here,</font>

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but if I cause a riot, it'll be easier for me to escape!</font>

376
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you satisfied now?</font>

377
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Let go of me!</font>

378
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you've gotta help me out!</font>

379
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Hey, Straw Hat!</font>

380
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and show me the way!</font>

381
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there a hole to take us down like before?</font>

382
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know how to get to Level Three!</font>

383
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way I'd remember all the
passageways in this maze of a prison!</font>

384
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, Captain Buggy!</font>

385
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now we're free too!</font>

386
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out, Straw Hat!</font>

387
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?!</font>

388
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You told me you'd guide me to Level Four!</font>

389
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a lie! A lie!</font>

390
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just lied to get the treasure!</font>

391
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now all the prisoners are gonna mess this floor up good!</font>

392
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lied to me?!</font>

393
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's up with you guys?!</font>

394
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't this your big chance to escape?!</font>

395
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, looks like we got a little ahead of ourselves...</font>

396
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have a chance here.</font>

397
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not as long as the boss of this floor is here...</font>

398
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, we're better off inside the cells.</font>

399
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,770
