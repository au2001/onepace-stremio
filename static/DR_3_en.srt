than that old man's!</font>

132
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So cool!</font>

133
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to show this to Usopp and the others!</font>

134
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong?!</font>

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Th-The nobleman is so...</font>

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobleman?!</font>

137
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of the women are fainting.</font>

138
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

139
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, its too much!</font>

140
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, that's Cavendish!</font>

141
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate Noble?! He's alive?!</font>

142
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe how beautiful he is!</font>

143
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the dressing room, huh?</font>

144
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you, right there.</font>

145
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That won't do.</font>

146
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a weight limit for gear.</font>

147
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,410
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Gladiator
Lucy</font>

148
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, whatever you do,
you have no chance.</font>

149
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will win the Flame Fruit.</font>

150
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,870
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Captain of the Beautiful Pirates
"White Horse Cavendish"
 Bounty: 280,000,000 Belly</font>

151
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! With that beautiful power that belongs only to me.</font>

152
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're overweight.</font>

153
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

154
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you earlier! Come here!</font>

155
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tsk! But I look so cool in this!</font>

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That explains why everybody's half-naked.</font>

157
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gladiators are just part of a show for them.</font>

158
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People get excited seeing a loser's blood.</font>

159
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the Colosseum, people 
 show their true colors.</font>

160
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How is watching a match between two heavily-armored competitors any fun?</font>

161
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For them, this battle is just a show.</font>

162
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if I have to take off this cape too?</font>

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks so cool!</font>

164
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you.</font>

165
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I watched you take down that big guy earlier.</font>

166
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

167
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Luffy!</font>

168
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lu...</font>

170
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna become the Pirate King!</font>

171
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lu...</font>

172
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean Lucy!</font>

173
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, I'm Lucy.</font>

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't confuse us!</font>

175
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're Lucy!</font>

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought Straw Hat Luffy was here!</font>

177
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way!</font>

178
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard the real one is 
a eight-meter-tall giant!</font>

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is nice!</font>

180
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you were really...</font>

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy, I would have...</font>

182
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">killed you here and now.</font>

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

184
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came to the New World three years ago.</font>

185
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole world was talking about this beautiful rookie who was worth over 200 million.</font>

186
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was in the newspapers everyday.</font>

187
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Girls went nuts over my wanted posters.</font>

188
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They would steal all of the posters in town.</font>

189
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everybody was going crazy over me.</font>

190
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Hey, big star!"</font>

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Who? Me?"</font>

192
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Of course!"</font>

193
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

194
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...one year later,</font>

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whitebeard's War drew their attention away from me!</font>

196
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whole world's attention was on Straw Hat Luffy and Whitebeard!</font>

197
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On top of that,</font>

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">new rookies kept coming up one after another, became known as the Worst Generation,</font>

199
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and wreaked havoc like crazy!</font>

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Reporters won't pay attention to me anymore!</font>

201
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I'm gonna kill them!
 Every one of those annoying newcomers!</font>

202
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of them!</font>

203
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you're saying is absurd.</font>

204
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say whatever you like!</font>

205
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To recapture world attention again,</font>

206
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would kill as many newcomers as it takes!</font>

207
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To do so, I'm gonna win the Flame Fruit today!</font>

208
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your good to go.</font>

209
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're taking the same attitude as them!</font>

210
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you a competitor?</font>

211
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You look weak but you're a cutie!</font>

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm... Interesting.</font>

213
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ended up looking like this old man.</font>

214
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you interested in him?</font>

215
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

216
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca. I'm a gladiator.</font>

217
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,980
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Corrida Colosseum Gladiator
Rebecca</font>

218
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for what you did earlier.</font>

219
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't like Spartan.</font>

220
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This statue is cast after a legendary man.</font>

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was the strongest gladiator in the history of Corrida Colosseum, Kyros.</font>

222
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He won 3000 out of 3000 matches.</font>

223
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only wound he ever 
received was a single slash.</font>

224
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! He was that strong?!</font>

225
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used to fight here up until 20 years ago.</font>

226
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But no one in this country knows about him.</font>

227
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

228
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">None of elders or gladiators in this country
have ever seen him.</font>

229
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the most mysterious statue in Dressrosa.</font>

230
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know if Kyros the Gladiator actually existed...</font>

231
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or if somebody made up the story and put a statue here.</font>

232
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we know is
what's written on this plaque.</font>

233
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although nobody knows about him,</font>

234
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">nobody wants to remove it.</font>

235
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's also strange.</font>

236
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm... I don't get it at all but...</font>

237
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like this statue! It's so manly!</font>

238
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like it, too.</font>

239
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Great Warrior Rebecca-chan!</font>

240
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The undefeated girl!
We know you'll do it today, too!</font>

241
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure you were relieved earlier...</font>

242
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Spartan guy who bullied you for 
a long time got his ass kicked.</font>

243
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, idiot! Let's go!</font>

244
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with them?</font>

245
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ignore them.</font>

246
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

247
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna fight for the last time today.</font>

248
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna win the Flame Fruit and...</font>

249
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kill Doflamingo!</font>

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Mingo?!</font>

251
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What block are you in?</font>

252
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C.</font>

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good. I'm in D.</font>

254
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope we both survive the first round.</font>

255
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy.</font>

256
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The winner of Block A is the masked man!</font>

257
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mr. Store!</font>

258
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was so fast!</font>

259
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Is he going to take his mask off?! For real?!</font>

260
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took it off!</font>

261
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe this! We all know him!</font>

263
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an interesting start!
And an unexpected competitor!</font>

264
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The winner of the Block A battle royale is...</font>

265
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,620

319
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need, maybe, three warships.</font>

320

327
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll need as many medics as we can get.</font>

there are in the Colosseum...</font>

330
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the population of this town.</font>

331
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay... Instead of the enemy numbers?</font>

332
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it necessary?</font>

333
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What we have to consider first is
not the number of enemies...</font>

334
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...but the number of people we have to protect, don't you think?</font>

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir!</font>

351
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wouldn't be wise to go there.</font>

352
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you people some kind of researchers or explorers?</font>

353
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better not go unless you have a purpose that's worth risking your life for.</font>

354
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bridge looks very strong...</font>

355
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it's made of iron.</font>

356
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But look at the entrance.
Nobody is crossing it nowadays.</font>

360
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mister, what's a Fighting Fish?</font>

361
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a savage fish with horns.</font>

362
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you approach them by ship, they'll capsize you.</font>

363
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why they reinforced the bridge with iron, but it doesn't help.</font>

364
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use?! What do you mean?!</font>

365
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you saying they can take down an iron bridge?!</font>

366
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I don't know the current condition of the bridge.</font>

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only people who crossed it know, but I don't know anyone who's came back.</font>

368

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just an old man out for a walk!</font>

402
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lie! Isn't that a topknot under your hat?</font>

403
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the samurai, Foxfire Kin'emon, aren't you?!</font>

404
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We saw you in the video from Punk Hazard.</font>

408
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now now, just come along quietly!</font>

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How reliable!</font>

419

425
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen! The taster's role is to try just a little of the shogun's food to check for poison!</font>

426
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood?!</font>

427
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir!</font>

446
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">maybe he has had some kind of trauma at a young age.</font>

448
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. It was something like that.</font>

449
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Bone-kichi!</font>

450
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes?</font>

451
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do something to warm the place up.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No. Luffy-san is the only one I take orders fro-</font>

453
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,470

460
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, everybody!</font>

461
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

462
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like it...</font>

463
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

464
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was just the four of us on the ship.</font>

465
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So did I... I wonder what's making that noise.</font>

466
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Creepy!</font>

467
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared!</font>

468
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Nami!</font>

469
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like it... Honestly...</font>

470
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I-It's from the men's dormitory.</font>

471
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I don't like it!</font>

472
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is somebody in there!</font>

473
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?</font>

476
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Bartolomeo?!</font>

477
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're Bartolomeo, aren't you?</font>

478
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Block B's match will start soon!</font>

479
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And did you see a competitor named Capman?</font>

480
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,480
