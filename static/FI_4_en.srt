<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait, Luffy, when you say Jinbe...
You didn't befriend another Warlord, did you?!</font>

65
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, wait, he quit during the war,
so I guess he's an ex-Warlord now.</font>

00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really wanna meet Jinbe!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let us meet again in two years, at Fishman Island! </i></font>

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promised I'd meet him on this island!</font>

75
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that you mention it,
I read an article that said you were with Boss Jinbe.</font>

76
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is Jinbe?</font>

77
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Well, he isn't on the island.</font>

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know how he resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea during the war two years ago?</font>

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of that, the former members of the
Fishman Pirates couldn't stay on this island anymore.</font>

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they all left, together with Boss Jinbe.</font>

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  So does that mean I can't see him?</font>

83
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a long story, but basically the war had a great impact on this island too.</font>

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie!</font>

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship is coming!</font>

86
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might be coming!</font>

87
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A royal ship is coming!</font>

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe nobody's on it!</font>

89
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course there's somebody on it!</font>

90
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's onboard the ship, Killifish-chins?</font>

91
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know yet.</font>

92
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The royal ship, such a rare sight!</font>

93
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship that hardly ever comes here!</font>

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe they're here to arrest Luffy-chin and the others, since they're illegal immigrants?</font>

95
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if they are?</font>

96
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You all have to hide, Luffy-chin!</font>

97
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the royal family's gondola?</font>

98
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it really?</font>

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is!</font>

100
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it?</font>

101
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is, isn't it?</font>

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what if it is?</font>

103
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it can't actually be
someone from the royal family, can it?</font>

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They wouldn't come all the way
out to this corner of the island themselves.</font>

105
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three Neptune Brothers have arrived!</font>

125
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,890

126
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are they really so important?</font>

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, for you princes to come all the way out here...</font>

128
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,650

they are who I think they are.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, those are the princes from the Neptune Army!</font>

133
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they doing here?</font>

134
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a problem.</font>

135
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  Thank you for your assistance.</font>

136
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will look elsewhere.</font>

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive us for disturbing you while you were having such a good time.</font>

138
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's have another dance sometime!</font>

139
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry for disturbing you-fa-mi-re-do!</font>

140
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not at all!</font>

141
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did the border police make a mistake?</font>

142
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i></font>

143
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-chan!</font>

144
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All that blood... Sanji's in trouble!</font>

145
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't work!
All the excitement he was holding in erupted!</font>

146
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

147
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No doubt about it.  That's the pirate Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

148
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ammo Knights!</font>

149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yes, Sir!</i></font>

150
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaddayaknow, Straw Hat and his group are here.</font>

151
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are we gonna do?
The army will get them before us!</font>

152
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's a bad idea to fight the Neptune Army here.</font>

153
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, wait!</font>

154
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sorry about entering the country illegally!</font>

155
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you're gonna arrest us, please do it later!</font>

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there anyone here willing to donate their blood?!</font>

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without help, our companion will be dead within an hour!</font>

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has blood type S, RH-.</font>

159
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not very common,
but is there anyone here with that type?!</font>

160
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or do mermen and fishmen have different blood from humans?</font>

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper-chin...</font>

162
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!  Isn't there anyone?!</font>

163
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't... You can't die such a ridiculous death!</font>

164
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, anyone!  I'm begging you!</font>

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give Sanji blood!</font>

166
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin, Chopper-chin!</font>

167
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both mermen and fishmen have
the same blood types as humans.</font>

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's possible to do a blood transfusion.</font>

169
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

170
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These humans are spouting nonsense!</font>

171
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the guys with the sea monsters!</font>

172
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prince Fukaboshi,
it's Hammond of the Fishman District.</font>

173
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give our blood to an inferior species like you humans?</font>

174
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody on Fishman Island would be so obliging!</font>

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And even if you found someone...</font>

176
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the human-haters on this island would
subject them to the Judgment of the Dark Night!</font>

177
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That kid can just lie there and bleed to death.
He's completely beyond help!</font>

178
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is an old law in this country...</font>

179
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"You shall not share your blood with humans."</font>

180
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

181
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make no mistake!
This law was created by you humans.</font>

182
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">During our long history together,
you humans have always feared us as monsters!</font>

183
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were the ones
who forbade the mixing of our blood!</font>

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is what caused the death of
Fishman Island's hero, Fisher Tiger.</font>

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who put his life on the line to
free all slaves, regardless of their species.</font>

186
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He died after a bloody battle, even though he could have easily been saved by a blood transfusion!</font>

187
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The heartless humans refused to give him blood...</font>

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>so he died!</i></font>

189
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Disregard the life of that one underling of yours, and come with us to the Fishman District!</font>

190
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The captain of the New Fishman Pirates, Hody Jones-sama, wants to see you!</font>

191
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I don't know anything about your rules, but please,</font>

192
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">isn't there anyone here with the blood type S, RH-?!</font>

193
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't care what we have to do in return!</font>

194
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For now, please just save his life!</font>

195
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

196
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're not gonna come willingly...</font>

197
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll just have to bring you along by force!</font>

198
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trawl Net!</font>

199
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I already told you...</font>

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't...</font>

201
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">do what you say!</font>

202
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jet Pistol!</font>

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!  There's a sea monster behind you!</font>

204
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hammond and his gang from the Fishman District...</font>

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sea monster...</font>

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">admitted defeat without even fighting?!</font>

207
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?  Luffy-chan is amazing!</font>

209
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would expect no less.</font>

210
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

211
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring Sanji-chin aboard!</font>

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go to the city!</font>

213
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of humans at the port in the city!</font>

214
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

215
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You there, wait!
The Ryuuguu belongs to the princes!</font>

216
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!  I promise to give it back after we've saved Sanji-chin!</font>

217
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, we're aboard! Caimie, let's go!</font>

218
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please Ryuuguu-chin! Take us to the city!</font>

219
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry.</font>

220
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If only I had the same blood type, I would gladly help.</font>

221
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have nothing to apologize for.</font>

222
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's his fault for having
perverted thoughts in the first place.</font>

223
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just look!  He's still grinning.</font>

224
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!  Just stop it, already!</font>

225
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't imagine anything at all!
We don't have a second to spare!</font>

226
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, this reminds me of the discrimination that
you and Hachi suffered on Sabaody two years ago.</font>

227
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like the problem runs deep.</font>

228
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought a nosebleed could become something serious like this.</font>

229
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah... Even if we get to the city,
I'm still a bit worried.</font>

230
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will we find someone willing to donate blood on time?</font>

231
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the past month,
no humans have come to the island at all.</font>

232
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the first guests we've had in a while.</font>

233
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?  Isn't this a famous tourist spot?</font>

234
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, it is, but...</font>

235
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know for sure, but there's a rumor that something is interfering with travelers' voyages.</font>

236
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That there's some shadowy force behind all of this... People all over the country are talking about it.</font>

237
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is quite inconvenient, you know.</font>

238
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why were you hiding the pirates from us?</font>

239
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're so sorry, Prince Fukaboshi!</font>

240
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie said they were her friends.</font>

241
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They weren't bad people, so we didn't want them to be arrested as illegal immigrants.</font>

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will Sanji-chan really be alright?</font>

243
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're jumping to conclusions.  They are famous pirates.</font>

244
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter how they entered the country.</font>

245
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were already perfectly aware who they are.</font>

246
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were looking for them
for a different reason-re-mi-fa!</font>

247
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

248
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't get a chance to give them...</font>

249
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe's message.</font>

250
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,930
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Ryuuguu Kingdom, Port Town 
 "Coral Hill"</font>

251
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!  Are you awake?</font>

252
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-chin!</font>

253
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?</font>

254
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness!</font>

255
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're in the house of one of my friends from the port town.</font>

256
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-chin, you'd lost
most of the blood in your body!</font>

257
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad we were able to find
a donor with the same blood type!</font>

258
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see... My blood, huh?</font>

259
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to me?</font>

260
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't get up so suddenly!  Stay in bed.</font>

261
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But really, why did the fishmen refuse to give him blood?</font>

262
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We ran all over town,
but we couldn't find any humans!</font>

263
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I honestly thought it was hopeless!</font>

264
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks for helping me, you guys.</font>

265
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... I can't remember a thing.</font>

266
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where was I, and what was I doing?</font>

267
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't recall it!  </i></font>

268
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get another nosebleed, you'll be beyond saving!</font>

269
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right!  Sanji, let me introduce
the blood donors we met at the bar!</font>

270
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean I was given blood by... a delicate lady?</font>

271
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quite alright...</font>

272
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We humans need to help each other out in times of need.</font>

273
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright, silly.</font>

274
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,850
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Pirate Twins 
 Splash and Splatter</font>

275
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you like, we'll gladly give you more, silly.</font>

276
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad you've recovered.</font>

277
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, thank them already.</font>

278
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy.  Let me see your right arm for a second.</font>

279
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A poison reaction...</font>

280
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That wound is poisoned.</font>

281
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, while I was fighting the fishmen earlier...</font>

282
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did feel a slight sting.</font>

283
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you're completely fine?!</font>

284
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This poison is lethal!</font>

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's amazing!</font>

286
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's body must have developed antitoxins, and repelled the poison without us noticing!</font>

287
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you been exposed to
large amounts of poison before?</font>

288
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison, huh...</font>

289
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was almost killed by poison back in Impel Down.</font>

290
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Almost killed?
Is that really something to laugh about?!</font>

291
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must have been that guy...</font>

292
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The swordsman with the octopus-legs.</font>

293
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He withstood my attack, after all.</font>

294
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was pretty tough.</font>

295
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That came from the cove.</font>

296
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those mermaids sure are noisy.</font>

297
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, what should I do?</font>

298
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys are both out cold.</font>

299
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And I carelessly ended up poisoning Straw Hat.</font>

300
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,870
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Assassin of the New Fishman Pirates
Hyouzou <font size="30">(Blue-Ringed Octopus Merman)</font></font>

301
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd be real bad if he died.</font>

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That scream was from Ishilly and the others, right?</font>

303
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ishilly!</font>

304
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Ishilly!</i></font>

305
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure I heard them over here.</font>

306
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where could they have gone?</font>

307
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Earlier, I heard them talking about opening a barrel.</font>

308
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The manager of the Mermaid Café.  She let us borrow the room.</font>

309
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

310
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is Madame Shyarly.</font>

311
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  Thanks!</font>

312
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the blond boy alright now?</font>

313
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,860
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Owner of the Mermaid Cafe
Madame Shyarly</font>

314
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

315
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Madame, since you're so beautiful,</font>

316
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you should stay out of his room for now.</font>

317
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, the fact that we're in the back rooms
of the Mermaid Café...</font>

318
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep it a secret from Sanji-chin.</font>

319
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

320
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because if he finds out...</font>

321
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he'll be in trouble again,
or so his doctor, Chopper-chin, says.</font>

322
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's an odd prescription.</font>

323
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Huge mermaid!</font>

324
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her name is Madame Shyarly, Luffy-chin!</font>

325
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?</font>

326
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's so pretty!</font>

327
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't touch that, Straw Hat Boy.</font>

328
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

329
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a crystal ball.  It's used for fortune-telling.</font>

330
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame is famous for
making predictions here on Coral Hill.</font>

331
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've quit fortune-telling.</font>

332
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's better not to know the future.</font>

333
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, do mermaids poop?</font>

334
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaddaya mean, "so"?!
That has nothing to do with fortune-telling!</font>

335
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You vulgar boy!</font>

336
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apologize to her, Luffy-chin!</font>

337
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry!</font>

338
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie...</font>

339
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Feel free to take the day off.</font>

340
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give your friends a tour of the island.</font>

341
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure?</font>

342
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been working really hard, after all.</font>

343
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides...</font>

344
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lately, we haven't gotten a single human pirate customer.</font>

345
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will be good for business.</font>

346
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The girls from the cove will be coming here soon, so we've got more than enough staff.</font>

347
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that reminds me!</font>

348
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I have to hurry and give Pappagg his clams!</i></font>

349
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one weird way to realize that.</font>

350
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be starving.</font>

351
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

352
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you mean Monsieur Pappagg, he met an old friend of his.</font>

353
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The two of them are hanging out in the café right now.</font>

354
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't mention this earlier but...</font>

355
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when the Madame was still a child,</font>

356
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">she said that lots of pirates
would be coming to the island soon...</font>

357
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then the Great Age of Pirates began the following year.</font>

358
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!</i></font>

359
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'd take way too long if I told you all the details,</font>

360
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but a while back she also predicted
the war at Marineford and the death of Whitebeard.</font>

361
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since she's predicted so many bad things, it sounds like she's gotten tired of it.</font>

362
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's scary!</font>

363
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, where's Chopper?</font>

364
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's looking after Sanji.</font>

365
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin, Usopp-chin!</font>

366
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Coming!</font>

367
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the main street on Coral Hill.</font>

368
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  This is the entrance to the Mermaid Café!</font>

369
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, I sure am hungry!</font>

370
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a café!</font>

371
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have food here too.</font>

372
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like cake and fruits of the sea!</font>

373
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about meat?</font>

374
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Merfolk don't eat meat or fish, so...</font>

375
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the menu consists of Seaweed Brûlée, Algae Tart, Kelp Soufflé...</font>

376
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is any of that good?</font>

377
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we do have meat too!</font>

378
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

379
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shellfish meat, Scallop Sandwich, Freshwater Clam Pizza-</font>

380
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shellfish meat doesn't count!  Don't insult meat like that!</font>

381
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's get going.  To the Mermaid Café.</font>

382
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  Pappagg's waiting for us.</font>

383
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean it!  Don't look down on meat!</font>

384
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thank you very much!</i></font>

385
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>

386
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook-chin!</font>

387
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh?  Why, if it isn't Luffy-san!</font>

388
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Caimie-san, it has been far too long!</font>

389
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw!  Nose!</font>

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've really missed you guys!</font>

391
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're finally here?</font>

392
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were with Pappagg?</font>

393
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please come again, Soul King!</font>

394
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels like we've been living a dream!</font>

395
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm definitely comin' back, beautiful mermaids!</font>

396
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need to loosen my bones a little.</font>

398
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah!  But if I were to loosen my bones, I'd die!</font>

399
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't mind dying right now!  Though I already am dead.</font>

400
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Amazing!</font>

401
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've just been in a café,
yet the tension is already this high?</font>

402
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!  What's it like in there?</font>

403
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, wait just a minute!</font>

404
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like you're leaving today, is it?</font>

405
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:12,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand why you're interested,
but later you can all go to the Mermaid Café together.</font>

406
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was just about to take Bones on a tour of my mansion!</font>

407
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me!  Do you like the meat of sea beasts?</font>

408
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have meat?!</font>

409
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think a wild man such as myself
would be satisfied with seashells and seaweed?</font>

410
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My diet consists of
the meat of the very fiercest sea beasts!</font>

411
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Pappagg, I forgot!</font>

412
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here are your clams for today.</font>

413
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay!  Caimie's delicious clams!</font>

414
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, aren't those just shellfish?!</font>

415
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Merfolk don't eat meat and fish, but fishmen do.</font>

416
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's not like there isn't any of it on this island.</font>

417
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  That's a relief!</font>

418
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, taxi!</font>

419
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken?!</font>

420
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is a ghost on the wanted list?</font>

421
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guy from the ghost ship we met on the way here?</font>

422
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  You met him?!</font>

423
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's some kind of undersea robber who
the country has been hunting down for ages.</font>

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But let's talk about that later.  For now, get onboard!</font>

425
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken used to send a love letter to the Mermaid Princess of Ryuuguu Kingdom every week.</font>

426
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eventually he went from letters to packages,
 and then threats and demands for her to marry him.</font>

427
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is so fluffy!  It feels so nice!</font>

428
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This truly feels like paradise!</font>

429
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen to what I'm saying!</i></font>

430
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sure!</i></font>

431
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, excuse me.</font>

432
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The princess was terrified...</font>

433
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the country could no longer ignore it, so...</font>

434
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!  The princess' father, King Neptune, got upset,</font>

435
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the three princes you met earlier mobilized the army to chase after him,</font>

436
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they couldn't find him.</font>

437
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie... Caimie... I was just about to explain that.</font>

438
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So basically, King Neptune the Sea God,
who rules this country,</font>

439
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has four children including the Mermaid Princess.</font>

440
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mermaid Princess is the youngest, and her
big brothers are the three princes you met earlier.</font>

441
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, but something bothers me.</font>

442
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:28,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't Vander Decken that cursed pirate from several hundred years ago?</font>

443
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!</font>

444
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, legends are often
exaggerations of exaggerations.</font>

445
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that he did exist,</font>

446
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the Vander Decken from the legend was just a man who reached this island and lived in the country.</font>

447
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, the ship you encountered
was probably the real Flying Dutchman...</font>

448
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the captain was just his descendant!</font>

449
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Va-</font>

450
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken the ninth!</font>

451
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  His descendant?!</font>

452
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,070
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Fish Taxi</font>

453
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's how it is?  So he wasn't a ghost after all.</font>

454
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being only bones, and thinking I had met a real ghost, I was starting to feel more dead than alive.</font>

455
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness.
If nothing else, I am truly happy about that.</font>

456
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie... Caimie... Caimie...</font>

457
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!  Now that I look closely, there are
so many different kinds of merfolk and fishmen!</font>

458
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are old lady mermaids down there too!
They're just like old Kokoro!</font>

459
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look over there!  Those are babies!</font>

460
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their father is a fishman,
but his kids are both merfolk and fishmen.</font>

461
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Basically, if a fishman and a mermaid get married, they can have sons and daughters of either race.</font>

462
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, there are four possible outcomes.</font>

463
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's why there are so many different types!</font>

464
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's cool!</font>

465
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're getting on the high-speed current now.</font>

466
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is so fast!</font>

467
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What's that?</font>

468
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, that's the candy factory.</font>

469
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not what I meant.
Why is there a pirate-flag on it?</font>

470
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that?  There's one at the bay
and at the entrance to the island too.</font>

471
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island is currently
under the protection of that pirate flag.</font>

472
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the mark of the New World pirate
Charlotte Linlin.</font>

473
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also known as Big Mom.  One of the Four Emperors!</font>

474
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before the war, this island was protected from pirates by Whitebeard's name.</font>

475
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, Big Mom is watching over it.</font>

476
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

477
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In exchange, we have to give her
large amounts of candy every month.</font>

478
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what the factory is for.</font>

479
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Candy?</font>

480
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we're not protected by someone great like that,</font>

481
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the country would never survive.</font>

482
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would become too dangerous here, since it's like the pirates' highway.</font>

483
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if this Big Mom is protecting you in old man Whitebeard's place, she must be nice, right?</font>

484
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hard to say... At least Whitebeard never asked for compensation.</font>

485
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps Big Mom just thinks of it like business?</font>

486
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Mom, huh?  One of the Four Emperors,
just like Shanks.</font>

487
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if I'll meet her someday?</font>

488
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look up ahead!</font>

489
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have reached the city of celebrities,
Fishverly Hills!</font>

490
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That huge building right in front of us
is Pappagg's house!</font>

491
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That?!  But he's just a starfish!</i></font>

492
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,930
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Coral Hill</font>

493
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad.</font>

494
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that the Madame from the Mermaid Café?</font>

495
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong, Madame Shyarly?</font>

496
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you so upset?</font>

497
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't act quickly, something terrible will happen!</font>

498
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Madame... What do you mean?</font>

499
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go look for him!</font>

500
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirate-boy wearing a straw hat...</font>

501
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chase him out of the kingdom, right now!</font>

502
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this another prediction?</font>

503
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't intend to look...</font>

504
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I felt something from him, and ended up taking a peek...</font>

505
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">at his future!</font>

506
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?!  What did you see?!</font>

507
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Madame?!</font>

508
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shyarly?!</font>

509
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let it be wrong!  Please, let my prediction be wrong!</font>

510
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The human with the straw hat...</font>

511
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy...</font>

512
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By his hands...</font>

513
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island will...</font>

514
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">be destroyed!</font>
