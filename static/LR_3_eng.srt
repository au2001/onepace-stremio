<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I thought I'd watch too.</font>

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got a problem with that?</font>

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just some people will stoop to anything to help their team win</font>

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">while others might insist on a
fair-and-square contest, you know?</font>

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it depends on the situation.</font>

78
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if you can't even
handle a little interference</font>

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">how can you hope to survive
as a seafaring pirate?</font>

80
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a question of character.</font>

81
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how you justify it?</font>

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that team of yours anyway?!</font>

83
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can even call it a team!</font>

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Talk all you want! Once the match starts
you'll see what they can--!</font>

85
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You went too early just now!</font>

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did not! I win!</font>

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At everything.</font>

88
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be a smartass!</font>

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're talking about rock-paper-scissors here!</font>

90
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No you lost!</font>

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just decide on a ball man already!</font>

92
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They haven't even agreed on that yet...</font>

93
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun! That ball looks nice on you!</font>

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do it! I'm the ball man! I'm the worthiest!</font>

95
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It does suit you. You look like a prince.</font>

96

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just start the game!</font>

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! Weapons are against the rules! Lose the swords!</font>

99
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Really?</font>

100
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes this is a ball game!</font>

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It wouldn't be much of a game if weapons were allowed!</font>

102
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fine either way to be honest!</font>

103
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you gonna be okay?</font>

104
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A master swordsman without swords is...</font>

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,760

106
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...nothing but a worthless wimp.</font>

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knock it off you guys!</font>

108
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! It's now or never!</font>

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hats' ball man Sanji has entered the opponent's circle!</font>

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey cook, I hope you get trampled.</font>

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,480

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,320

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't hear ya!</font>

117
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,340

118
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C'mon man...</font>

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pay attention!</font>

120
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not that funny is it?</font>

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Groggy Monsters are as jolly as always!</font>

122
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get this delightful show on the road!</font>

123
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no time limit
and the first team to score wins!</font>

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we win if we knock Jumbo's
head into the other ring...</font>

125
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we lose if the cook's head
gets knocked into our ring...</font>

126
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can Team Straw Hat win back
the reindeer they lost in Round One?!</font>

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush 'em!</font>

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or will Team Foxy swipe
another crew member?!</font>

129
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're about to clash in Groggy Ring!</font>

130
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The whistle is about to sound!</font>

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let the game begin!</font>

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,200

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will he retreat or attack?!</font>

134
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it!</font>

138
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,170

139
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm only after you!</font>

140
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,690

on Big Pan's outstretched arm!</font>

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only natural though...</font>

146
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...for Big Pan is a slippery-skinned
wotan of loach origin!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

154
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their leader Hamburg
makes for the landing point!</font>

155
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With Roronoa Zoro racing by his side!</font>

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll chop you up if they score a goal!</font>

157

160
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile can Hamburg
catch Sanji in the air?!</font>

161
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! And then...!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

171
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bringing up the rear is Big Pan!</font>

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He rushes for the falling Hamburg!</font>

173
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,410

176
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stupid Eyebrows!</font>

179
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro! Sanji! Do something!</font>

180
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it about to end already?!</font>

181
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't need to tell me...!</font>

182
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't gonna... let 'em score!</font>

183
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ain't gonna score!</font>

184
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still in tip-top shape!</font>

185
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let that damn swordsman snub me...</font>

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...by saving...</font>

188
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No goal!</font>

189
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like ball man Sanji isn't going
to pass through the goal so easily!</font>

190
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mind your own damn business!</font>

191

Groggy Monsters has appeared!</font>

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have an epic game on our hands!</font>

194
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This has never happened before!
This is unprecedented!</font>

195
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These behemoths were sent
flying through the air!</font>

196
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crowd is stunned! Team Straw Hat is formidable!</font>

197
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't need you to give me backup!</font>

198
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's only 'cause I can't count on you!</font>

199
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're amazing!</font>

200
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They actually threw Pickles!</font>

201
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They sent Hamburg-san flying!</font>

202
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who asked for your help?!</font>

203
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You get tossed around too much!</font>

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! What are you doing Hamburg?!</font>

205
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lose and you'll regret it!</font>

206
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh but Team Straw Hat is acting strangely!</font>

207
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although the game is still going
with both ball men in bounds</font>

208
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the two teammates are
arguing instead of playing!</font>

209
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're funny!</font>

210
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro! Sanji! You idiots!</font>

211
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?! Now's your chance!</font>

212
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The other ball man's all alone!</font>

213
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gang up on him and knock him into the ring!</font>

214
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

215
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Pan goes in for a surprise attack!</font>

216
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa...!</font>

217
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too Bad Dance!</font>

218
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you running for?! He's the ball man!</font>

219
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah we know! But hang on, he has blades under his shoes!</font>

220
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Ref!</font>

221
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to "no weapons allowed"?!</font>

222
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! Can you be any more blatant?!</font>

223
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he misses a play it's out of his hands!</font>

224
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit screwing around Ref!</font>

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on Sanji-kun!</font>

226
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw the whole thing! Why are you sweatin' like a waterfall?!</font>

227
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I didn't s-see a th-thing...</font>

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Liar!</font>

229
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey hold on! He's the ref you know!</font>

230
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yellow card to Sanji of Team Straw Hat!</font>

231
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say what?!</font>

232
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait! Wait! Wait!</font>

233
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there's the yellow warning card!</font>

234
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One more and Sanji the cook
will get a red ejection card!</font>

235
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll eject you!</font>

236
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe he's scummy enough to attack the referee!</font>

237
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! I oughta knock you off!</font>

238
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a gangster!</font>

239
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We gotta do something about his weapons...</font>

240
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! You're allowing that now?!</font>

241
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just happen to be looking away...</font>

242
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look out there, Ref!</font>

243
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That idiot's using an axe now! An axe!</font>

244
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Stop! You can't afford to get ejected!</font>

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you kidding me?! I can't let
'em get away with this insanity!</font>

246
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you see?! They want you to get mad!</font>

247
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull yourself together!
This is for Chopper's sake!</font>

248
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Then I'll beat him up!</font>

249
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't go complicating things!</font>

250
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-kun! Just beat 'em!</font>

251
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pose of Love</font>

252
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't make any sense...</font>

253
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All right! Back to the game!</font>

254
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't have to start with that again!</font>

255
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is gettin' us nowhere!</font>

256
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we can change our game plan
now that we know they've got weapons!</font>

257
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to take him out!</font>

258
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay out of my way! I can handle him myself!</font>

259
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Work together! You're a team you know!</font>

260
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And there they go!
All three are about to collide!</font>

261
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't attack where his skin
is exposed! He's too slippery!</font>

262
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That leaves his hands
feet mask and trunks...</font>

263
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Loach Scooping Slide!</font>

264
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap!</font>

265
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Loach Racing Circus!</font>

266
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is! The Racing Circus acrobatics!</font>

267
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both opponents slide across his wide back!</font>

268
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ha! Won't work this time!
I can handle a little skating!</font>

269
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now they can't escape!</font>

270
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So dizzy...!</font>

271
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on you guys!</font>

272
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile the other two players
have gotten back into the game!</font>

273
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! They're back in it!
Slaughter 'em!</font>

274
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Their attire is a little different now!</font>

275
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hamburg, their leader is wearing iron knuckles and iron elbow guards!</font>

276
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile Pickles has donned
spiked shoulder protectors!</font>

277
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These clearly violate the "no weapons" rule!</font>

278
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but the referee just happens
to have his back turned right now,</font>

279
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">as he does some stretches!</font>

280
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I'm mad Leader!</font>

281
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes!</font>

282
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Loach Coaster!</font>

283
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything's spinning...!</font>

284
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it Leader!</font>

285
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

286
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spinning Tackle!</font>

287
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The recovered players counterattack!</font>

288
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But their target isn't the ball man... It's the swordsman Roronoa!</font>

289
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're sniping him with the iron knuckles!</font>

290
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hamburger Hammer!</font>

291
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

292
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The attack isn't over yet! Big Pan instantly takes an attack stance!</font>

293
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hamburg prepares to use
his iron elbow guards!</font>

294
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

295
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It can't be...</font>

296
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is truly dangerous! A horrifying combo!</font>

297
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's almost like...</font>

298
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...an arrow!</font>

299
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Punk Attack!</font>

300
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

301
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It connects! Direct hit!</font>

302
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Note that deaths in Groggy Ring are
to be expected and are of no concern.</font>

303
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... dizzy...</font>

304
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Team Foxy isn't ready to stop its attack yet!</font>

305
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Human...</font>

306
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cannon!</font>

307
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ugh... I feel sick...</font>

308
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The spiked shoulder protector draws near!</font>

309
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji! Get out of the way!</font>

310
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sling Tackle!</font>

311
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're setting up Sanji the ball man now!</font>

312
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Size Attack: S!</font>

313
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hamburg sends him flying back!
They're not preparing to score at all!</font>

314
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M!</font>

315
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L!</font>

316
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Groggy Monsters unleash a spectacular team attack!</font>

317
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just terrible...</font>

318
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

319
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

320
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like Team Straw Hat
isn't getting up from this!</font>

321
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Piece o' cake!</font>

322
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The opponents literally are "groggy"!</font>

323
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All that remains now is to stuff
the ball man into his ring coffin,</font>

324
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and this will be two wins in a row!</font>

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The undefeated Groggy Monsters
are supremely powerful!</font>

326
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We win again!</font>

327
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey cook...</font>

328
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lend me a hand for ten seconds...</font>

329
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sounds like... a reasonable length of time...</font>

330
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Look!</font>

331
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wha...?!</font>

332
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're up! Team Straw Hat is standing again!</font>

333
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roronoa the swordsman and Sanji
the cook are terrifyingly tough!</font>

334
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They really know how to make a game exciting!</font>

335
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're back up! Now get those jerks!</font>

336
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But do these two have
enough strength left to fight?!</font>

337
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you guys...</font>

338
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One Monster Burger please!</font>

339
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh-What?!</font>

340
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could that mean?</font>

341
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our boss has just ordered a Monster Burger!</font>

342
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on! They're clearly using weapons now!</font>

343
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grind 'em up like a burger patty...</font>

344
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And slice 'em good like fresh pickles...</font>

345
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are the guests?!</font>

346
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Green lettuce... and yellow cheese!</font>

347
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush it all between big pans and you get...</font>

348
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...a Monster Burger!</font>

349
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is! Their utterly
horrific triple weapon attack!</font>

350
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no escape! Foul play
like this clearly calls for red cards!</font>

351
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Team Straw Hat is in a tough bind!</font>

352
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but wouldn't you know!</font>

353
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:10,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ref just happens to have
his back turned as he stretches!</font>

354
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

355
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop Luffy!</font>

356
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...!</font>

357
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They want us to butt in!</font>

358
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to grin and bear it Luffy!</font>

359
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything's set! The Groggy
Monsters commence their attack!</font>

360
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever happens now don't blame me!</font>

361
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally they go after Sanji the ball man!</font>

362
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will he be ground up sliced
and crushed into a hamburger patty?!</font>

363
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't make much with
third-rate ingredients like you guys</font>

364
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I'll cook each and every one of you!</font>

365
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're mincemeat now!</font>

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Troisième...</font>

367
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Third Rate</i></font>

368
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's fast!</font>

369
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Haché!</font>

370
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Mincemeat</i></font>

371
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bouquetiere...</font>

372
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Mixed Vegetables</i></font>

373
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Shot!</font>

374
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no!</font>

375
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop crushing!</font>

376
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leader!</font>

377
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you...?!</font>

378
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget this is a team battle.</font>

379
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...!</font>

380
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cut you up!</font>

381
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No-Sword Style...</font>

382
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Dragon</font>

383
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Twister</font>

384
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-My word! Big Pan has fallen
victim to Pickles' spinning blades!</font>

385
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Dammit...!</font>

386
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bad Manner...</font>

387
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Kick Course!</font>

388
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-Incredible!</font>

389
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gigantic Big Pan was falling over
but is now upright again!</font>

390
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A tremendous kick has kept
Big Pan on his feet and in a daze!</font>

391
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Now Zoro the swordsman charges in!</font>

392
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally he's going after
Big Pan the ball man!</font>

393
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not getting past me!</font>

394
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've had enough of you and the ref!</font>

395
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crowd-- no the referee-- takes a direct hit!</font>

396
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was on purpose...!</font>

397
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare he... hurt the ref...?!</font>

398
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Red card!</font>

399
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

400
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My cards and whistle... They're gone...</font>

401
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,280
