00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard he's the most evil one!</font>

136
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The plan is already in action.</font>

137
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What plan?</font>

138
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, tell us about the plan!
Get together, everybody!</font>

139
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We formed an alliance
to take down one of the Four Emperors?!</font>

140
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Four Emperors, huh?
It's great!</font>

141
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's not!</font>

142
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, wait! Let's calm down, everybody!</font>

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, tell them about the alliance.</font>

144
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! We and Tra-guy's pirate group
formed an alliance!</font>

145
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's be nice to each other!</font>

146
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does anybody wanna oppose this?!</font>

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--I do!
--I do!</font>

148
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it make any difference?</font>

149
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy's mind is already set, isn't it?</font>

150
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

151
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I have to warn you.</font>

152
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There may be a slight difference between</font>

153
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">how you define "alliance" and how Luffy defines it.</font>

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful.</font>

155
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why Luffy kept saying "kidnap"...</font>

156
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">which was so out of character for him.</font>

157
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he had just come to me
with that strange sheep</font>

158
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and asked me to cook it, I
wouldn't know what to do.</font>

159
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastards.
You're not gonna get away with this.</font>

160
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Extraordinarily big names 
will hunt you down!</font>

161
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiots!</font>

162
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Realize how stupid you are! Go to hell!</font>

163
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji! I was in the 
middle of his treatment!</font>

164
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait until I finish it.</font>

165
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

166
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I asked you guys to kidnap 
Caesar at Punk Hazard.</font>

167
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile, I destroyed 
the machine which was</font>

168
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">manufacturing a substance called SAD.</font>

169
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The great pirates in the New World
often have their own territory.</font>

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They lead countless numbers of people
and reign like a syndicate.</font>

171
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nothing like what 
you've seen before.</font>

172
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One pirate group is never strong enough
even to see their captain's face.</font>

173
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But since it's an underground community,</font>

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they have to do their businesses secretly
to avoid the Navy.</font>

175
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Doflamingo is the most trusted 
and powerful man among them.</font>

176
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His underground alias is Joker.</font>

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Joker's most important 
business partner now is...</font>

178
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...one of the Four Emperors,
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.</font>

179
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our target.</font>

180
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! K-Kaido?!</font>

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kaido?!</font>

182
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the matter?</font>

183
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never mind. Go on.</font>

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is there a dragon here?!
Where did Momonosuke go?!</font>

185
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's him.</font>

186
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kaido of the Four Emperors.</font>

187
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to take him down,
we have to weaken his forces.</font>

188
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kaido is buying a large amount 
of fruit from Joker now.</font>

189
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a Zoan-type, man-made,
devil fruit called SMILE.</font>

190
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Man-made?!</font>

191
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If such a thing exists,</font>

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the number of devil fruit
eaters will keep multiplying!</font>

193
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

194
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since it's man-made, however,</font>

195
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it seems like there are some risks involved.</font>

196
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, in fact, Kaido has
more than 500 devil fruit</font>

197
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">eaters in his pirate group.</font>

198
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who doesn't wanna do this?! I don't!</font>

199
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--I don't!
--I don't!</font>

200
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up.</font>

201
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the devil fruit eaters
won't multiply anymore.</font>

202
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? Him?</font>

203
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you making a substance
for the man-made devil fruit?</font>

204
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How cool! SAD!</font>

205
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't praise him!</font>

206
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just put Vegapunk's discovery 
of "lineage factor" into practice.</font>

207
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Vegapunk is the smart one.</font>

208
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you bastards!
Can you fools even make it?!</font>

209
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Joker is finished.</font>

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go onto the next move.</font>

211
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a factory manufacturing SMILEs
somewhere on Dressrosa.</font>

212
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should just find it and destroy it?</font>

213
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, he's a professional 
businessman.</font>

215
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure he'll retaliate.</font>

216
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that where you wanna go, Kin?</font>

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!</font>

218
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A comrade of mine is captured there!</font>

219
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh!?</font>

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Stop it, please!
--Smo-yan's gonna die!</font>

221
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you kill him,</font>

222
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who would lead misfits like us!?</font>

223
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry.</font>

224
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no way to find 
out who knows what.</font>

225
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why, Law,
Straw Hat, and you soldiers,</font>

226
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna kill you all!</font>

227
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

228
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa-whoa.</font>

229
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me, young man.</font>

230
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you step aside?</font>

231
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What!?</font>

232
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is my...</font>

233
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">friend.</font>

234
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the former admiral - Aokiji?!</font>

235
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young Master!</font>

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young Master-<i>sama</i>!</font>

237
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Thank god-<i>dasuyan</i>!</font>

238
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't get frozen to the bone!</font>

239
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young Master-<i>sama</i>!</font>

240
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smo-yan!</font>

241
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not interested in fighting you.</font>

242
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if I can't silence that guy,</font>

243
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to change my plan.</font>

244
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can I ask you something?</font>

245
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, now...</font>

246
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">where do you stand, Kuzan?!</font>

247
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your reputation is sullied.</font>

248
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, treat him already!</font>

249
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes, sir!</font>

250
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The face of a mere wanderer...</font>

251
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and that of a man with determination...</font>

252
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they're quite different.</font>

253
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought that the World 
Government was almighty.</font>

254
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are things I can do
without belonging to the Navy.</font>

255
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are things I can see now
because I'm not part of the Navy.</font>

256
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was dead for a moment.</font>

257
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe I was fated to come here.</font>

258
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What brought you here?</font>

259
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I came here to see you.</font>

260
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you know that I'd be here?</font>

261
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me...</font>

262
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you have something to do with
the underground community now?</font>

263
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-The former admiral has
something to do with...</font>

264
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're done with the 
treatment, go away!</font>

265
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still me, Smoker.</font>

266
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I have no qualms.</font>

267
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, you guys should 
keep an eye on Doflamingo.</font>

268
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a Warlord and the 
king of Dressrosa.</font>

269
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's an unusual pirate in many ways</font>

270
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but not like the Snake Princess of the Kuja.</font>

271
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tell Sakazuki to get the 
admirals into action.</font>

272
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the worst-case scenario,
things could go very wrong, very quickly,</font>

273
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and it would become the most 
serious matter Sakazuki faced</font>

274
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since taking over Navy HQ.</font>

275
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've warned you.</font>

276
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, guys!</font>

277
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to keep this...</font>

278
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean... you know.</font>

279
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was it?</font>

280
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I forgot. Who cares.</font>

281
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a secret that we met you, got it!</font>

282
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,880
<font face="impress bt" size="45">That night, out at sea</font>

283
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's already late! No one has come!</font>

284
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sir! I didn't see anybody!</font>

285
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh. Good job!</font>

286
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, sir!</font>

287
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, do you think they
can still find us?</font>

288
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many people are looking for us?!
Tens of thousands?</font>

289
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't stop worrying
since I heard you blackmailed Doflamingo!</font>

290
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me, neither, you fool!</font>

291
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kin gave us armor and some helmets.
Just let it go!</font>

292
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Resign from the Warlords
or fight one of the Emperors.</font>

293
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can choose between those options.
He'll just come to kill us.</font>

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared!</font>

295
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard! Fight me squarely!</font>

296
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

297
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said it's a long story!</font>

298
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--Cut it out!
--Stop!</font>

299
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on! It's dangerous
to fight on the ship!</font>

300
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, are you playing samurai?!
Fight, fight!</font>

301
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be ashamed of yourself!
The whole country was left heartbroken!</font>

302
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The grave of the Wano Kingdom's hero,
left plundered by a thief!</font>

303
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was you!</font>

304
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said I didn't do it!</font>

305
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must have! You have
that legendary swordsman...</font>

306
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ryuma's great sword Shusui on your belt!</font>

307
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, come on! Fight, fight!
Just cut him already!</font>

308
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who wants to eat a midnight snack?</font>

309
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! What is it?!</font>

310
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pizza.</font>

311
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Pida"?</font>

312
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:59,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what that is
but if he cooked it, it should be good.</font>

313
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did Momonosuke go to bed already?</font>

314
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's taking a bath with Robin.</font>

315
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

316
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You haven't taken a bath
for days, have you?</font>

317
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nope.</font>

318
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you get all warmed up?</font>

319
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh-huh. Not bad.</font>

320
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You came at just the right time!</font>

321
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">
Kin'emon-<i>san</i>, he needs a kimono.</font>

322
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing, you dirty brat!</font>

323
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not fair!</font>

324
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're taking full advantage 
of being a child!</font>

325
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just cut off your top-knot!</font>

326
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Why did you gang up on a child?!</font>

327
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No, it's not what you think, Nami-<i>san</i>!</font>

328
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Men are all...</font>

329
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was scared, beautiful princess!</font>

330
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful princess?!
Don't be so honest!</font>

331
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're such a lovely boy!</font>

332
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You sleep in our room, Momo-<i>chan</i>!</font>

333
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

334
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They'll let him in the girls' 
room - the secret garden?!</font>

335
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

336
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the worst, you brat!</font>

337
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo! I know he's gonna make a raid in the darkness of the night!</font>

338
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just bring it on! I mean, don't!</font>

339
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't sleep!</font>

340
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm all the way to the horizon!</font>

341
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The morning paper!</font>

342
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Donquixote Doflamingo..."</font>

343
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,560

344
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,980

345
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"And abdicates the throne of Dressrosa"!?
What the hell!?</font>

346
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-"Throne" means he was a king?!</font>

347
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A king?!</font>

348
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then it must be a birds' kingdom!</font>

349
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When things go this well, 
it's kind of scary.</font>

350
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is good. He had no choice.</font>

351
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, why are our 
faces here as well?</font>

352
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"The Warlord - Trafalgar Law..."</font>

with the Straw Hats"?</font>

354

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"It is still unknown what the 
Government will do to Law." It says!</font>

355
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's so much going
on in today's paper!</font>

356
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,070
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Various places in the world</font>

357
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo quits the Warlords and 
Law and Straw Hat join forces!</font>

358
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And these guys, too!</font>

359
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Kid!</font>

360

362
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kid Pirates, the On Air Pirates,</font>

363
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the Hawkins Pirates have
formed a pirate alliance, too?!</font>

364
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were the troublemakers...</font>

365
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that everyone kept an eye
on for last two years...</font>

366
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and now they've joined
forces all at once!</font>

367
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is something about to
happen in the New World?!</font>

368
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They formed an alliance, too, huh?</font>

369
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if they're thinking 
the same thing as us.</font>

370
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forget about them.</font>

371
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna go on with the plan.</font>

372
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Focus on Doflamingo for now.</font>

373
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now you know how important yesterday's 
negotiation was for him.</font>

374
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All we did was kidnap Caesar.</font>

375
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In contrast, seemingly overnight, he gave up...</font>

377
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the carte blanche given to him 
as a privilege of being a Warlord.</font>

378
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He did it just to get this 
guy back and that says a lot!</font>

379
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,890
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa.
In response to Doflamingo's sudden abdication...</font>

380
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King!</font>

381
