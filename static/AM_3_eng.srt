<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you could give me a ship!</font>

77
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd appreciate getting a lift most of all,</font>

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's appalling!</font>

86
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't think you can leave this place alive.</font>

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your death is inescapable!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait Snake Princess!</font>

89
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I don't think he's the

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Tell her for me!</font>

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A defense warrior?</font>

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Marguerite!</font>

98
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The punishment of the crime of intruding into this kingdom,</font>

99
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">which is forbidden to men, is death.</font>

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you defending him?</font>

101
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel I owe him.</font>

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The person who let him into this country...</font>

103
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...was I!</font>

104
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marguerite! Why?!</font>

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess! W-We can explain!</font>

106
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

107
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We found him in the forest
covered in mushrooms!</font>

108
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought he was from the village
and carried him here!</font>

109
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sweet Pea! Aphelandra!</font>

110
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're also responsible for
the crime of bringing him here!</font>

111
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

112
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop you two!</font>

113
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one who suggested
bringing him to the village!</font>

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does she know what this means?</font>

115
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marguerite is way too honest!</font>

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh you guys!</font>

117
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys tried to kill me
but you're actually nice after all!</font>

118
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only I'm guilty of letting
him into the country!</font>

119
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marguerite!</font>

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all right.</font>

121
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look up, honest Marguerite.</font>

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Love-Love Beam!</font>

123
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?!</font>

124
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They did something stupid.</font>

125
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what happened to you?!</font>

126
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?!</font>

127
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They turned into stone! Why?!</font>

128
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what did you do to them!?</font>

129
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They saved my life!</font>

130
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, they have been punished for helping you.</font>

131
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of me!?</font>

132
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Turn them back to normal!</font>

133
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring Bacura to the arena!</font>

134
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bacura!?</font>

135
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all over for that man now!</font>

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to turn them back!</font>

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is the kingdom of the warriors, Amazon Lily,</font>

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">where if you are powerful, you are beautiful.</font>

139
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should die fighting.</font>

140
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are gonna watch it.</font>

141
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That black panther's name is Bacura.</font>

142
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is a carnivorous animal that was used as an executioner</font>

143
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by the empress of this kingdom for many generations.</font>

144
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After the execution, not even a single bone will remain.</font>

145
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's gonna happen to these people?! Are they gonna turn back to normal?!</font>

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a disrespectful way of speaking to the Snake Princess!</font>

147
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go finish him, Bacura!</font>

148
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bacura!</font>

149
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's strong!</font>

150
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bacura was defeated by a single hit?!</font>

151
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He didn't use Haki!</font>

152
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then that was just brute strength?!</font>

153
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are screwed up.</font>

154
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman...</font>

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after your comrades have been turned to stone by that woman,</font>

156
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">why are you still laughing childishly?!</font>

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The savage is shouting at us!</font>

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable! What a vicious creature!</font>

159
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We feel sorry for those three, but what Snake Princess did wasn't wrong!</font>

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're the ones to blame!
They broke the rules of our land!</font>

161
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever I do...</font>

162
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...I will be forgiven.</font>

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you ask why...</font>

164
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed...</font>

165
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's because I'm beautiful!</font>

166
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

167
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You think so, too, right?</font>

168
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're pissin' me off.</font>

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sister, get a hold of yourself!</font>

170
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is just ridiculous!</font>

171
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There can't possibly exist a man that can't be captured by my charm!</font>

172
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't bear that man's existence!</font>

173
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you say that to the Snake Princess?!</font>

174
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and execute him!</font>

175
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution!</font>

176
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution! Execution!</font>

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go! Marigold! Sandersonia!</font>

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that man's head!</font>

179
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Leave it to us Big Sis!</font>

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys use devil-fruit powers, too?</font>

181
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution!</font>

182
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution!</font>

183
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The younger sisters'
Snake Pit Dance is about to start!</font>

184
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait to see Marigold-sama's
"Salamander" with my own eyes!</font>

185
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,310
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Youngest Sister Marigold Snake-Snake
Fruit Model King Cobra</font>

186
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Sandersonia-sama's
"Eight-Headed Serpent"!</font>

187
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,990
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Middle Sister Sandersonia
Snake-Snake Fruit Model Anaconda</font>

188
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How magnificent she looks!</font>

189
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is proof that they defeated
the monster, Gorgon, and took its powers!</font>

190
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after they were cursed, the sisters are still beautiful!</font>

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cursed?</font>

192
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they talking about?</font>

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter how you look at it, you just ate a Devil Fruit!</font>

194
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution! Execution!</font>

195
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Execution!...</font>

196
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps I should swallow him whole...</font>

197
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or squeeze him to death...</font>

198
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me he's scared stiff!</font>

199
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just stand there and die!</font>

200
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There!</font>

201
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They don't have any cracks, right?</font>

202
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You three wait here.</font>

203
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry about this. Because of me you guys turned into stone.</font>

204
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Chopper was here, I'd ask him to check on you right away.</font>

205
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like when Robin and I were turned into ice by Aokiji.</font>

206
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys might be able to turn back to normal.</font>

207
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own safety instead of theirs?</font>

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! I can do whatever I want!</font>

209
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man...</font>

210
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he trying to save Marguerite and the others?</font>

211
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That can't be!</font>

212
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's already been sentenced to death!</font>

213
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then...</font>

214
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, I just gotta beat you guys up, right?</font>

215
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did that boy just say?</font>

217
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He thinks he can beat the sisters up?</font>

218
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hilarious! Making people laugh
after being sentenced to death!</font>

219
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men really are hilarious!</font>

220
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can do that, right? Beat you up, I mean.</font>

221
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, sure you can.</font>

222
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you haven't given up on your life yet, let me tell you something.</font>

223
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't fall into the pit between
the seats and the ring if I were you!</font>

224
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't mind if it happens, but if you fall, you will be stabbed by the spikes below.</font>

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, let's start.</font>

226
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill him, Sandersonia, Marigold!</font>

227
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the crime of intruding on this island of women!</font>

228
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the sin of insulting me,</font>

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">show him the art of the punishment!</font>

230
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been waiting for this!</font>

231
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take that, and that, and that!</font>

232
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's not bad at this huh?</font>

233
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get him Marigold-sama!</font>

234
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?!</font>

235
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poison?! That was close!</font>

236
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a deadly poison! Too bad for you!</font>

237
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stamp!</font>

239
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It bounced off!</font>

240
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurts!</font>

241
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How...?! I'm made of rubber!</font>

242
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See! He really is all bark and no bite!</font>

243
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's true that men stretch! Interesting!</font>

244
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?! Am I not rubber anymore?!</font>

245
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No that's not it!</font>

246
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then why do impact blows hurt?!</font>

247
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's unfair.</font>

248
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't hog all the fun yourself, Mari.</font>

249
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to have some fun with him too!</font>

250
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does that hurt?! I'm made of rubber!</font>

251
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The guy with the battle-axe was like that, too...</font>

252
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean it's not a Devil Fruit power?</font>

253
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I take it you have powers too.</font>

254
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I take it you can't use Haki?</font>

256
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most outsiders can't.</font>

257
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why you're weak.</font>

258
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A kick with the left foot.</font>

259
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over here!</font>

260
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She predicted my move!</font>

261
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Slam!</font>

262
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

263
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one didn't hurt.</font>

264
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Same as usual.</font>

265
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber...</font>

266
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

267
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Dance!</font>

268
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What amazing moves!</font>

269
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With Sonia-sama's Haki
there's no attack she can't dodge!</font>

270
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're very straightforward.</font>

271
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can read you like a book.</font>

272
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

273
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's guessing my every move!</font>

274
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Focusing entirely on offense
is nice and all but...</font>

275
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Stick!</font>

276
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch!</font>

277
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget that there are two of us!</font>

278
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's falling into the pit!</font>

279
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was close!</font>

280
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess put
her hair behind her ear!</font>

281
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her loveliness knows no bounds!</font>

282
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This man is the very definition
of "nothing but talk."</font>

283
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't help but laugh.</font>

284
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up you dumbass!</font>

285
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my!</font>

286
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He spoke abusively to
the Snake Princess again!</font>

287
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unforgivable! Hurry and kill him!</font>

288
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sonia! Mari!</font>

289
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">End that man's life at once!</font>

290
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To ensure there are no further outbursts...</font>

291
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">from his filthy mouth!</font>

292
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like playtime is over now.</font>

293
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's give the criminal despair and death!</font>

294
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! What're you doing?! Don't touch them!</font>

295
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if she breaks?!</font>

296
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She saved my life you know!</font>

297
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are going to break her.</font>

298
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said she saved your life.</font>

299
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then that's all the more reason to.</font>

300
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel bad for her, but this is your punishment.</font>

301
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be stupid!</font>

302
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This duel is between me and you!</font>

303
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! Let go!</font>

304
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the only one who
thinks this is a duel.</font>

305
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a public execution!</font>

306
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just sit there and watch!</font>

307
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The emotional trauma you gave our
sister goes much further than this!</font>

308
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Everyone here looks up to the Snake Princess!</i></font>

309
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>She's strong noble and the most
beautiful woman in the world!</i></font>

310
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Pirate Empress Boa Hancock!</i></font>

311
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Stop it!</font>

312
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She looked up to you guys you know!</font>

313
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone in this land does.</font>

314
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I think this is what she would want!</font>

315
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hell it is!</font>

316
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you stupid?!</font>

317
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my. What crude language.</font>

318
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here goes!</font>

319
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three...</font>

320
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Stop!</font>

321
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two...</font>

322
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use.</font>

323
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One...</font>

324
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marguerite!</font>

325
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you to stop, dammit!!</font>

326
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The warriors are fainting!</font>

327
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way...</font>

328
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief!</font>

329
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She isn't hurt anywhere!</font>

330
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh I guess you guys are sensible after all!</font>

331
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now... that was the Conqueror's Haki!</font>

332
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This can't be real!</font>

333
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only one in a million people is capable of using the Haki of the chosen ones.</font>

334
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen any person who
can use it other than our big sister!</font>

335
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This boy has the qualities of a king,
capable of standing above all others!</font>

336
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has the Conqueror's Haki just like me?</font>

337
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?!</font>

338
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he no mere boy after all?!</font>

339
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just who is that guy?!</font>

340
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's everyone blabbing about?</font>

341
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the big deal?</font>

342
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't realize he used Haki?!</font>

343
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess he hasn't figured
out how to control it.</font>

344
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

345
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You showed me you're strong!</font>

346
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now let's get on with the duel.</font>
