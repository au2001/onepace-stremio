00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa, and meanwhile...</font>

135
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">there is a fighting bull running out of control,
showing no fear for all those tough contenders!</font>

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a killer bull who slayed 21 death row prisoners during a fight in this very Colosseum!</font>

137
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!</font>

138
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People call him Brutal Bull, the extraordinary cow!</font>

139
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And somehow, someone has managed to tame this grim reaper!</font>

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bursting into prominence, with his cool strength, he has instantly became a crowd favorite! </font>

141
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forward, Ucy!</font>

143
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like that guy, too!</font>

144
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatz-san, you should be unbiased!</font>

145
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good boy! Go, go! Take them all down!</font>

146
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even hiding his face, he becomes popular! Straw Hat!</font>

148
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a funny guy.</font>

149
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go Ucy!</font>

150
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, they've challenged Hajrudin!</font>

151
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you wanna fight me?</font>

152
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, crap! Run, Ucy!</font>

153
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ucy!</font>

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bull!</font>

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bull!</font>

156
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

157
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was fast!</font>

158
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The difference in power was evident!</font>

159
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In front of the rookie from Elbaf...</font>

160
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Colosseum's Grim Reaper and the unknown gladiator, Lucy, were...</font>

161
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Gatz-san!</font>

162
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">didn't stand a chance...</font>

163
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

164
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The giant has been knocked down!</font>

165
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was awesome, Lucy!</font>

166
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't help getting more excited as we go on!</font>

167
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He came in and stirred things up in Block C!</font>

168
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy did it again!</font>

169
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me carry you to the side of the ring, Ucy.</font>

170
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I believe this man still has a lot more to show!</font>

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was obvious.</font>

172
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm astonished... I didn't expect him to be that strong.</font>

173
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lucy!</font>

174
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, giant man. This is a ring.</font>

175
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you wanna take a nap, find a bed!</font>

176
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hajrudin's enormous body was blown away by an explosion?!</font>

177
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What just happened?!</font>

178
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it wasn't an explosion!</font>

179
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hajrudin got eliminated, but
Block C still has many strong fighters!</font>

180
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a punch that looked like an explosion, powered by those odd-shaped shoulders!</font>

181
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ideo!</font>

182
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who blew away the Giant's huge body was...</font>

183
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:05,070
<font face="impress bt" size="45">XXX Rank Boxer
Destruction Cannon Ideo</font>

184
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the two-time champion of the
New World Central Fighting Tournament!</font>

185
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,290

186
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, that's not the only fight you want to keep an eye on! </font>

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, take a look!</font>

188
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:24,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The gang of three from the Flower Country in the far east are very unique, too!</font>

189
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!</font>

190
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There you go!</font>

191
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't protect yourself from it!</font>

192
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,530
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Flower Country Gang Member
 13th Commander of the Happou Navy - Sai</font>

193
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,350

194
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shields and armor are useless against them!</font>

195
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With centuries of history, the Happou Navy is...</font>

198
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we are able to kill you,</font>

199
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it's going to be almost as big as winning the prize of this competition, Chinjao!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boy...</font>

203
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,350
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Don Chinjao</font>

204
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was Conqueror's Haki!</font>

205
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wonder.</font>

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used to be a legendary pirate worth 500 million!</font>

207
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is only one man that I want to fight, don't get in my way!</font>

208
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Chinjao!
There are so many nice weapons to choose from now!</font>

209
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa!</font>

210
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That man didn't get beaten by Don Chinjao's Haki</font>

211
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And he's picking up weapons in the ring!</font>

212
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,010
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Bounty Hunter - Jean Ango
Jean the Bandit</font>

213
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is a dark horse in this competition, Jean the Bandit!</font>

214
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bounty hunter that all big-time pirates in the New World hold a grudge against!</font>

215
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, you shithead!</font>

216
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that I found you, your time is up!</font>

217
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't forgive you for sending my partner to prison!</font>

218
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My bullets are weapons I've picked up.</font>

219
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a sniper!</font>

220
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that partner guy was so important to you,</font>

221
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you should've shown spirit like you were raiding a prison! </font>

222
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There was an idiot like that two years ago.</font>

223
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! That guy has already passed out!</font>

224
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How long will he keep punching him?!</font>

225
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop, brother! He's already knocked out!</font>

226
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough!</font>

227
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I restrained the wrong person.</font>

228
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This bastard! He called me shrimp!</font>

229
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Bobby, am I a shrimp?! Huh?!</font>

230
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,070
<font face="impress bt" size="45">From the Mogaro Kingdom
Assassins - The Funk Brothers</font>

231
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,750

232
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say something, you octopus!</font>

233
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother! That's enough!</font>

234
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I restrained the wrong person.</font>

235
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I ever hear you say it again, I'll gouge your eyes out!</font>

Bobby</font>

239
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is a competition, brother.</font>

240
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Funk Brothers are so brutal!</font>

241
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're assassins who are well known in the underground community!</font>

242
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard they're very powerful fighters and they've even
killed some pirates worth over 100 million!</font>

243
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I don't care if it's a competition or not! I'm not short!</font>

244
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These guys are annoying.</font>

245
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just an untrained amateur boxer.</font>

246
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see what you've got!</font>

247
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, shrimp!</font>

248
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother!</font>

249
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

250
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How weak!</font>

251
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, maybe the Happou Navy people are too strong!</font>

252
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a disappointment!</font>

253
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not a powerful fighter at all, you idiot! You fool!</font>

254
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatz-san!</font>

255
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're next, younger brother!</font>

256
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! I won't fight.</font>

257
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never gotten into a fight in my entire life!</font>

258
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go to hell!</font>

259
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He turned his back?! These brothers are the worst!</font>

260
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The axe broke!</font>

261
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The axe was even infused with Armament Haki!</font>

262
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How tough is his body?!</font>

263
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brother.</font>

264
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That bastard called me a shrimp.</font>

265
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just put it on already, Bobby!</font>

266
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

267
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boo!</font>

268
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boo from the Flower Country is taking quite a beating!</font>

269
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's already passed out!</font>

270
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's punching him?!
Is that the wimpy younger brother Bobby?!</font>

271
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or the weak older brother Kelly?!</font>

272
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's the older one!</font>

273
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got bigger and looks like a different man!</font>

274
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did you call shrimp? Try saying it this time,</font>

275
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will chew a hole in your throat!</font>

276
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! Lucy's helmet got knocked off!</font>

277
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, give it back!</font>

278
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard this strange story, Lucy.</font>

279
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard a pirate who's worth 400 million named Straw Hat Luffy is...</font>

280
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">secretly fighting in this competition.</font>

281
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don Chinjao is charging at something!</font>

282
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Garp, watch me!</font>

283
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to kill your grandson!</font>

284
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Block C! There are approximately 40 contenders remaining!</font>

285
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's narrowing down to the strongest!</font>

286
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's going to be the winner?!</font>
