<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did they get him?</font>

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're awesome!</font>

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The opponent is a Warlord.</font>

44
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can't beat him so easily.</font>

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can tell just from their expressions.</font>

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he really that different?</font>

47
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does that mean that he's his twin or something?</font>

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that is a possibility.</font>

49
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, if he was the real guy, then he would have instantly dodged our attacks.</font>

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, he's not shooting out shock waves, and he doesn't have pads.</font>

51
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if he's a fake, then that's a problem as well.</font>

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means that there are two people as strong as him.</font>

53
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You hurt me pretty badly...</font>

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But don't think that I'm the same as I was earlier!</font>

58
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have gotten this big and strong all of a sudden?</font>

59
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was Kizaru's laser!</font>

60
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you manage to put Kizaru's destructive power into Bartholomew Kuma's body...</font>

64
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, even three men worth over 100 million...</font>

65
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't possibly survive when they're up against a Warlord and an admiral!</font>

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rear admiral Drake...</font>

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, former rear admiral...</font>

68
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't you come here to see this?</font>

69
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you'd like to try fighting, then go ahead.</font>

70
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing how you know the circumstances already...</font>

71
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess you're just too terrified to try, right?</font>

72
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But try not to lose your cool, my flimsy little friends.</font>

73
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm here too, after all.</font>

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I just got to see another interesting thing...</font>

75
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the first time I've seen a rare, ancient Zoan-type.</font>

76
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm surprised to see that even you have red blood in your veins.</font>

77
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just saw something really unusual...</font>

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said that I'm here too, didn't I?</font>

79
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One after another...</font>

80
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seems like all you people worth over 100 million are monsters.</font>

81
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's pretty scary!</font>

82
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Phase of Demon Subjugation</font>

83
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He vanished!</font>

84
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-My eyes!</font>

85
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain Hawkins!</font>

86
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't see!</font>

87
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what kind of ability you possess, but you have a physical form...</font>

88
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I suppose you're not a Logia-type.</font>

89
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain!</font>

90
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!</font>

91
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's exceeded his damage limit!</font>

92
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really gonna die!</font>

93
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here's the first one...</font>

94
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good work making it this far in your long journey.</font>

95
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,470
Is this music reachin' you?

96
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,010
If you hear me, then tune in!

97
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,790
Navy admiral Kizaru!

98
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the "Roaring Tide"...</font>

99
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,830
Everybody, listen to my fighting music!

100
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

101
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,610
Here we go!

102
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,550
Check it out!

103
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I doubt a navy admiral would die from something like this, though...</font>

104
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, I sure got to see a lot of interesting stuff.</font>

105
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I'll be getting out of here now.</font>

106
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See ya!</font>

107
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's awful...</font>

108
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ooh, what a surprise...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mirror of Yata</font>

110
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh, what?</font>

111
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

112
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

113
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello?</font>

114
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, here it is.</font>

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Borsalino here.</font>

116
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man!</font>

117
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did have your baby snail-phone with you!</font>

118
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why didn't you contact me?!</font>

119
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Sentoumaru-kun!</font>

120
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't just say "Oh"!</font>

121
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing?!</font>

122
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've arrived on the island, right?!</font>

123
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, I couldn't get in touch with you, you see...</font>

124
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet you tried to talk into the black snail-phone again, right?!</font>

125
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you before, the black snail-phone on your arm is just for tapping!</font>

126
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh...</font>

127
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh...!</font>

128
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever!</font>

129
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hurry up and get back to work!</font>

130
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already identified our targets!</font>

131
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat Luffy, Captain Kid, and Trafalgar Law, who do you wanna start with?</font>

132
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, is that so?</font>

133
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then...</font>

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Were you really so badly injured that you can't move?</font>

138
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave him alone, Luffy!</font>

139
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta defeat this thing first!</font>

140
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

141
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way his wounds from back then could've healed completely...</font>

142
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From what I can see, just standing up to face the enemy must be really painful for him.</font>

143
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If this bastard isn't Bartholomew Kuma, then who is he?!</font>

144
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He looks exactly like one of the Seven Warlords...</font>

145
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is going on?!</font>

146
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro!</font>

147
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Split-Hoof</font>

148
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Roseo Blizzard</font>

149
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper!</font>

150
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong Hammer</font>

151
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky Boxing</font>

152
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spider Net</font>

153
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't take his physical strength lightly either!</font>

154
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take care!</font>

155
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here I go!</font>

156
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swallow</font>

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bond En Avant</font>

158
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-huh?</font>

159
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have stopped!</font>

160
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Wait, that's dangerous!</font>

161
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you planning on killing me?!</font>

162
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Though I'm already dead...</font>

163
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, this is no time to be saying that...!</font>

164
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure Kill Atlas Comet</font>

165
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now's our chance! Let's run!</font>

166
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was scary! Thank you so much!</font>

167
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? He's acting strangely...</font>

168
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What? Bombs work on him NOW?</font>

169
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One shot went inside his mouth... Something inside his body must have short-circuited...</font>

170
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His body might be tough, but he's still got blood on the inside.</font>

171
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's had his entire body modified to become a weapon, just like me...</font>

172
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but he's really a normal human!</font>

173
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, watch out! He's found you!</font>

174
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, no!</font>

175
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ochenta Fleurs</font>

176
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Eighty Flower</i></font>

178
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Four Hands</i></font>

179
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shock!</font>

180
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You did it! He fired off the beam inside his own mouth!</font>

181
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He self-destructed!</font>

182
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to interrupt your break, mister...</font>

183
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But you should watch out for lightning there!</font>

184
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From dark clouds to the Clima Tact...</font>

185
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thunder Lance Tempo!</font>

186
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That one definitely worked... Fantastic!</font>

187
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't work at all, did it?! He's still perfectly fine, isn't he?!</font>

188
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you get desperate, the fight is over.</font>

189
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, blast him over here!</font>

190
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too damn stubborn...</font>

191
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diable Jambe</font>

192
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flambage Shot!</font>

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Flambé Shot</i></font>

194
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! He's finally starting to fall apart!</font>

195
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Demonic Spirit</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nine Sword Style</font>

197
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Asura!</font>

198
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W... What is that?!</font>

199
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro multiplied?!</font>

200
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nine Demonic Flashes</font>

201
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gear Third!</font>

202
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go!</font>

203
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go, Luffy!</font>

204
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just need one more hit!</font>

205
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber</font>

206
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush him, Luffy!</font>

207
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Giant Rifle!</font>

208
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm shrinking!</font>

209
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We stopped that bastard, right?</font>

210
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must have...</font>

211
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It almost seems like he's gonna start moving again... Creepy...</font>

212
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he does, we're doomed.</font>

213
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm totally beat, I can't move anymore.</font>

214
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe we should've escaped, instead of trying to fight him?</font>

215
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, if we can beat him, then that's what we should do.</font>

216
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'd chase us wherever we went.</font>

217
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what was with that guy anyway?</font>

218
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's definitely a modified human...</font>

219
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means that he was once a human who looked just like Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

220
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd guess they were twins, or perhaps they just found someone who looked super similar...</font>

221
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose that's the most likely explanation.</font>

222
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way they could've actually created a human, after all.</font>

223
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">PX-4?</font>

224
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's rest for a bit...</font>

225
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought we'd be forced to go all-out in a battle so soon...</font>

226
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to rest, but we should find a hiding-place first.</font>

227
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they find us now, we're in big trouble, you know.</font>

228
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess that's true.</font>

229
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

230
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait just a minute, okay?</font>

231
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, you guys have really done it now!</font>

232
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Another enemy?!</font>

233
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd that voice come from?!</font>

234
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up there! They're up there!</font>

235
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's there?!</font>

236
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! What a pitiful state you're in, PX-4!</font>

237
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just building one of you Pacifista costs us as much as an entire warship!</font>

238
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, how am I supposed to explain this to that damn Punk?!</font>

239
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,270
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Navy Headquarters












Captain of the Science Patrol</font>

240
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,100
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Sentoumaru</font>

241
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another Warlord!</font>

242
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Don't tell me that's the real guy?!</font>

243
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doesn't matter whether he's real or a fake...</font>

244
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have the strength to stand up to that thing again!</font>

245
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He just said "Pacifista"...</font>

246
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Pacifista"... That's like someone who creates peace, right?</font>

247
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the name of the one we just defeated?</font>

248
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you, broadaxe?!</font>

249
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't call a man by his weapon's name!</font>

250
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in asking me questions.</font>

251
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have nothing to tell any of you!</font>

252
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the man with the toughest guard in the whole world!</font>

253
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course, my mouth is well-guarded too!</font>

254
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you at least tell us your name?!</font>

255
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have no obligations to answer that!</font>

256
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't I just tell you? I'm the world's most tight-lipped man, Sentoumaru!</font>

257
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? Sentoumaru, is it?</font>

258
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just felt like telling you that!</font>

259
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wasn't answering your question!</font>

260
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go, PX-1!</font>

261
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's firing beams from his palms too...</font>

262
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't have pads.</font>

263
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't want to think about it, but that makes him the third!</font>

264
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

265
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rather than wondering about that,
it'd be safer for us to run away right now!</font>

266
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we get into another fight now, someone will definitely die!</font>

267
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run before we meet the admiral...!</font>

268
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah...</font>

269
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's run away from here!</font>

270
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't stay together... We'll split up and escape!</font>

271
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think we should run, too!</font>

272
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The three of us should split up!</font>

273
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure... Are you gonna be alright?</font>

274
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

275
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll protect Nami-swan!</font>

276
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if it costs me my life!</font>

277
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, thank you. Let's get going!</font>

278
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're ready to risk your life, then you should be the decoy for all of us!</font>

279
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ladies only, damn bastard!</font>

280
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just take care of yourself, panty-man!</font>

281
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-kun will protect me as well as he can, so don't worry!</font>

282
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute, Usopp! I'm hurt...</font>

283
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not worry! I shall cover for you!</font>

284
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your injuries still haven't healed, right?</font>

285
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To tell you the truth, I saw your act of self-sacrifice back on Thriller Bark!</font>

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see...</font>

287
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks!</font>

288
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're running over there!</font>

289
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right.</font>

290
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those beams are scary!</font>

291
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone, we'll meet up at the Sunny in three days!</font>

292
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're splitting up and running!</font>

293
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chase them, PX-1!</font>

294
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them get out of Grove 12, or we'll be in trouble.</font>

295
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure Kill Super Smoke Star!</font>

296
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now's our chance!</font>

297
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are quite reliable!</font>

298
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn! The bridge!</font>

299
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he is!</font>

300
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did he come here?!</font>

301
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey... You...! Hey!</font>

302
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't push me!</font>

303
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went that way? Are they alright?!</font>

304
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have time to worry about others!</font>

305
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have anything against pirates though.</font>

306
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rubber</font>

307
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gatling!</font>

308
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

309
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did he just do?!</font>

310
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've got some pretty good offensive power, but...</font>

311
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My guard is the strongest in the world!</font>

312
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leg Locked, Heave-Ho!</font>

313
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

314
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! He's this strong, too?!</font>

315
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just thought I'd tell you, I'm not a devil fruit-user!</font>

316
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something strange about his techniques...!</font>

317
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?! Who are you?!</font>

318
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... Get away!</font>

319
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from Zoro, you freak!</font>

320
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Z-Z-Zoro-san!</font>

321
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-san was hit by a beam!</font>

322
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Zoro, pull yourself together!</font>

323
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, he's late!</font>

324
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you finally arrived, old man Kizaru?!</font>

325
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kizaru?!</font>

326
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful! That man is a navy admiral!</font>

327
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Admiral?!</font>

328
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're a bit too late...</font>

329
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">120 million bounty-head, "Pirate Hunter" Zoro...</font>

330
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd heard that you were a reasonably accomplished swordsman...</font>

331
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But seeing how you were beaten with one shot, I suppose you're pretty exhausted, huh?</font>

332
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn...</font>

333
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's an admiral...?</font>

334
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take yourself a long rest...</font>

335
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!!!</font>

336
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, he can fire beams too!</font>

337
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad! We've gotta do something!</font>

338
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he's hit at such a close range, he'll die!</font>

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! Zoro's in trouble!</font>

340
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

341
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... Stop it!</font>

342
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! Why?!</font>

343
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't hit him!</font>

344
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't stab him either! What do we do?!</font>

345
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

346
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You...</font>

347
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move your leg!</font>

348
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please move!</font>

349
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's no use.</font>

350
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ate the Light Fruit, I'm a light man.</font>

351
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a Logia.</font>

352
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Light man?!</font>

353
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're kidding, right?! He's gonna die!</font>

354
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro! Run!</font>

355
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

356
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body... won't...</font>

357
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use! That guy is at his limit already!</font>

358
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Veinte Fleur!</font>

359
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Twenty Flower</i></font>

360
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Great, Robin!</font>

361
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you get away.</font>

362
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's useless.</font>

363
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll die now.</font>

364
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, now you decide to appear...</font>

365
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Dark King", Rayleigh?</font>

366
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you take out these youngsters.</font>

367
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their era is only beginning!</font>

368
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pops!</font>
