<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tora-guy, have you been to that island?</font>

131
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dress-<i>roba</i>!</font>

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Roba: Old Lady</i></font>

133
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's "rosa"!</font>

134
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never been there.</font>

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's that bastard's kingdom.</font>

136
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, let's figure everything out once we get there!</font>

137
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gonna be an adventure!</font>

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't wait to see Dressrosa!</font>

139
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go to the Wano Country soon, too!</font>

140
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous!</font>

141
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't just show up without a plan...</font>

142
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji, I'm hungry!</font>

143
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's for breakfast?</font>

144
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sandwiches.</font>

145
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! I want a cotton-candy sandwich!</font>

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll just have a cup of tea.</font>

147
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't like bread!</font>

148
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't tell you why we were being chased.</font>

149
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we set sail for the  place called Zou originally.</font>

150
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zou?</font>

151
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know it?</font>

152
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's another coincidence.</font>

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After handing over Caesar
and destroying the SMILE factory,</font>

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was gonna head for Zou.</font>

155
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My crew is there.</font>

156
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-If so, can we go along with you there?</font>

157
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, you can! Let's go there
and then the Wano Country!</font>

158
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

159
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">3 Samurai including me and Momonosuke...</font>

160
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">4 of us headed for Zou.</font>

161
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but our ship wrecked...</font>

162
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and two of us Samurai and Momonosuke drifted to Dressrosa.</font>

163
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But we had been chased by
Doflamingo and the others there</font>

164
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I ran into an unknown ship.</font>

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There, I met the children
who were looking to get treated.</font>

166
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And unfortunately, the ship left the port</font>

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">before I knew it and headed for that island.</font>

168
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>--Father!
--Oh no! Momonosuke!</i></font>

169
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was gonna go after the ship...</font>

170
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and my fellow samurai Kanjuro tried to cover me but got caught!</font>

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Go after Momonosuke! Don't worry about me!</i></font>

172
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He let me sail out to the sea!</font>

173
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to save him!</font>

174
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to go back!</font>

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a man, that Kanjuro!</font>

176
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kanjuro!</font>

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! I'm gonna go save him with you!</font>

178
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys! Don't forget our purpose!</font>

179

<font face="impress bt" size="45">New World</font>

180
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,010

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the carte blanche for robbery by the World Government</font>

185
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in exchange for their overwhelming strength and notorious prestige!</font>

186
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Them taking sides with the Government has to be...</font>

187
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">seen as a threat to all 
other pirates in the world.</font>

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The greatest swordsman in the world...</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hawk-Eyes, Dracule Mihawk.</font>

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The king of Dressrosa and a charismatic devil...</font>

191
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Heavenly Demon, Donquixote Doflamingo.</font>

192
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is now the Navy's human weapon!</font>

193
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Tyrant, Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The empress of Amazon Lily...</font>

195
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock.</font>

196
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Worst Generation

200
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And with the man I told you about earlier, they make up for the Seven Warlords.</font>

201
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that all changed early this morning.</font>

202
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo resigned out of the blue.</font>

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we might need to expel Law from the Warlords depending on his intention.</font>

204
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The third great power, that stands alongside Navy HQ and the Four Emperors, cannot remain this unstable.</font>

207
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not gonna let Law and
Straw Hat do whatever they want!</font>

208
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got an annoying call from
Smoker of the G-5 yesterday.</font>

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see how things go for today.</font>

210
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've sent Fujitora!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol-<i>sama</i>, where are you?!</font>

216
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you seen Trébol-<i>sama</i>?</font>

217
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

218
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder what Young 
Master-<i>sama</i> is going to do?!</font>

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the Navy is gonna come to attack, I want to fight-<i>in</i>!</font>

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will just follow the Young Master.</font>

221
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,610

222
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing up there?!</font>

223
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look! The whole kingdom is going crazy!</font>

224
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure the whole world is getting upset!</font>

225
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey!</font>

226
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, did you get 
your fiancé killed again?</font>

227
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too close!</font>

228
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you keep asking me that?
You're so annoying!</font>

229
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Annoying but?</font>

230
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">--Too close!</font>

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Annoying but what? Hmmm?</font>

232
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Annoying but you like me, maybe?</font>

233
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough!
Young Master-<i>sama</i> was calling you!</font>

234
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted you to bring <i>that thing</i>!</font>

235

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

237
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just keep getting your fiancé killed! Baby 5!</font>

238
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop choosing guys that will 
be killed by Doffy and marry me!</font>

239
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm, just kidding!</font>

240
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you...</font>

241
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...need me?</font>

242
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cut it out!</font>

243
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Colosseum is always packed.</font>

244
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks to you, Diamante.</font>

245
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying?</font>

246
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doffy, that's because
you're a charismatic king.</font>

247
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

248
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's because you're strong.</font>

249
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop. You make it sound like
I'm the hero of the Colosseum.</font>

250
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You <i>are</i> the hero of the Colosseum.</font>

251
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop saying that.</font>

252
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, I'll stop.</font>

253
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I admit it if you insist!</font>

254
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I am the hero of the Colosseum!</font>

255
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I brought it!</font>

256
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doffy, it's <i>that thing</i>!</font>

257
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too close!</font>

258
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too close, but...?</font>

259
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I like it. Sit down.</font>

260
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Straw Hat Luffy finds out about this,</font>

261
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure he will try to get hold of it.</font>

262

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh? Have we met before?</font>

395
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your faces look familiar.</font>

396
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yeah!
You were in the paper this morning...</font>

397
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch!</font>

398
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! The strings got tangled up! Help me!</font>

399
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?! A toy?!</font>

400
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Everywhere you look,</i></font>

401
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>blending in with the town...</i></font>

402
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and living side-by-side with humans.</i></font>

403
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They are living toys.</i></font>

404
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}<i>This is a kingdom of love 
and passion and toys.</i></font>

405
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The port town - Acacia.</i></font>

406
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man has been stabbed!</font>

407
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, again?</font>

408
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean "Again"?</font>

409
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there a phantom slasher or something?</font>

410
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No. Women in this country are passionate about love and most are the jealous type.</font>

411
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So when a man cheats on a woman,</font>

412
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">things can get pretty violent.</font>

413
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How scary!</font>

414
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The more beautiful they are, the more likely to stab a man!</font>

415
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Toys are moving by themselves but that's okay!</font>

416
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's eat!</font>

417
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have time to fool around like this!</font>

418
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need to look for Kanjuro 
as soon as possible!</font>

419
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa-whoa, relax.</font>

420
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:29,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know we need to hurry but it's better to get some information rather than just run everywhere.</font>

421
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it strange?</font>

422
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Their king just abdicated from the throne this morning.</font>

423
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought there would be more confusion.</font>

424
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe they don't know yet.</font>

425
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

426
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's ask. Hey, pops!</font>

427
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't!</font>

428
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's your problem?!</font>

429
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were on the front page of 
the newspaper this morning!</font>

430
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here's your order.</font>

431
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for waiting...</font>

432
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...or not!</font>

433
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!
I couldn't wait any longer!</font>

434
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dress Shrimp Paella!</font>

435
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rose Squid Ink Pasta!</font>

436
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Fairy Pumpkin Gazpacho!</font>

437
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything looks yummy!</font>

438
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's eat!</font>

439
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yum-yum!</font>

440
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's "Fairy Pumpkin"?</font>

441
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Um, that's... In this country,
we still believe in a myth about fairies!</font>

442
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or not!</font>

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, people claim to see fairies! Or not!</font>

444
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing fairies?</font>

445
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Isn't it interesting?</font>

446
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For centuries!</font>

447
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though most of us haven't 
seen them, they do exist.</font>

448
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People call those fairies...</font>

449
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">..."guardian deities of Dressrosa"!</font>

450
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or not!</font>

451
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, shut up!</font>

452
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got it right again! Fourteen times in a row!</font>

453
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?
It's a little noisy back there.</font>

454
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a roulette game.</font>

455
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, white!</font>

456
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see.</font>

457
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How does it go? What is it?</font>

458
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've missed it again. It's black 20!</font>

459
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It should be white this time!</font>

460
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's black again!</font>

461
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's awful!</font>

462
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're a disgrace to Donquixote!</font>

463
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I'm running out 
of luck. This is no good.</font>

464
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you wanna do? Do you wanna quit?</font>

465
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can make a lot of money
when Buffalo-<i>san</i> isn't here.</font>

466
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

467
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One last time.</font>

468
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet everything!</font>

469
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Great!</font>

470
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'm gonna bet everything
on whichever color you don't pick.</font>

471
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's play it like real men!</font>

472
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything? Really?</font>

473
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

474
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, let's do it.</font>

475
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Place your bets!</font>

476
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">White, please!</font>

477
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you pick white, I bet on black, of course!</font>

478
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on, white! White!</font>

479
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which is it?</font>

480
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, old man!</font>

481
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">--It's bl...
--White!</font>

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah?! Who the hell are you?!</font>

483
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look carefully! It's black, idiot!</font>

484
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's white.</font>

485
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Old man, you win!</font>

486
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

487
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard! Stay out of it!</font>

488
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

489
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you wanna get your ass kicked?!</font>

490
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is he?</font>

491
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">
Doesn't he have any idea who they are?!</font>

492
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got himself involved, as usual!</font>

493
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Do I really win?!</font>

494
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, you win.</font>

495
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know who you are
but thank you for your kindness!</font>

496
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mention it. I just said what I saw.</font>

497
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm happy for you.</font>

498
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, old man, you look so strong...</font>

499
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you're doing is so senseless, you brat!</font>

500
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When we say "It's black," it's black!</font>

501
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can't see anyway so it doesn't matter!</font>

502
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so annoying!</font>

503
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go away!</font>

504
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young man, could you step aside a little bit?</font>

505
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to send those people to hell.</font>

506
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's heavy! So heavy...</font>

507
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm going to get crushed!</font>

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! What's wrong with him?!</font>

509
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did he do?!</font>

510
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! It left a hole!</font>

511
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not too bad being blind.</font>

512
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:43,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know there are many hideous things
that are better unseen.</font>
