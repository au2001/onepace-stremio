133
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought we told you.
The mountain is our playground.</font>

134
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible to catch me.</font>

135
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

136
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He doesn't give up.  But he can't match my reach.</font>

137
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's like a monkey.</font>

138
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

139
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit.  The mountain's huge,
so if he gets away then it'll be impossible to find him.</font>

140
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Him?</font>

141
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if it isn't Trafalgar Law, the freeloader.</font>

142
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a good thing I ran into you.  Right now, Straw Hat Luffy is...</font>

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell do you think you're doing?</font>

144
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

145
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait... Hey, you!  Gimme my body back!</font>

146
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

147
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

148
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's Traf!  So you saved Nami?</font>

149
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been thinking.</font>

150
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something
I'd like to discuss with you, Straw-Hatter.</font>

151
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It may have been just a coincidence that you came to this island,</font>

152
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but there's actually a <i>key</i> </font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc">hidden here.  One with
the power to throw the entire New World into chaos.</font>

153
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are two ways to survive in the New World.</font>

154
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Either be protected by one of the Four Emperors,</font>

155
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or fight all of them.</font>

156
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not the kind of guy
who'll serve under someone else, are you?</font>

157
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  I prefer being the captain!</font>

158
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, form an alliance with me.</font>

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An alliance?</font>

160
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you and I work together, we might be able to do it.</font>

161
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've got a plan to dethrone one of the Four Emperors.</font>

162
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An alliance?</font>

163
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you suggesting that if we work together
we could defeat one of the Four Emperors?</font>

164
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's ridiculous!  I don't know what you're after, but...</font>

165
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, don't fall for his fast talk.</font>

166
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't say we'd be able to do it now.</font>

167
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if we play our cards right
we should eventually be able to create an opportunity.</font>

168
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you say, Straw-Hatter?</font>

169
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one of the Four Emperors are you talking about?</font>

170
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on, Luffy!  Why are you listening to him?</font>

171
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't trust someone like him!</font>

172
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

173
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!  We're in!</font>

174
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

175
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,430
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Straw Hat Pirates' Temporary Shelter{lit. evacuation point--not temporary}</b></font>

176
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaat?!</i></font>

177
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We're forming an alliance with the Heart Pirates?!</i></font>

178
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You just went to get Nami back,
so how did it come to such a crazy deal?!</font>

179
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said-</font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc"></font>

180
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't be able to sleep at night if we form an alliance with such an enigmatic, unpredictable bastard!</font>

181
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on Luffy, everybody's against it.</font>

182
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have to do it.
There's no reason to do something this dangerous.</font>

183
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should continue our voyage at our own pace.</font>

184
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, Luffy!
It's far too soon to try to take on the Four Emperors!</font>

185
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way we could fight them.</font>

186
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what about this raccoon dog?</font>

187
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not a raccoon dog anymore!</font>

188
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaa?!</font>

189
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

190
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Super...</font>

191
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to me?!</font>

192
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy...</font>

193
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll follow your decision, but...</font>

194
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">pirate alliances and betrayal go hand in hand.</font>

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They might not be suited
for someone as overly trusting as you.</font>

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you gonna betray me?</font>

197
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nope.</font>

198
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Try to be a little skeptical!</font>

199
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway,
I think a pirate alliance sounds like a lot of fun!</font>

200
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think Traf's a good guy...</font>

201
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but even if he isn't, there's no need to worry!</font>

202
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys have trained a lot in the past two years
and can back me up.</font>

203
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaaa?!</font>

204
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, you...</font>

205
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, cut it out!  It's embarrassing.</font>

206
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you can super-rely on us.</font>

207
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We do manage to help out every now and then...</font>

208
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it's not like we're happy, you jerk!</font>

209
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Alright then, Luffy!  You can rely on us!</font>

210
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Zoro and the others chicken out,
I will convince them!</font>

211
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm back!  Back in my perfect body!</font>

212
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep, being me is best for me!</font>

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super!</font>

214
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's great, Franky.</font>

215
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hope you never wind up back in Chopper's body,</font>

216
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">ever again.</font>

217
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm also...</font>

218
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">back to normal.</font>

219
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But how could you leave my body all broken?!</font>

220
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell were you thinking,
treating other people's bodies like this?!</font>

221
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, sorry.</font>

222
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all his fault.</font>

223
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!
You were the one rampaging in Chopper's body!</font>

224
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My only choice was to stop you!</font>

225
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But still, you didn't have to use an attack powerful enough to take out the kraken!</font>

226
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're both just as bad!</font>

227
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, sorry.</font>

228
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it enough just to be in your own body, Chopper?</font>

229
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why am I the only one who has to bear this pain?!</font>

230
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First Franky's body and now Sanji-kun.</font>

231
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't laugh at others' expense!  I can't believe you!</font>

232
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing we can do.</font>

233
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have Chopper and Franky's bodies,
so their souls can return to the right places...</font>

234
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but Sanji took your body to search for the samurai.</font>

235
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your soul was left over,
so it had to go into Sanji's body.</font>

236
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't you do anything?  Come on!</font>

237
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible without a body.</font>

238
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So these are the children?</font>

239
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I wanna save these kids.</font>

240
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're more trouble than they're worth.  Leave 'em.</font>

241
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently they're all addicted to drugs.</font>

242
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know that!  I examined them!</font>

243
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I want to take them back to their homes, but it'll take time to get the drug out of their system.</font>

244
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And they've been turned into giants too.</font>

245
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a terrible experiment they performed on them</font>

246
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've been researching
how to turn humans into giants for centuries.</font>

247
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The project was run by the World Government.</font>

248
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Government?  Why would they do such a thing?</font>

249
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Most likely to make soldiers.</font>

250
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody could stand against the Government
if they turned all of their soldiers into giants.</font>

251
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Caesar successfully perfects the process
then he would trump the Government and Vegapunk...</font>

252
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but of course it isn't an easy thing to do.</font>

253
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really want to save them?</font>

254
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're just some random kids from here and there.</font>

255
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.  Maybe we've never met
or even seen these kids before...</font>

256
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the kids cried and begged that we save them.</font>

257
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master may have done a good job
of tricking them to bring them here,</font>

258
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but some of the older children are already realizing that this facility isn't exactly what it seems.</font>

259
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until I make sure that these kids are safe,
I will never leave this island!</font>

260
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, are you planning to stay here by yourself?</font>

261
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't leave anybody behind.</font>

262
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami and Chopper want to do it,
so I'll help them.</font>

263
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and Sanji went to put the samurai back together.</font>

264
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're going to be allied with us
then you gotta help us out.</font>

265
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jeez, I knew you had no idea what was going on.</font>

266
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The "alliance" he asked you to form...</font>

267
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">only means that we're working together for the
sole purpose of achieving a certain objective, right?</font>

268
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally.</font>

269
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what you meant, but when Luffy
hears the word "alliance" he thinks of something else.</font>

270
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like friends, right?</font>

271
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you thought you could get him to follow some plan,
that isn't gonna happen.</font>

272
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yep, that's right.</font>

273
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once he gets some wild idea, he won't budge.
That's the problem with Luffy.  It's always like this.</font>

274
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In terms of self-centered stubbornness, Luffy's on par with the Four Emperors.</font>

275
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow, that sounds terrible.</font>

276
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what your crew member is currently trying to do
has absolutely nothing to do with our-</font><font face="Eigerdals Bold" size="56" color="#fcfadc"></font>

277
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Don't flick boogers on me, you asshole!</font>

278
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my bad!</font>

279
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't even dodge when I'm like this!</font>

280
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My bad.</font>

281
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, all right.  We don't have time to argue.</font>

282
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can take care of the samurai yourselves.</font>

283
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll investigate the drug
that was administered to the children.</font>

284
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which one of you is the doctor?</font>

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come with me.  We'll have to distract Caesar.</font>

286
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, this should do it.</font>

287
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry.  I can't move right now so I'll have to rely on you.</font>

288
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't drop him, Traf!</font>

289
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry... can't stop... laughing!</font>

290
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Super-cute!</font>

291
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're counting on you, Chopper.</font>

292
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it to me.</font>

293
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It should be clear
from the actions of the two assassins...</font>

294
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesaro plans to kill both you and White Hunter's G-5,
and then take the kids back.</font>

295
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll keep coming until he gets what he wants.</font>

296
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Four years ago, as a former Government scientist, he was judged a criminal after the accident.</font>

297
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If word gets out that there are people on this island, which is supposed to be off-limits to everyone,</font>

298
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then he'll lose this perfect hideout.</font>

299
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why he'll do everything he can to kill you.</font>

300
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He has a bounty of 300 million beli.</font>

301
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He possesses weapons of mass destruction as well as
the powers of the Gas Gas Fruit, a logia-type.</font>

302
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Caesar Clown we're dealing with.</font>

303
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">300 million...</font>

304
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People who can't wield haki
should definitely stay away from him.</font>

305
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't your average scientist.</font>

306
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our haki-users are me, Zoro, and Sanji.</font>

307
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you, I presume?</font>

308
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That should be enough.</font>

309
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll head to the laboratory first.</font>

310
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then when we get there,
we'll all kidnap Master together.</font>

311
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

312
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... what do you mean by kidnap?</font>

313
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For ransom?  But wouldn't Master have the money?</font>

314
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you kidnap him, who's going to pay us?</font>

315
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The objective isn't money.  It's confusion.</font>

316
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Confusion?</font>

317
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

318
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in talking about it, until we succeed.</font>

319
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyways, focus on capturing Caesar Clown.</font>

320
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It won't be easy.</font>

321
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When the time comes,
I'll lay out the entire plan to everyone.</font>

322
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But once we succeed in capturing Caesar,</font>

323
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the situation's naturally going to be chaotic.</font>

324
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When that happens, there's no turning back.</font>

325
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess this is our last chance to change our minds.</font>

326
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine.  I'll work with you.</font>

327
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, I also accept your wishes.</font>

328
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure to convince the rest of your crew as well.</font>

329
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, got it.</font>

330
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,110
<font face="Roboto" size="39"><b>Caesar Clown's Laboratory - Main Entrance</b></font>

331
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this!  You damn monster!</font>

332
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iron-joint Smoodge!</font>

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fein Bock the Gourd!</font>

334
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chappe the Rope-puller!</font>

335
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smoker-san!</font>

336
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no doubt, these are all former prisoners.</font>

337
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though their bodies have been changed.</font>

338
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?!</font>

339
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The accident report from four years ago said that none of the prisoners survived.  Was that a lie?</font>

340
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smo-san, who are these guys?!</font>

341
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell if I know!</font>

342
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just focus on drawing the enemy inland for now!</font>

343
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We <i>will</i> get on board that ship,
and set sail to make our report!</font>

344
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master, the Snail Phone's ringing.</font>

345
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No need to answer it.</font>

346
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're going to say, "We opened the door."</font>

347
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then, "Something came out of it."</font>

348
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Some of our men died.  Save us."</font>

349
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then screams.</font>

350
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's hard on the ears.</font>

351
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have more than enough people like that.</font>

352
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can always capture more test subjects.</font>

353
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you hear me?!  Master!  Can you hear me?!</font>

354
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please come in!</font>

355
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Burning Lands!
We opened the door, just like you said!</font>

356
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!  Master isn't answering!</font>

357
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's coming!</font>

358
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is that thing
that came out of the warehouse?</font>

359
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already lost too many men.  Just run!</font>

360
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's as big as a mountain!  What the hell is that blob?!</font>

361
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's right behind us!  Save us!</font>

362
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

363
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me introduce my pet.</font>

364
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's an extremely rare life-form, a slime.</font>

365
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ma...ster...</font>

366
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one will make it off this island alive!</font>

367
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How's it feel to be free after so long?</font>

368
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smiley!</font>
