92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the name of your future husband.</font>

93
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be sure to remember it!</font>

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,360

95

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keeping my body in shape everyday isn't something I do just to have some perverted beast spy on it!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're getting outta this forest!</font>

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't just anyone, you can tell by looking at him!</font>

104
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... is this shock running through my body...?</font>

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's as if I had just been struck by a bolt of lightning!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! This isn't time to stand without doing anything!</font>

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is our job to capture those three!</font>

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right!</font>

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we fail, Perona-sama's punishment awaits us!</font>

113
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! They're going after that lady!</font>

114
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, why am I protecting that girl?!</font>

115
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moreover, I can't move...!</font>

116
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This body is too weak!</font>

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up and catch those three!</font>

118
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Wild Zombies!</font>

119
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lay a hand on that woman!</font>

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, Perv-salom!</font>

121
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We receive orders from the master, but we're Perona-sama's subordinates!</font>

122
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I said wait!</font>

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm aware that you are Perona's underlings.</font>

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...!</font>

125
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should still know not to make me angry.</font>

126
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't push your luck.</font>

127
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want?!</font>

128
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't let you... go after that lady.</font>

129
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, newcomer, stop!</font>

130
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't anger Absalom!</font>

131
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Burglar Cat!</font>

132
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Nami! She seems to be only after you!</font>

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right! What did I do?!</font>

134
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't we split into two groups and escape?</font>

135
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wanna leave me, cold-hearted monster?!</font>

136
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come here, damn it!</font>

137
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wild boar is so scary!</font>

138
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be that they...</font>

139
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What're you bastards doing?!</i></font>

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Let me out!</i></font>

141
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">just like Straw Hat now, were drawn into the other side of the wall?</font>

142
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey! Monkey!</font>

143
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And soon you'll share the same fate!</font>

144
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have invulnerable zombies coming from both sides.</font>

145
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give it up!</font>

146
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't figure out whether you're a dumbass spider or a dumbass monkey, but...</font>

147
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That huge spiderweb that the Sunny got caught in when we landed was your doing, wasn't it?</font>

148
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

149
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:44,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of your actions head right to Perona-sama's Ghost Network.</font>

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if those big ears also contribute to the info gathering.</font>

151
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They look like they could hear very well.</font>

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you say just now?</font>

153
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop pretending!</font>

154
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the worst case scenario.</font>

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're completely surrounded.</font>

156
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems we urgently need a counter-measure.</font>

157
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall I take care of this?!</font>

158
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do as you wish.</font>

159
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll try to deal with it.</font>

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm pretty reliable actually.</font>

161
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, let's get started!</font>

162
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! What're you gonna do?!</font>

163
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Coup de...</font>

164
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vent!</font>

165
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wh...aaat?!</font>

166
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You... destroyed the bridge?!</font>

167
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's how it is.</font>

168
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As violent as always.</font>

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cien Fleur...</font>

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>One Hundred Flowers</i></font>

171
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wing!</font>

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You! You can fly?!</font>

173
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, for about five seconds.</font>

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too short!</font>

175
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... but it's long enough.</font>

176
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strong Right!</font>

177
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Got it!</font>

178
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now if we can just make it to that entrance, we can follow Straw Hat!</font>

179
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry.</font>

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my limit.</font>

181
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pulling arm!</font>

182
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone seems to have fallen into the courtyard.</font>

183
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This doesn't mean it's over, but...</font>

184
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They won't follow us for now.</font>

185
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That went fairly well.</font>

186
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

187
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you use me as a stepping stone?!</font>

188
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you!</font>

189
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is unforgivable!</font>

190
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a spider!</font>

191
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get back there in no time!</font>

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is... that?</font>

193
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the...?</font>

194
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is something... falling?</font>

195
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

196
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone is coming!</font>

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Only bones!</font>

198
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bone!</font>

199
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, stop! Stop it!</font>

200
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't kill her! She's our friend!</font>

201
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard!</font>

202
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, stop!</font>

203
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and escape, Nami!</font>

204
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom is gonna be my groom!</font>

205
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Begone!</font>

206
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepare to die!</font>

207
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wa-!</font>

208
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-!</font>

210
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm...!</font>

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm actually a man!</font>

212
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey.</font>

213
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that true?!</font>

214
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

215
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a hobby of mine!</font>

216
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no joke!</font>

217
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plus...</font>

218
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You and that beast man are perfect for each other!</font>

219
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought I could give you all my support!</font>

220
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

221
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really!</font>

222
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no joke!</font>

223
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one has ever given me such supportive thoughts before.</font>

224
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:21,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the first person to ever have said such kind words to me.</font>

225
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

226
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...!</font>

227
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Raise your head, my friend.</font>

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is called friendship.</font>

229
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Namizou.</font>

230
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may call me Nami.</font>

231
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Friendship...!</font>

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!</font>

233
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She fell for it!</font>

234
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course you can't put his seal on while he's conscious.</font>

235
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do it while he's sleeping-</font>

236
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Attack while he's sleeping?!</font>

237
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that ok!? As a human being?!</font>

238
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, aren't you a zombie, Lola?</font>

239
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's mean! It's too low!</font>

240
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright as long as he's sleeping and doesn't notice.</font>

241
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Namizou.</font>

242
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can we get out of here now?</font>

243
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Lola...</font>

244
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I dropped something earlier in the treasure storehouse...</font>

245
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want it back but, I can't remember the way. Can you tell me?</font>

246
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silly you.</font>

247
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's fine.</font>

248
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The closest way is right through Lady Perona's room over there.</font>

249
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you see it?</font>

250
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's completely taken in... she's not gonna come out of it.</font>

251
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">See that incredibly high tower over there?</font>

252
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">If you go straight that way you will come across the stairs that lead to it.</font>

253
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So Nami was a man all along...</font>

254
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I always thought she acted kinda manly.</font>

255
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Nami, that guy has caught up to us.</font>

256
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

257
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola! Attack chance!</font>

258
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never meet him again, so you'll be fine!</font>

259
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do your best! You two will be the best couple!</font>

260
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, Nami!</font>

261
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm full of courage now!</font>

262
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom!</font>

263
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lola!</font>

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two, this is our chance!</font>

265
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The wild boar didn't harm Nami after all.</font>

266
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, you're incredible!</font>

267
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you talk to her, you'll realize she's not so bad after all.</font>

268
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have a weird look again!</font>

269
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not a single treasure chest in the whole ship?!</font>

270
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, there are some, but they're almost empty.</font>

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All that's left is just a small amount of money.</font>

272
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm surprised that these two ships gave us almost no spoils.</font>

273
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this really the ship of the man who beat Crocodile?</font>

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's fine.</font>

275
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Carry out some rations, if there are any.</font>

276
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

277
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona-sama!</font>

278
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hildon.</font>

279
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moria-sama has summoned the Three Mystery Persons.</font>

280
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master?</font>

281
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What for?</font>

282
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems Straw Hat Luffy has been captured.</font>

283
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time to awaken Number 900.</font>

284
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Number 900?!</font>

285
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?!</font>

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ab-sama!</font>

287
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom, you bastard! Come out and marry me!</font>

288
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You disappeared and ran again, didn't you?!</font>

289
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strange...</font>

290
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nowhere else they could have run to.</font>

291
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Kumashi!</font>

292
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama, I've got a problem...</font>

293
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's bothering me...</font>

294
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, my issues come first.</font>

295
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have three pirates come through here?</font>

296
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...</font>

297
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom!</font>

298
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing here?</font>

299
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my room.</font>

300
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona.</font>

301
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back, Perona-sama...</font>

302
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't talk, Kumashi!</font>

303
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times do I have to tell you?!</font>

304
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, there's something impo-</font>

305
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be quiet!</font>

306
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't speak.</font>

307
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are as severe as ever with Kumashi...</font>

308
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sevearsy.</font>

309
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quiet, he's my subordinate.</font>

310
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, have you heard?</font>

311
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master is calling for us.</font>

312
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did something happen?</font>

313
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did something happen? I'll tell you what happened!</font>

314
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Number 900 is gonna be awakened.</font>

315
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The 900?!</font>

316
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he capture that 300 million man?!</font>

317
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somehow, we're still barely hiding from them.</font>

318
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Did he capture that 300 million man?!</font>

319
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a miracle.</font>

320
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then again, why're we hiding in such place?!</font>

321
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We had no choice!</font>

322
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think that beast man would catch up with us so fast!</font>

323
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moreover, I don't think that guy's a zombie.</font>

324
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll get outta here once we get the chance, alright?</font>

325
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom-sama!</font>

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were here.</font>

327
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've brought interesting information.</font>

328
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

329
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's another trespasser along with the pirates.</font>

330
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trespasser?</font>

331
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The "Humming" Chivalrous Swordsman.</font>

332
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

333
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone... fell from the sky.</font>

334
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what was it that fell just now?</font>

335
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...</font>

336
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well...</font>

337
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can tell by looking at the mark...</font>

338
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a strange interruption, but you're not gonna get away from me.</font>

339
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can make as many footholds as I need.</font>

340
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey! Monkey!</font>

341
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, buy me some time.</font>

342
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you gonna do?</font>

343
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are some fine stone pillars you have here.</font>

344
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna make a little weapon.</font>

345
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spider...</font>

346
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sticky Net!</font>

347
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From the glands in his hands...</font>

348
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seis Fleur...</font>

349
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Six Flowers</i></font>

350
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slap!</font>

351
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something touched my eye!</font>

352
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm stuck!</font>

353
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got myself with the sticky net!</font>

354
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, Nico Robin, I'm ready.</font>

355
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step back.</font>

356
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?</font>

357
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, I just took the iron nunchucks I was carrying and jammed them in these pillars.</font>

358
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With a monster this huge, you need an equally huge weapon.</font>

359
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heavy Nunchaku!</font>

360
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with his power...</font>

361
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he... actually human?</font>

362
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, bastard!</font>

363
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spider Sticky Net!</font>

364
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons...</font>

365
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Left!</font>

366
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nico Robin!</font>

367
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're those things?!</font>

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mouse! Mouse!</font>

369
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry...</font>

370
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I let my guard down.</font>

371
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hadn't thought there were other spiders.</font>

372
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">D-Damn it!</font>

373
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiots...</font>

374
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monkey, Monkey...</font>

375
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not about whether you let your guard down or not.</font>

376
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These are my subordinates, the Spider Mice.</font>

377
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are as many as 500 of them here on Thriller Bark.</font>

378
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've never let even a single prey we've caught escape!</font>

379
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We wait everywhere to ambush. From the darkness and blind spots we capture our enemy.</font>

380
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our thread has been modified by Hogback-sama so that no human strength can tear it!</font>

381
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From above the ceiling while in the mansion, we carried away your friends.</font>

382
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, we'll take you to the same place as your friends.</font>

383
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Resign yourselves!</font>

Yohohohoo</font>

387
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is it?</font>

388
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's singing?!</font>

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,450
<font face="impress bt" size="43">ヨーホホーホー
Yoohoohohoo</font>

Going to deliver Bink's sake...</font>

On the other side of the tide, alarmed at the setting sun...</font>

Drawing a circle in the sky, the song of a bird.</font>

394
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, my, it seems that everyone has come to this island.</font>

395
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you get here from below?</font>

396
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I jumped. I'm very light after all.</font>

397
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you've come, then I suppose there's no choice.</font>

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you all about this island.</font>

399
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, bastard! Who're you?!</font>

400
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not a zombie!</font>

401
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're one of the pirates' friends, aren't you?!</font>

402
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, skeleton!</font>

403
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, yes.</font>

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's alright...</font>

405
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've put an end to the battle.</font>
