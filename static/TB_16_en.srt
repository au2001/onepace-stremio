<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me you wanna beat this thing?!</font>

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First there's no meat...</font>

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then they take me down to my knees.</font>

95

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's an insanely huge zombie!</font>

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no choice but to purify him!</font>

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right, Zoro!</font>

99

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And with the Sunny?!</font>

115
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was someone else, but it's just the pirate woman.</font>

116
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is your wedding with Absalom over already?</font>

117
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I'd marry that perverted, invisible beast man!</font>

118
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you escaped after all.</font>

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a useless man.</font>

120
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... what will you do?</font>

121
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true that I plan to take your ship to leave the island.</font>

122
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want to prevent that, you'll have defeat me.</font>

123
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For a weakling like you, this amount of mini hollows will be enough to tear you apart.</font>

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Tyrant, Bartholomew Kuma.</font>

137
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man who committed every brutality a pirate can.</font>

138
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! A Royal Warlord of the Sea?!</font>

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impossible!</font>

140
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man equal to Moriah-sama?!</font>

141
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why's he on Thriller Bark?!</font>

142
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way.</font>

143
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you Moriah's subordinate?</font>

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-Moriah-sama-</font>

145
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

146
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gekko Moriah has nothing to do with me anymore!</font>

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I was about to... leave this island!</font>

148
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you were to go on a trip, where would you like to go?</font>

149
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wants to chat?!</font>

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you want to hear-</font>

151
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if I went on vacation, I'd stay in a dark, damp, and evil old castle...</font>

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spending my days singing cursed songs.</font>

153
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She answered!</font>

154
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected from the Ghost Princess!</font>

155
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got carried away!</font>

156
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dare you make fun of me!</font>

157
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was overwhelmed by your reputation for a moment.</font>

158
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I have no reason to fear.</font>

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no human I can't make kneel with my ability.</font>

160
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you listening?!</font>

161
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your shadow must be really powerful, Kuma!</font>

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will defeat you and give Moriah-sama your shadow as a farewell gift!</font>

163
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Negative Ghost...</font>

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Plus...!</font>

165
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Special Hollow!</font>

166
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here it comes!</font>

167
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona-sama's ultimate combo!</font>

168
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Judging by your actions...</font>

169
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I assume you aren't going to tell me Moriah's whereabouts.</font>

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd she...?</font>

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you go, Perona-sama?!</font>

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona-sama!</font>

173
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's going on?!</font>

174
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona-sama vanished!</font>

175
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, what have you done to our princess?!</font>

176
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is unforgivable!</font>

177
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't forgive you!</font>

178
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is unforgivable!</font>

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's too scary!</font>

180
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!</font>

181
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Burglar Cat, right?</font>

182
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of Straw Hat's crewmates.</font>

183
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it true that Monkey D. Luffy...</font>

184
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">has a brother?</font>

185
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

186
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He got here in an instant!</font>

187
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did he warp?</font>

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is!</font>

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean Ace, right?</font>

190
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about him?!</font>

191
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see. So it was true.</font>

192
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

193
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you come for Luffy?</font>

194
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you after?!</font>

195
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you really a Warlord?!</font>

196
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever I do... is my problem.</font>

197
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's dangerous.</font>

198
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he after Luffy?</font>

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must tell everyone.</font>

200
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I got you, Moriah!</font>

201
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not going anywhere, you bastard!</font>

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now fight me!</font>

203
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And give everyone's shadows back!</font>

204
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow?</font>

205
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,490
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dawn.
The Shadow Recovery Time Limit Approaches</font>

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}D-Damn it!</font>

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}He tricked me!</font>

208
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait!</font>

210
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah's shadow!</font>

211
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't leave me here!</font>

212
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where am I?!</font>

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

214
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it, this is bad!</font>

215
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I promised everyone I'd get all the shadows back.</font>

216
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm in serious trouble without mine.</font>

217
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see...</font>

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was gonna happen to me without my shadow?</font>

219
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

220
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we stay like this, we'll dissolve in the sun's light!</font>

221
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad. I gotta hurry before the night's over.</font>

222
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, come.</font>

223
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will be your opponent!</font>

224
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fine.</font>

225
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The difference in weight is clear between this black sword, Shuusui, and its predecessor Yubashiri.</font>

226
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Yubashiri: Snow Run</i></font>

227
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Zoro, watch out!</font>

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this weight...!</font>

229
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Incredible!</font>

230
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He deflected that punch!</font>

231
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three Swords Style...</font>

232
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">108 Pound Cannon!</font>

233
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's huge!</font>

234
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shuusui's strike absorbed the slashes of the other two swords to join into one!</font>

235
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... it seems there's too much pointless destruction in the blade.</font>

236
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Proof that I've yet to master it.</font>

237
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its destructive power is way bigger, but...</font>

238
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no easy sword to control, it seems.</font>

239
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've given me something good,</font>

240
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Swordmaster Ryuuma.</font>

241
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not bad.</font>

242
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Had I taken that, I'd be history.</font>

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You bastard!</font>

244
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll crush you all!</font>

245
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

246
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't attack so recklessly.</font>

247
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you manage to defeat him, only Luffy's shadow will be released.</font>

248
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't even know where your and Sanji's shadows are!</font>

249
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... if Luffy beats Moriah, we'll get all the shadows at once.</font>

250
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no point in hurting yourself fighting that huge zombie!</font>

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For now, just have faith in Luffy and keep this monster at bay!</font>

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have plenty of faith in him.</font>

253
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy also has his weakness, you know...</font>

254
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His gullibility.</font>

255
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An invisible man...</font>

256
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ghost woman...</font>

257
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ruler of shadows.</font>

258
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This island is infested with people who have such abilities.</font>

259
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't expect that they'll fight Luffy fair and square.</font>

260
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is true.</font>

261
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he fools Luffy and morning comes...</font>

263
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neither he, nor I, nor the cook...</font>

264
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">None of us three will be able to fight anymore.</font>

265
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... if we can at least make Luffy go back to normal before daybreak...</font>

266
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He might still do something!</font>

267
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't think we even have thirty minutes before daybreak.</font>

268
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog is extremely thick in this sea.</font>

269
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be restricting the reach of the morning light by now.</font>

270
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's almost morning.</font>

271
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're only alive because of this fog.</font>

272
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whether it's morning or not, I'm finally starting to feel the danger of the situation.</font>

273
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:33,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

274
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this shaking?!</font>

275
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?!</font>

276
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just like before, the ship is stuck in another weird sea current!</font>

277
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, look at the sky!</font>

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can see the predawn sky!</font>

279
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog has started to clear!</font>

280
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

281
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be... that we're already out of the Florian Triangle?!</font>

282
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Oars' fault for messing with the rudder before!</font>

283
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard and his dumb games!</font>

284
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama!</font>

285
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big trouble!</font>

286
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Thriller Bark ship has come out of this foggy sea!</font>

287
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all Oars' fault!</font>

288
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moriah-sama!</font>

289
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave it that way.</font>

290
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the big deal anyways?</font>

291
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're pirates!</font>

292
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We sail up and down the seas as we please!</font>

293
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">E-Even so...</font>

294
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly; we have a most unusual visitor today, so be silent.</font>

295
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that right?</font>

296
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Tyrant, Kuma.</font>

297
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only man among the Warlords of the Sea that is truly loyal to the government!</font>

298
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're very important to the government, but...</font>

299
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've no idea what someone as uncanny as you could be scheming.</font>

300
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you were to travel, where'd you go?</font>

301
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, stop it.</font>

302
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fully aware of your abilities.</font>

303
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you come here to pick a fight?</font>

304
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Speak your business.</font>

305
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why have you come here?</font>

306
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a certain matter to report.</font>

307
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The replacement for the Royal Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile.</font>

308
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His successor has been chosen.</font>

309
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should've said that in the first place.</font>

310
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is he and what sea is he from?</font>

311
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are countless pirates.</font>

312
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of the successor is...</font>

313
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Marshall D. Teach,</font>

314
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man commonly known as Blackbeard.</font>

315
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?</font>

316
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never heard of him.</font>

317
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a fugitive from Whitebeard's crew.</font>

318
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He caused quite an uproar around the world recently.</font>

319
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The news have yet to reach the sea of the mist.</font>

320
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He earned the title through merit.</font>

321
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, what's his former bounty?</font>

322
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zero.</font>

323
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

324
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An unassigned quantity.</font>

325
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impressive that the government acknowledged him.</font>

326
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, they must be at ease now that they've filled the gap.</font>

327
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I guess this means the world is keeping its balance, right?</font>

328
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

329
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think quite the opposite.</font>

330
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that matters not.</font>

331
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly, the government has a bigger concern right now.</font>

332
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since the events at Enies Lobby... the actions of the Straw Hat pirates are being watched very thoroughly.</font>

333
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was most likely that they'd be delayed here traveling from Water 7 to Fishman Island.</font>

334
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So... have you realized what the government's current concern is?</font>

335
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That yet another...</font>

336
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Warlord of the Sea will fall at the hands of the Straw Hat pirates.</font>

337
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what the government fears.</font>

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't mess around!</font>

339
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're worried about me?!</font>

340
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just because someone else got stripped of their title by some puny pirates...</font>

341
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they think the same will happen to me?!</font>

342
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you can't take care of them yourself, I'm willing to help you.</font>

343
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who do you think you're talking to, bastard?!</font>

344
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you actually think I'd lose to that insignificant and amateurish crew?!</font>

345
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In battle, nothing is 100% sure.</font>

346
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back at Enies Lobby, who would have imagined that Rob Lucci could be defeated?</font>

347
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's exactly my point!</font>

348
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the government so scared that they're sending two Warlords of the Sea to eliminate them?!</font>

349
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh!?</font>

350
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm only here to report.</font>

351
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did not receive such orders.</font>

352
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, just shut up and watch!</font>

353
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And also, give this message to that pack of know-nothings!</font>

354
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"The Straw Hat Pirates you're so scared of have easily been...</font>

355
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">turned into loyal soldiers of Gekko Moriah's zombie army!"</font>

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog...</font>

357
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible.</font>

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thick fog was our only ray of hope.</font>

359
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who would have plotted for the fog to clear out at a moment like this?!</font>

360
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate, we'll get burnt by the morning light straight on!</font>

361
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An unexpectedly refreshing night sky.</font>

362
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-It's Moriah...!</font>

363
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Moriah!</font>

364
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Huh?</font>

365
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nearly daybreak.</font>

366
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really have time to fool around?</font>

367
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you here?</font>

368
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to Luffy?!</font>

369
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what're you talking about, Usopp?</font>

370
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's Moriah?!</font>

371
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you blind?!</font>

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's over there!</font>

373
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His belly...!</font>

374
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's inside Oars' belly!</font>

375
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside his belly?!</font>

376
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-He is!</font>

377
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, where's Luffy?</font>

378
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was he tricked after all?</font>

379
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or maybe...</font>

380
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy won't fall that easily!</font>

381
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Found him! He's in a cockpit?</font>

382
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, there was a cockpit in my belly all along?</font>

383
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is really cool!</font>

384
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm somewhat like a robot!</font>

385
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, I will give you a chance to fight me.</font>

386
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you defeat me, you can release all the shadows!</font>

387
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can come at me all together!</font>

388
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But be aware that unless you defeat Oars, you can't reach me!</font>

389
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard!</font>

390
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's dirty!</font>

391
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't purify Oars unless we defeat Moriah.</font>

392
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, Moriah is inside Oars now.</font>

393
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got a clearer target now, it seems.</font>

394
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it!</font>

395
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp.</font>

396
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since little portions don't work, go find a large quantity of salt and bring it!</font>

397
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the only way to purify Oars.</font>

398
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll do as much as we can to weaken him!</font>

399
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I got it!</font>

400
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get it!</font>

401
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure there was a kitchen in the mansion!</font>

402
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must be a large supply of salt in there.</font>

403
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salt, huh?</font>

404
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Oars.</font>

405
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eliminate that long-nose heading for the mansion.</font>

406
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let him reach the kitchen alive.</font>

407
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Master.</font>

408
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!</font>

409
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

410
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No good.</font>

411
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that Moriah is here, he's acting like a brain for Oars.</font>

412
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp!</font>

413
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you?!</font>

414
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me!</font>

415
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's safe!</font>

416
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you'd need a large quantity of salt.</font>

417
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I brought plenty of it!</font>

418
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Brook!</font>
