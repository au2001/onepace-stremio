00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to completely unbalance the New World!?</font>

137
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Don't close the gate!</font>

138
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That fake Vergo and Black Leg bro are still in there!</font>

139
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It closed!</font>

140
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's nothing we can do! The other side of the gate will be totally filled with that lethal gas!</font>

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg!</font>

142
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bro!</font>

143
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Black Leg bro!</font>

144
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Are you alright!? You are the Navy's...</font>

145
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's...!</font>

148
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell yeah, Black Leg bro!</font>

149
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad you're alive!</font>

150
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're so grateful!</font>

151
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up, you pack of bastards! Look, I'll only listen to the lilting cheer of girls!</font>

152
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Black Leg, we're really glad that you're not hurt!</font>

153
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! I only accept care and sympathy from girls!</font>

154
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was dangerous. If that fight had kept going...</font>

155
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, what's up with that guy? Isn't he your superior officer!?</font>

156
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

157
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard isn't Vice Admiral Vergo!</font>

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's an impostor!</font>

159
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ain't that right, Captain-chan?</font>

160
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, of course! The real Vergo wouldn't do that to you guys, he's like a loyal parent to you all!</font>

161
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'd never do anything like that.</font>

162
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Impostor or not, his expression changed and then he suddenly disappeared.</font>

163
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've gotta hurry, too!</font>

164
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to save the children and get them out of here!</font>

165
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're right behind you, Captain-chan!</font>

169
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. It's clear now that Law has betrayed us.</font>

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,090
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The New World, Dressrosa</font>

171
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what I figured!</font>

172
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought of him as my brother.</font>

173

<font face="impress bt" size="45">One of the Seven Royal Warlords of the Sea

174
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I watched over him carefully as he grew up.</font>

175
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too bad.</font>

176
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand.</font>

177
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's in the SAD production room?</font>

178
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were in his shoes, the first thing I'd do is wreck the whole room.</font>

179
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then kidnap Caesar?</font>

180
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nah, I'd probably just kill him.</font>

181
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, Caesar is the only person in the world</font>

182
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">who knows how to properly prepare the SAD.</font>

183
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, if he does do this, I'll be in a lot of trouble, Vergo.</font>

184
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If Caesar is killed then there's no one else who can make the gas. That'll be bad for my business.</font>

185
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Try relaxiin', Baby 5, what're you doiin' to our poor master?</font>

186
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not gonna forgive him this time! I'm gonna kill this filthy bastard!</font>

187
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if I get into trouble? What happens after that?</font>

188
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oiin!</font>

189
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After that comes...</font>

190
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a series of unfortunate events!</font>

191
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you intend to do about our cute youngster Law-chan, young master?</font>

192
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quite clear that he's rebelling against us, don't you agree, young master?</font>

193
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be painful for you, Vergo, but please get rid of Law right now.</font>

194
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be made to regret that he was ever born into this world. Make his death truly unpleasant.</font>

195
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand.</font>

196
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll even take a photo of the corpse for you to see, Doffy.</font>

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can use the camera that I bought in Dressrosa.</font>

198
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You didn't even buy a camera in Dressrosa, did you?</font>

199
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, I didn't buy a camera at all.</font>

200
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case I'll bring you one of his ears.</font>

201
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait!</font>

202
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caesar, Monet, are you listening?</font>

203
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, Joker.</font>

204
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Joker!</font>

205
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Law is a given, but you must be wary of Straw Hat, he has awakened the Conqueror's Haki within him.</font>

206
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His abilities may be even greater than Law's.</font>

207
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have the perfect hotblooded lady hanging around here.</font>

208
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll be sending Baby 5 and Buffalo over there now.</font>

209
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When this mess is over you must all come to Dressrosa.</font>

210
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course.</font>

211
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

213
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Man, this little dragon is even more trouble than that big one. He's really nimble.</font>

214
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then what're you lying around for!?
 Stop the damn dragon!</font>

215
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Building B is already a sea of flames.</font>

216
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we let him carry on like that and one of these tanks explodes...</font>

217
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then the walls might break and that deadly gas will come flooding inside!</font>

218
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happens then there's no way that anyone will survive!</font>

219
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, everyone!</font>

220
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I cannot allow myself to back down from this dragon!</font>

221
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bear a grudge against him!</font>

222
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With my own two hands I swear—</font>

223
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, no, I'm the one who can't forgive what that dragon has done!</font>

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You all saw it, didn't you? His terrible behavior earlier!</font>

225
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He charged right in, wanting to eat me...</font>

226
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right before my very eyes he gave me such a disappointed look!</font>

227
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not exactly food though, are you?</font>

228
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even bones have nutrition, you know!</font>

229
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, sure, I'll bear that in mind.</font>

230
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kin'emon-san, please let me deal with this!</font>

231
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you saying!? You must step back now!</font>

232
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I'll do it!</font>

233
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be me!</font>

234
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will!</font>

235
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It will be me!</font>

236
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will!</font>

237
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With a one, and a two and a nin, nin, nin!</font>

238
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What ever are you doing?</font>

239
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Being a samurai!</font>

240
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a ninja!</font>

241
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here he comes!</font>

242
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,960

244
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Breast band girl, you can use ninja skills!?</font>

245
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop calling me that!</font>

246
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eat this! The foulest smelling flower in the world!</font>

248
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoa! So, even the puppy-faced goblin can use witchcraft!</font>

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who're you callin' a goblin!?</font>

250
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forty Flowers! Four Hands!</font>

251
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold!</font>

252
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the courtesan uses witchcraft!</font>

253
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's falling! I'll finish him off!</font>

254
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never! Leave him to me!</font>

255
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow after me, Corpse-dono!</font>

258
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,890

259
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,330

264
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I guess I am a corpse.</font>

265
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

266
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did it.</font>

267
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perfect victory!</font>

268
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please say "bones are tasty"!</font>

269
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn this irritating dragon!</font>

270
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, bastard!</font>

271
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had good reason, but Kin'emon-san, why're you beating him like he's your parent's worst enemy?</font>

272
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's as good as my parent's worst enemy!</font>

273
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, wait...</font>

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both of you get back on quickly or we'll leave you behind!</font>

275
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, wait for us, please!</font>

276
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute! Look at that!</font>

277
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That voice!</font>

278
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper's transformed into a monster!</font>

279
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the heck is he doing!?</font>

280
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,330
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Building B 2nd Floor - Examination Room</font>

281
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, there doesn't seem to be any problem.</font>

282
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can go back to the Biscuit Room now.</font>

283
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

284
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's candy there for you.</font>

285
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yay!</font>

286
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, I was thinkin', where'd that other kid go?</font>

287
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Other kid?</font>

288
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

289
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went to the secret room you shouldn't go to.</font>

290
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then he turned into a little dragon.</font>

291
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That boy Momonosuke did.</font>
