100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The place they took her to was the auction in Grove 1!</font>

101
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you say it was Peterman?</font>

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you find it out?</font>

103
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, let's fly!</font>

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a little too fast! I am scared!</font>

105
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She hasn't been sold already, has she?</font>

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the Head, calling all men! Get me some info on today's auction!</font>

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It started at 4 o'clock, and it's been going for 30 minutes already!</font>

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, will this really be alright?</font>

119
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No problem at all!</font>

120
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mermaid would certainly be the main event, so they'll save her for the end!</font>

121
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll make it!</font>

122
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, take the fastest route! This thing is slower than the Flying Fish!</font>

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said, calm down, Master Black Leg!</font>

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the Head of this team! Did you see me change my course after we learned the mermaid's location?</font>

125
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh, no...</font>

126
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's because...</font>

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been heading to Grove 1 from the beginning!</font>

128
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look ahead! That's Grove 1! I am the Head, so I got here before everyone else!</font>

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you serious?</font>

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This must be the intuition of a professional!</font>

131
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've arrived, Reindeer-san!</font>

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you. Huh?</font>

133
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Sanji!</font>

134
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lost, didn't you?!</font>

135
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be careful!</font>

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! Thanks a lot!</font>

137
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this guy?</font>

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">200 thousand belly! Anyone else?</font>

139
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Sold!</font>

140
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this it?</font>

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said, why can't you give her back?!</font>

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm telling you that Camie-chan is not for sale!</font>

143
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who's out of line here!</font>

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't drop it soon, I can take legal countermeasures!</font>

145
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're disturbing our business!</font>

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys...!</font>

147
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean, "business", you damn bastard?!</font>

148
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think I'll accept a business like this in this world?!</font>

149
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A lawless pirate like yourself has no right to lecture me about morality!</font>

150
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slave-trading is a worldwide taboo! How much did you pay the government?</font>

151
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What an ill-mannered accusation...</font>

152
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I suppose you're right!</font>

153
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When talking to the government or marines,</font>

154
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it seems that terms like "slave-trading" are hard for them comprehend.</font>

155
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's as if they have no idea that this business of ours exists!</font>

156
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How ridiculous... So the whole system is crooked, then?!</font>

157
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can the government tolerate this?!</font>

158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, could you please...</font>

159
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is annoying!</font>

160
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're sure the mermaid is in there, so let's just break her out!</font>

161
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weapons...</font>

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! There are Celestial Dragons inside!</font>

163
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And if Camie has been brought here, then she's probably got a neck ring already!</font>

164
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That exploding thing?!</font>

165
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, we can't just get her out?</font>

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you'd please leave then.</font>

167
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, you...!</font>

168
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, Sanji!</font>

169
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go, Chopper!</font>

170
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't, Sanji!</font>

171
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it...</font>

172
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">If the guy won't listen, then...!</font>

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Girlie! Where are you going?</font>

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">I said calm down, Sanji!</font>

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can't hurt them, then we'll just play by their rules to get Camie back!</font>

176
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,400
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Backstage</font>

177
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring out numbers 15 and 16.</font>

178
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Understood.</font>

179
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!</font>

180
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to! I'd rather stay in the cell!</font>

181
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't wanna be a slave!</font>

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me, please! Help!</font>

183
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give him a tranquilizer.</font>

184
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Call the Navy! Please!</font>

185
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't sell me, please!</font>

186
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin... Save me!</font>

187
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noooooo!</font>

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chief, I think that's the Straw Hat crew.</font>

189
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Straw Hats' captain isn't there...</font>

190
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was hoping to see just how dumb he was myself...</font>

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, things are heating up, on this Grand Human Auction!</font>

192
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our next entry is an instant purchase, for sure!</font>

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Entry number 15 is a knockout female slave!</font>

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please observe the miraculous proportions of this 20 year old dancer, Pascia!</font>

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's one of today's big draws!</font>

196
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Her marvelous dancing figure is sure to impress even the heavens!</font>

197
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got loads of treasure stored on the ship.</font>

198
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's at least 200 million in all...</font>

199
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the going price for a mermaid?</font>

200
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have that much, then it should be enough, but I can't repay that!</font>

201
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, Hachi? Are you Camie's guardian or something?</font>

202
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like that...</font>

203
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's to get our friend back, then I don't care how much we have to pay!</font>

204
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone agrees, right?</font>

205
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course! This isn't about money!</font>

206
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot... you guys...</font>

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never forget this...!</font>

208
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Nami-san I love!</font>

209
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up and come on.</font>

210
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry! Hurry!</font>

211
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I get it!</font>

212
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry to Grove 1!</font>

213
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is Grove 2, huh?</font>

214
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then it's the next one, right?</font>

215
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is everyone there yet?</font>

216
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Extra! Extra!</font>

217
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the World Government out of its mind?</font>

218
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they really do this, then...!</font>

219
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, this could mean trouble!</font>

220
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that how it is?</font>

221
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is something wrong, Captain Drake?</font>

222
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand now...</font>

223
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seeing how close this island is to Navy HQ...</font>

224
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought it was strange that there were so few marines around.</font>

225
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What has happened?</font>

226
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been decided that Fire Fist Ace, commander of Whitebeard's second division, is set to be executed!</font>

227
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If they do that, then Whitebeard is sure to make a move!</font>

228
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's gonna be a war!</font>

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Entry #15!</font>

230
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The beautiful dancer, Pascia!</font>

231
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With a splendid starting bid of 800 thousand belly,</font>

232
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the bid has risen to an amazing 7 million 200 thousand belly!</font>

233
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah... We have finally arrived.</font>

234
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well well, things are heating up now...</font>

235
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What will be the next item up for bid?!</font>

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good, the auction is still going.</font>

237
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However they're almost done.</font>

238
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This one is truly useless!</font>

239
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Have this one sold off too! I don't want him anymore.</font>

240
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll do the paperwork right away.</font>

241
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Celestial Dragon...</font>

242
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Another one showed up... One of the World Nobles...</font>

243
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys that can call an admiral from the Navy if we attack them, huh?</font>

244
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like a mermaid... Are they gonna sell one today?</font>

245
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems that mermaids are quite difficult to catch...</font>

246
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so I doubt they've got one this time.</font>

247
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, my! Saint Charlos!</font>

248
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and take me to my seat!</font>

249
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, right away, Sir!</font>

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, you are finally here, big brother Charlos?</font>

251
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, it seems we're ready...</font>

252
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Entry #16 is...</font>

253
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you believe it?! A pirate captain!</font>

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A wanted man with a bounty of 17 million belly! His name is Lacuba!</font>

255
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is a pirate famous for his delicate, intricate planning! His well built body is also worthy of note.</font>

256
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'd make an excellent transport, hard worker, or sandbag!</font>

257
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A practical choice if I ever saw one!</font>

258
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then...!</font>

259
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me, he...?!</font>

260
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He collapsed! What's going on?!</font>

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw blood!</font>

262
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hurry up and pull the curtains!</font>

263
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What just happened?</font>

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He bit his tongue.</font>

265
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He decided that he didn't want to live his life as a slave...</font>

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and figured it would be better to just die right now.</font>

267
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose that's actually a logical choice.</font>

268
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aren't they going to bring out the mermaid soon?</font>

269
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure Camie is really scared...</font>

270
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just hang in there a little longer...</font>

271
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're going to save you!</font>

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fortunately, we have the treasure from Thriller Bark!</font>

273
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks a lot, you guys...</font>

274
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is no good...</font>

275
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">God damn it! We can't sell him now... That idiot!</font>

276
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The mermaid is up next, right?</font>

277
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes. We're ready to get her whenever you want us to.</font>

278
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

279
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get her out, now!</font>

280
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

281
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, about #16!</font>

282
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would appear that the pirate Lacuba got a little nervous... He had a nosebleed, and collapsed.</font>

283
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll put him up for sale again later.</font>

284
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, everyone...!</font>

285
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The next item we're going to bring out now...</font>

286
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is a super deluxe-item that's sure to make you forget all about this trouble!</font>

287
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Countless people have tried to capture one...</font>

288
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please look at this silhouette!</font>

289
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...?!</font>

290
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An introduction should not be necessary... Just have a look with your own eyes!</font>

291
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for your patience! Well then, here it comes!</font>

292
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a good look at this!</font>

293
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straight from Fishman Island...</font>

294
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie, the mermaid!!!</font>

295
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's real! A young mermaid!</font>

296
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin and the others! They're here to save me!</font>

297
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie! They've brought out Camie!</font>

298
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, we're gonna take her back!</font>

299
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got 200 million after all!</font>

300
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

301
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finally! A mermaid! They're selling a mermaid!</font>

302
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Five hundred million!!</font>

303
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll buy it for 500 million belly!</font>

304
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No use... We can't beat that...</font>

305
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that? We don't have that much!</font>

306
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've gone and wasted our money again.</font>

307
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You already have piranhas in your fish tank, do you not?</font>

308
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like too see them try and chase after her...</font>

309
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaids are the fastest sea-creatures in the world.</font>

310
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't hear the voices outside...</font>

311
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get me out of here, Hacchin!</font>

312
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would appear that the audience has been rendered speechless...</font>

313
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, does anyone want to make a higher bid than 500 million?</font>

314
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's gotta be something we can do...</font>

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji?</font>

316
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami?</font>

317
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This can't be happening! They can't take our friend away just because we don't have enough money!</font>

318
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad... We never considered this possibility...</font>

319
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we can't get her back with money, then the situation has gotten even worse!</font>

320
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If not, then this auction will be quite a short one!</font>

321
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now that it's come to this, I might as well just take her back by force and run off to the sea!</font>

322
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be ridiculous! What about the neck-ring?</font>

323
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd just blow her up!</font>

324
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I just have to get the key to that ring somehow...</font>

325
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's enough time!</font>

326
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did it!</font>

327
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's like a symbol of how messed up the world is...</font>

328
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen enough of this farce. We're leaving.</font>

329
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, thank you for your attention up until now.</font>

330
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The main prize this time, the mermaid Camie...</font>

331
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">goes to the World Noble, Saint Charlos for the price of 500 million belly...</font>

332
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's...</font>

333
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

334
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...a deal!</font>

335
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

336
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How noisy.</font>

337
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

338
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the heck?! Couldn't you land any better than that?!</font>

339
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way! It's a Flying Fish, you know!</font>

340
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it was you who told me to crash into the building!</font>

341
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, you told me to get on...</font>

342
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why were you in such a hurry to get back to the Sunny anyway?</font>

343
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are we?</font>

344
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro, too?</font>

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys!</font>

346
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, that's Straw Hat Luffy!</font>

347
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with those guys? Who are they?</font>

348
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Camie!</font>

349
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

350
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie! I looked for you!</font>

351
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank God!</font>

352
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second, Straw Hat! What are you doing?</font>

353
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?! Camie's right there!</font>

354
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's there, but she's got an exploding neck-ring attached! So you can't just take her!</font>

355
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, the Celestial Dragons are here!</font>

356
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I care!</font>

357
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a pirate!</font>

358
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Camie!</font>

359
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just stop already!</font>

360
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A fishman!</font>

361
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's disgusting!</font>

362
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's a fishman doing here?</font>

363
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You octopus monster!</font>

364
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna save you right now, Camie!</font>

365
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get him!</font>

366
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you! Camie isn't for sale!</font>

367
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let him get any closer to the stage!</font>

368
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's a fishman doing on land?</font>

369
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, don't get any closer! It's creepy!</font>

370
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, staff! Hurry up and restrain him!</font>

371
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, don't come here!</font>

372
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go back to the sea, you monster!</font>

373
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's right!</font>

374
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get off this island!</font>

375
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get lost!</font>

376
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi! Hurry up and escape!</font>

377
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who's in trouble now!</font>

378
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm fine! What about Camie?</font>

379
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here?</font>

380
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like Robin said...</font>

381
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermen and fishmen are discriminated against on this island!</font>

382
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Discriminated against...?</font>

383
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even Camie and Hachi?!</font>

384
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hit it! I shot a fishman!</font>

385
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi!</font>

386
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm glad he shot it!</font>

387
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was afraid that if it came any closer, we might get infected by it!</font>

388
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was definitely trying to cause some trouble... After all, they've only got the brains of a fish!</font>

389
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father, please look! I caught a fishman!</font>

390
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I caught it myself, so it's for free!</font>

391
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Free! Free! An octopus for free!</font>

392
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,480

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An octopus-slave for free! Free!</font>

394
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W... Wait... Please...</font>

395
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat...</font>

396
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't... get upset...
I was just careless, that's all...</font>

397
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You promised that... even if someone was shot right before your eyes...</font>

398
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you wouldn't lay a hand on the Celestial Dragons, right?!</font>

399
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,380

400
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did so many awful things, so...</font>

401
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had this coming...</font>

402
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,660

403
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never wanted this to happen...</font>

404
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just wanted... to make up for all the things I did to Nami...!</font>

405
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was trying to help you, but...</font>

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As always...</font>

407
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,800

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi...</font>

410
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the end... I just caused you trouble...!</font>

411
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

412
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry!</font>

413
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn fish!</font>

414
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after I shot you, you keep on blabbering! You're annoying!</font>

415
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You, what's with that look of yours?!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, Straw!</font>

417
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do that, you'll be in huge trouble! Please stop!</font>

418
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that guy doing?!</font>

419
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he serious?!</font>

420
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are annoying, too!</font>
