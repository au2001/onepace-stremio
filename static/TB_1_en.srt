75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A barrel?</font>

76
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has "treasure" written on it.</font>

77
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,120
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Tribute to the Sea-God</font>

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be...</font>

80
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some lost stuff from a treasure ship?!</font>

84
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems to be liquor and food supplies.</font>

85
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can you tell without looking inside?!</font>

86
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has " Tribute to the Sea-God" written on it, doesn't it?</font>

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a floating barrel someone sends when they pray to have a safe trip.</font>

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">These offerings are sent to receive the sea's divine blessing.</font>

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In short, the word "tribute" means "to God".</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What, so it was pointless picking it up?</font>

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all it's booze, isn't it?</font>

92
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's drink it.</font>

93
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! You'll get punished!</font>

94
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll be fine as long as you pray, won't you?</font>

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I won't pray to some God.</font>

96
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's said that liquor which is cared for by the sea waves has an exceptional taste.</font>

97
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's something we must taste!</font>

98
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! Let's have a toast!</font>

99
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After drinking it, we're supposed to refill the barrel with new offerings and set it adrift again.</font>

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open it!</font>

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

102
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, God! We'll be receiving this!</font>

103
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What God?!</font>

104
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was the one that beat the hell out of this "God" at the Sky Island...</font>

105
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright! It's open!</font>

106
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something flew out!</font>

107
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

108
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A red light...?!</font>

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

110
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What does this mean?</font>

111
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The liquor flew out, sparkled and then disappeared.</font>

112
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was a flare.</font>

113
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A flare?</font>

114
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be a curse from the Sea-God?</font>

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It might have been just a prank, but...</font>

116
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Probably...</font>

117
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone might be tracking this ship from now on.</font>

118
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No way...!</font>

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Some sort of trap?!</font>

120
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By opening the barrel, we've informed someone that we're here?! {maybe it could be reworded, like "We've informed someone that we're here by opening the barrel?!"}</font>

121
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We really can't see anyone one, but...</font>

122
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This atmospheric pressure...</font>

123
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The cloud currents are moving really fast.</font>

124
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,770

130
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she says so, it must be very close! {shouldn't it be "I can't see it," as 1st line and "but if she says so, it must be very close!" as 2nd line?}</font>

131
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, which way?!</font>

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,420

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're being pushed back!</font>

136
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

137
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think <i>this</i> is all this boat can handle?</font>

138
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

139
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone raise the sails!</font>

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're bringing out the paddle!</font>

141
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That?!</font>

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I really like that! It's so cool!</font>

143
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier Dock System!</font>

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Channel Zero!</font>

145
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cola Engine!</font>

146
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Paddle Ship Sunny!</font>

147
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go!</font>

148
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on!</font>

149
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We made it through...</font>

150
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We made it through, but...</font>

151
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this sea?</font>

152
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not even night, and yet...</font>

153
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This eerie fog has made everything dark.</font>

154
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perhaps...</font>

155
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've ventured into that sea area...</font>

156
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not prepared yet!</font>

157
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've already arrived at the Fishman Island?</font>

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, first we need to get through the sea where ghosts come out.</font>

159
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

160
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down.</font>

161
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without a doubt... this area is already... the famous... {already?}</font>

162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Florian Triangle.</font>

163
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The outrageous sea where everything mysteriously disappears!</font>

164
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh?! G-Gho... G-Gho...</font>

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghosts come out, right in this sea.</font>

166
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking!</font>

167
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come everyone besides me knows about that story?!</font>

168
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We heard it from Old Lady Kokoro.</font>

169
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are living skeletons here.</font>

170
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Living skeletons?!</font>

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's just your imagination.</font>

172
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't scare him over such absurd stuff.</font>

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen, Usopp.</font>

174
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every year, more than 100 ships mysteriously vanish within this very sea.</font>

175
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moreover, it is said that a ghost ship with the souls of deceased people wanders this sea.</font>

176
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want that!</font>

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should've said that earlier!</font>

178
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what if I had?</font>

179
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would be prepared!</font>

180
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Prepared some items to disperse the evil spirits!</font>

181
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, lend me some of them too!</font>

182
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this voice?!</font>

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It appeared!</font>

184
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The ghost ship!</i></font>

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this song?</font>

186
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the song of evil spirits!</font>

187
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't listen to it!</font>

188
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Close your ears or you'll be cursed!</font>

189
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what kind of thing the ghost says to you, don't listen to him!</font>

190
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you answer back, he'll drag you to sea with him!</font>

191
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Evil spirits are always hunting travelers!</font>

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who could be... riding this ship...?</font>

193
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he's an enemy, I'll just chop his head off.</font>

194
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something... is there.</font>

195
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,070
<font face="impress bt" size="43"><i>Going to deliver...</i></font>

196
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,250
<font face="impress bt" size="43"><i>Binks' Sake...</i></font>

197
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do I have to go?</font>

198
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna go back.</font>

199
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I told you I'd go by myself.</font>

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

201
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if our ship gets cursed because of your stupidity?</font>

202
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had terrible luck!</font>

203
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-san, it's alright!</font>

204
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll protect you, Nami-san!</font>

205
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami, you wanted to find the treasure ship, didn't you?</font>

206
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way this is a treasure ship!</font>

207
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw it, didn't you?!</font>

208
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That moving skeleton!</font>

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must be the treasure's guardian.</font>

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, let's look for him!</font>

211
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Evil spirits, begone! Evil spirits, begone!</font>

212
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, rest in peace...!</font>

213
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Nice to meet you! Yohohoho!</font>

214
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,220
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Skeleton Gentleman
Brook</font>

215
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Forgive my discourtesy, I couldn't greet you when we first met.</font>

216
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}You surprised me!</font>

217
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It's been many decades since the last time I met a person.</font>

218
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Ship after ship, it's the same, just ghost ships wandering around here.</font>

219
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It's kind of scary!</font>

220
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}Well, make yourselves at home and come inside.</font>

221
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}We'll be able to talk more relaxed.</font>

222
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, it's talking!</font>

223
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The afro-skeleton is talking!</font>

224
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!</font>

225
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, my!</font>

226
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a lovely young lady!</font>

227
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Beautiful indeed!</font>

228
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eh... no... not at all...</font>

229
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a good eye for beautiful ladies!</font>

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although, skeletons don't have eyes!</font>

231
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you please show me your panties?</font>

232
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if!</font>

233
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My, my, quite a harsh one!</font>

234
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The flesh came right off of my bones...</font>

235
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I'm only a skeleton.</font>

236
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up!</font>

237
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, can you poop?</font>

238
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are plenty of other questions to ask besides that!</font>

239
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I can.</font>

240
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need to answer!</font>

241
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nevermind that!</font>

242
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Firstly! Although you're nothing but bones, how can you be alive and talk?!</font>

243
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What exactly are you?</font>

244
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you here?</font>

245
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening on this ship?!</font>

246
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what's happening on this sea?!</font>

247
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer all of this now!</font>

248
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nevermind all that.</font>

249
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey you!</font>

250
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Join my crew!</font>

251
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sure, why not.</font>

252
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How do you do?</font>

253
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm afraid that while traveling, my ship ran into quite a bit of trouble!</font>

254
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am "Just Dead Bones" Brook!</font>

255
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pleasure to meet you!</font>

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell?!</font>

257
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is this guy?!</font>

258
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my, oh my!</font>

259
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How harsh!</font>

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a skeleton!</font>

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, what a beautiful woman!</font>

262
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you allow me to see your panties?</font>

263
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, you perverted skeleton!</font>

264
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it! Skeletons can't talk, or walk, or have afros!</font>

265
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a dream!</font>

266
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's gotta be a dream!</font>

267
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

268
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relief... just a dream...</font>

269
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy!</font>

270
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with this guy?</font>

271
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't he funny?</font>

272
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's part of our crew now.</font>

273
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't care, I won't let him be!</font>

274
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why the hell did you guys go with him?</font>

275
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wasn't it to stop him from doing something like this?!</font>

276
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry...</font>

277
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's nothing to get so worked up about.</font>

278
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go inside now.</font>

279
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can have dinner!</font>

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who are you to decide that?!</i></font>

281
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, what a wonderful dining room!</font>

282
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the kitchen!</font>

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is such a marvelous ship!</font>

284
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's 'cuz this super guy made it!</font>

285
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've really got an eye for quality.</font>

286
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, don't get attached to him, Franky.</font>

287
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what I'm truly looking forward to is the food.</font>

288
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't had any good food for so many years...</font>

289
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:46,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've lived so long with these hunger pains that I feared I was just skin and bones...</font>

290
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I'm a skeleton and don't have any skin at all!</font>

291
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skull joke!</font>

292
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As a gentleman, I enjoy the time spent awaiting my meal...</font>

293
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dinner, yeah!</font>

294
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Food! Food!</font>

295
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chef, please bring me some milk to drink!</font>

296
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just shut up and wait!</font>

297
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So anyway, Korobokle...</font>

298
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, it's Brook.</font>

299
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't yet have your name...?</font>

300
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me?</font>

301
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Luffy.</font>

302
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, anyway, what are you?</font>

303
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You two didn't even ask that kind of thing?!</font>

304
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can get rid of the skeleton later.</font>

305
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now, it's time to eat!</font>

306
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">An entire octopus meal.</font>

307
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks good!</font>

308
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Brook, make sure you eat a lot!</font>

309
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji's food is the best!</font>

310
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but...</font>

311
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm afraid that my heart is even emptier than my stomach...</font>

312
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My fair lady, your portion seems to be a little large.</font>

313
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you care to trade?</font>

314
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a lot more left, so just eat your own!</font>

315
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Revival Fruit?</font>

316
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you ate a devil fruit....</font>

317
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's correct.</font>

318
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To tell you the truth, I died once years ago.</font>

319
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, clean your face off.</font>

320
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How'd you get yourself so dirty?</font>

321
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Revival Fruit...</font>

322
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grants the ability to resurrect, so as a "resurrection human"…</font>

323
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have the promise of a second life.</font>

324
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's quite a mysterious ability.</font>

325
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, at that time, I was a pirate just like you.</font>

326
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me.</font>

327
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me.</font>

328
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just wanna beat some manners into you...</font>

329
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long ago...</font>

330
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the ship I was on before,</font>

331
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The crew I was a part of came to this sea of devils.</font>

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

333
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unluckily for us, incredibly powerful foes appeared.</font>

334
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our whole crew was killed in battle.</font>

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I, of course, died as well.</font>

336
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I was alive, the Revival Fruit simply made me unable to swim...</font>

337
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, that day the fruit became more than just that!</font>

338
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My soul...</font>

339
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has returned from the underworld to this world!</font>

340
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I was able to find my body quickly, I would have been revived.</font>

341
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, as you can see, the fog makes this sea difficult to navigate.</font>

342
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I became lost!</font>

343
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I searched for my body as a lost soul for an entire year.</font>

344
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And finally, I found it!</font>

345
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, my body had been reduced to nothing but bones!</font>

346
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I saw it, my eyes widened very much in surprise...</font>

347
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I have no eyes!</font>

348
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so stupid!</font>

349
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got lost just like Zoro!</font>

350
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.</font>

351
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's when you became a talking skeleton?</font>

352
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know a devil fruit could even bring someone back to life...</font>

353
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But even after you come back to life, you're still unable to swim,</font>

354
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">so now you're just cursed.</font>

355
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But normally hair can't grow on bones...</font>

356
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen a skeleton with an afro before.</font>

357
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I just had strong roots.</font>

358
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever you say...</font>

359
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, that means you aren't a ghost?</font>

360
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're human?</font>

361
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though you're not really...</font>

362
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, I dislike ghosts myself!</font>

363
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I see one, I cry out in fear!</font>

364
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you ever looked in a mirror?</font>

365
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, not a mirror!</font>

366
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey, w-wait a s-sec!</font>

367
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-You...</font>

368
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you...</font>

369
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why don't you have a reflection in the mirror?!</font>

370
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A vampire?!</font>

371
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

372
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Awesome!</font>

373
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-Now that you mention it,</font>

374
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't have a shadow either!</font>

375
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's right!</font>

376
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you really?!</font>

377
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you so calm?</font>

378
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-We're all really scared here! Because of you!</font>

379
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll tell you this.</font>

380
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been traveling this sea for so many years...</font>

381
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:55,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, me being a skeleton and having no shadow are two unrelated matters.</font>

382
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To be continued.</font>

383
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, tell us <i>now</i>!</font>

384
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My shadow was stolen from me years ago.</font>

385
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stolen?</font>

386
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your shadow?</font>

387
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After seeing you here living and talking, I'm not really surprised by anything you say...</font>

388
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But can that really happen?</font>

389
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it can.</font>

390
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:25,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Having my shadow stolen from me means that I am no longer able to exist in the world's light.</font>

391
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to be hit with the light of the sun...</font>

392
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body would...</font>

393
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body would disintegrate!</font>

394
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I once saw...</font>

395
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:51,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Someone with this same curse disappear when bathed in sunlight...</font>

396
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was enough to make my hair stand on end!</font>

397
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although I'm a skeleton.</font>

398
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow is reflected on the ground by sunlight.</font>

399
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:11,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Therefore, I myself cannot be reflected in something like a mirror or photograph.</font>

400
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And here I exist, unable to be in light, with all my crewmates long dead!</font>

401
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your life's been pretty miserable.</font>

402
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I lived through it all!</font>

403
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though I'm just bones.</font>

404
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm "Just Dead Bones" Brook!</font>

405
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a pleasure to meet you!</font>

406
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're you so happy?</font>

407
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey hey, what's wrong?</font>

408
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You okay?</font>

409
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today is such a marvelous day!</font>

410
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen people once more!</font>

411
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For so many years I've sailed through this ocean,</font>

412
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fog making it so dark I couldn't even tell when the days passed...</font>

413
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All my crewmates were dead...</font>

414
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was all alone on a ship that couldn't steer...</font>

415
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sailing aimlessly for many, many years...</font>

416
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was <i>so</i> lonely!</font>

417
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So very lonely,</font>

418
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And so very scared...</font>

419
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just wanted to die...</font>

420
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I lived on...</font>

421
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People are my happiness!</font>

422
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of you are my joy!</font>

423
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so happy that I would cry if I were able!</font>

424
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You asked me to join your crew, correct?</font>

425
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That made me very happy, thank you very much.</font>

426
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I must refuse your offer.</font>

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?!</font>

428
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I told you before, my shadow was stolen, and I am unable to return to the light of the world.</font>

429
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now I'm being protected by the fog of this devils' sea.</font>

430
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However,</font>

431
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to leave this ocean with you, it would only be a matter of time before my body disappeared. {should this and the previous line be merged?}</font>

432
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stay here, waiting for the joyous day when I can regain my shadow!</font>

433
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you going on about?!</font>

434
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you need your shadow, I'll get it back for you.</font>

435
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said someone stole it, right?</font>

436
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was it?</font>

437
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where is he?</font>

438
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are a very kind person.</font>

439
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm surprised...</font>

440
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I won't tell you.</font>

441
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't tell you, who I've just met, to go and die for me.</font>

442
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the enemy really that strong?</font>

443
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's fine, but can't you at least tell us his name?</font>

444
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I cannot.</font>

445
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may find him if I do!</font>

446
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know if I will find him before my second life is over.</font>

447
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I do find him, I've decided I will fight him, but...</font>

448
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That aside...</font>

449
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's sing a song.</font>

450
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Music is my pride!</font>

451
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was the musician on my crew.</font>

452
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?!</font>

453
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a musician?!</font>

454
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then you've really gotta join our crew, idiot!</font>

455
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's sing a fun song together!</font>

456
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what is it?</font>

457
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

458
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-G-G...</font>

459
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ghost!</font>

460
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's something there!</font>

461
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared, there's a ghost!</font>

462
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cool!</font>

463
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm getting out of here!</font>

464
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why're we shaking?</font>

465
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... it can't be...!</font>

466
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a thing to happen...!</font>

467
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those guys're watching this ship?!</font>

468
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please look!</font>

469
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship is being blocked!</font>

470
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is what caused that shaking!</font>

471
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the back of the gate...</font>

472
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gate?</font>

473
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means...!</font>

474
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the back of the ship!</font>

475
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

476
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you, perhaps, pick up a floating barrel...?</font>

477
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We did!</font>

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was a trap!</font>

479
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This ship has been targeted since then.</font>

480
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

481
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been right here the whole time...</font>

482
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is there an island there?</font>

483
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the wandering ghost island...</font>

484
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thriller Bark.</font>

485
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold on...</font>

486
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The log pose isn't reacting at all!</font>

487
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's correct.</font>

488
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is because this island traveled here from the distant West Blue.</font>

489
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, but today is such a lucky day.</font>

490
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not only did I see people once more, but my deepest wish has come true as well!</font>

491
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's so light...!</font>

492
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

493
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since I'm "just dead bones", I have to be light!</font>

494
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now please, find a way to go through that gate behind you and leave this place.</font>

495
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do not drop anchor here.</font>

496
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was so happy to meet you.</font>

497
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will never forget your delicious food!</font>

498
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Farewell!</font>

499
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If fate will have it, let us meet again!</font>

500
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait, Brook!</font>

501
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't he eat a devil fruit?!</font>

502
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you doing?!</font>

503
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's running on the water!</font>

504
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Woah, cool!</font>

505
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Anyway, Luffy...</font>

506
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do what he said!</font>

507
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't know what's going on here, but we do know that it's dangerous!</font>

508
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you say something?</font>

509
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's going!</font>
