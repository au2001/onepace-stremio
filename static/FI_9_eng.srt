92
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

93
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, if you didn't bring a pinup girl with you?!</font>

94
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll introduce ya.  This is Wimp.</font>

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Wimp, huh?
Sounds like you need to get your act together.</font>

96
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, sorry for troubling you.  My name is Shirahoshi.</font>

97
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,540

98
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, Robin was here too,</font>

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but then she went off in search of something.</font>

100
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She went into that huge coral forest.</font>

104
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,370

105
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been quite a while.</font>

106
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like you're quite a bit stronger.  I can see the difference.</font>

107
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard you weren't down here,
so I didn't think I'd be able to see you.</font>

108
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?
Didn't you get my message to meet me here?</font>

109
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about that.</font>

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's strange.</font>

111
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe-sama,
it's certainly been quite a while since we last met.</font>

112
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry for failing to keep in touch with you,
Princess Shirahoshi-sam-</font>

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaat!</i></font>

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Princess Shirahoshi!  Why are you here?!</i></font>

115
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Franky!  I wanna bring
Hachi and Sanji down, so give me a hand.</font>

116
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

117
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it ain't the octopus guy!</font>

118
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to ya?</font>

119
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hachi!  What!</i></font>

120
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did those injuries come from?</font>

121
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More importantly,
why are you on Fishman Island?</font>

122
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weren't you captured along with Arlong?</font>

123
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san, why are you here?</font>

124
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky!  Sanji's next!</font>

125
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, it's not that bad.</font>

126
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

127
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, Mermaid Princess!</font>

128
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before you, I am like an artist with no talent.</font>

129
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For you see, there is no brush
that could properly capture your radiance!</font>

130
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Well...</font>

131
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's... his normal reaction
in the presence of women!  He's all better!</font>

132
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My canvas could never reflect the beauty
that you possess.</font>

133
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hooray!  Hooray!
Sanji's returned to his normal strange self!</font>

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sure is loud over there... I wonder what's going on?</font>

135
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is Princess Shirahoshi here?</font>

136
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Who're you?!  Why are you on the Sunny?!</font>

137
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's Den-chan, the younger brother of Tom,
my carpentry master!</font>

138
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's fixing the ship's coating.</font>

139
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that who he is?</font>

140
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the master who's going to
coat your younger brother, huh?</font>

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's close enough!</font>

142
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Princess Shirahoshi-sama,
I understand why you wanted to come here but-</font>

143
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still?</font>

144
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even after the beating I gave him.</font>

145
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How many times has it been now?</font>

146
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's really persistent.</font>

147
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to me, now!
Why'd you bring the Princess here, Luffy-kun?</font>

148
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's fine!  I'm here, after all!</font>

149
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

150
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is she thinking?</font>

151
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's the tomb she was talking about?</font>

152
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's really been going at it for a long time, now.</font>

153
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is where her mother, Queen Otohime, is resting.</font>

154
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken started his obstinate courtship...</font>

155
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">right after the Queen passed away.</font>

156
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of this,
the Princess couldn't even attend her mother's funeral,</font>

157
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and she's spent ten years in Koukaku Tower.</font>

158
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must have so many things she wants to tell her mother.</font>

159
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

160
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-chin!</font>

161
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!  Caimie!</font>

162
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait.  Princess Shirahoshi is there, too.</font>

163
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaat!</i></font>

164
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami!  Has the banquet started yet?</font>

165
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-swaaaaaaaan!</font>

166
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">He's completely recovered.</font>

167
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!  What happened to you?</font>

168
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie.</font>

169
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure?  Hody did such a thing?</font>

170
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

171
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think that the situation
at Ryuuguu Palace is so bad.</font>

172
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So what happened to Zoro and the others?</font>

173
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know.</font>

174
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought we'd go back after we found you.</font>

175
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I can't...</font>

176
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe that my father could be captured like that!</font>

177
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-kun, my apologies.</font>

178
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't want you to get in trouble,
that's why I left a message for you.</font>

179
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it seems that you've already been caught up in our affairs.</font>

180
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is important for us to hurry,</font>

181
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but when I met you two years ago the circumstances were different,</font>

182
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and I couldn't tell you this story at that time.</font>

183
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:45,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to offer you my most profound gratitude for stopping Arlong's crew in East Blue.</font>

184
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was you, wasn't it?</font>

185
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

186
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once again, I'd like to give my thanks.</font>

187
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But at the same time, I must apologize.</font>

188
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san.</font>

189
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who set Arlong loose on East Blue eleven years ago...</font>

190
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was me.</font>

191
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Neptune.</font>

192
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't turn back!  Do you want the king's kindness to go to waste?</font>

193
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's the exit!</font>

194
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!  We managed to get out!</font>

195
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Use the Bubbly Corals!</font>

196
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can this be?!  Not only did we leave the king in the castle alone...</font>

197
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the guards were the only ones
who made it out!  What a disgrace!</font>

198
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop crying about it!  This was the king's order!</font>

199
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Men!  This is not a retreat!</font>

200
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will definitely take out the pirates
inside the palace, and rescue the king!</font>

201
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But first, we need to contact
Fukaboshi and the other princes!</font>

202
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As soon as we've gotten in touch with the princes, and got reinforcements from their troops,</font>

203
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we will return to Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

212
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,770

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's... What do you expect us to do?!</font>

214
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Step on it.</font>

215

216
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a test.</font>

217
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be absurd!</font>

218

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and Princess Shirahoshi was abducted by the pirate with the straw hat right before our eyes!</font>

265
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the princess said she'd be back by dinner.</font>

266
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot!  He obviously forced her to say that!</font>

267
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently the people from the Fishman District are causing disturbances in several cities.</font>

268
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

269
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening on this island?!</font>

270
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Young mermaids are disappearing all over the island...</font>

271
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What if the princess ends up
being sold to the Celestial Dragons?!</font>

272
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Another young mermaid seems to have disappeared!</font>

273
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How scary!</font>

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awful!</font>

275
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's my doing...</font>

276
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But more importantly, I just saw something amazing!</font>

277
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Big Sized Mermaid!</i></font>

278
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If a human-sized mermaid
is worth seventy million beli...</font>

279
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then if I could capture that Mermaid Princess, who is seven or eight times as big...</font>

280
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then sell her off!</font>

281
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's such a huge sum, I can hardly even imagine it!</font>

282
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">You...</font>

283
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why, good day to you!</font>

284
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Father.</font>

285
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is alright, Princess Shirahoshi.</font>

286
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if they manage to restrain the king,
they won't get the chance to actually harm him.</font>

287
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

288
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.  I promise I will save the king!</font>

289
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright.  Please do, Boss.</font>

290
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I'd like some time to speak
to Luffy-kun and his friends first.</font>

291
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dear ladies...</font>

292
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I made tea.</font>

293
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks.  Leave it there, Sanji-kun.</font>

294
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Also, we're trying to have a serious conversation, so quit goofing around.</font>

295
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Oh Nami-san, I love it when you're strict!</i></font>

296
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You haven't changed, Sanji-chin.</font>

297
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Delicious.</font>

298
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't make it for <i>you!</i></font>

299
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, Jinbe-san...</font>

300
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What did you mean?</font>

301
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You said you were the one who set Arlong loose on East Blue.</font>

302
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san...</font>

303
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

304
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I heard about that.</font>

305
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long ago, when Luffy and I first heard about the Warlord Jinbe...</font>

306
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yosaku told us that.</font>

307
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>In exchange for a place among the Seven Warlords of the Sea...</i></font>

308
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Jinbe unleashed a terrible guy upon East Blue.</i></font>

309
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm, did he?</font>

310
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knowing you, you probably just forgot.</font>

311
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"></font>

312
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder how Yosaku's doing?</font>

313
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two years ago, when I read that article
that said you and Jinbe were working together...</font>

314
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It set question marks dancing around inside my head.</font>

315
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd always assumed that Jinbe was
the mastermind controlling Arlong from the shadows.</font>

316
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Jinbe.</font>

317
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have some excuse then I'm willing to listen...</font>

318
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but choose your words carefully.</font>

319
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no need to hide it.
The hometown of our beautiful navigator Nami-san...</font>

320
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was on the island that Arlong took over.</font>

321
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:28,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As a result, she's been put through hell.</font>

322
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If what you just said is true...</font>

323
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I will never forgive you.</font>

324
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe-san...</font>

325
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hacchin!</font>

326
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your wounds will reopen!  You can't move around yet!</font>

327
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's true!  The scars we left her...</font>

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are so deep that we can never be forgiven, no matter how much we apologize.</font>

329
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm going to travel across the oceans of the world,
using my own navigational skills!</i></font>

330
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And then I'll draw a map of the entire world,
based on the things I've seen!</i></font>

331
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then this map you drew of the island is the first step toward your dream?</i></font>

332
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

333
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I am your adopted mother, after all.</i></font>

334
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You two are my precious family.</i></font>

335
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Pirates!  Pirates are coming!</i></font>

336
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Greetings... you disgusting, pitiful humans.</i></font>

337
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>From now on, this village...</i></font>

338
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No, this entire island, belongs to me!</i></font>

339
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>One hundred thousand beli for each adult.</i></font>

340
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Fifty thousand beli for every child.</i></font>

341
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>We will kill anyone who doesn't pay this tax!</i></font>

342
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Die for your ridiculous love.</i></font>

343
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nojiko!  Nami!</i></font>

344
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I love you.</i></font>

345
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What's this?  A map?</i></font>

346
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't!</i></font>

347
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I drew that map!  It's my treasure!</i></font>

348
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Give it back!</i></font>

349
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You drew this?</i></font>

350
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Give it back!</i></font>

351
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Don't, Nami!</i></font>

352
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Very impressive.</i></font>

353
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>She will be useful.  Bring her along.</i></font>

354
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Right.</i></font>

355
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i><i>No!  Let go!  Let go of me!</i></i></font>

356
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i><i>No!  Don't!</i></i></font>

357
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Why should I have to feed a human?</i></font>

358
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Just shut up and keep drawing maps!</i></font>

359
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Gather up one hundred million beli,
and bring it here to me.</i></font>

360
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If you can do that,
I will release your village and set you free.</i></font>

361
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Thief!  She stole our treasure!</i></font>

362
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's just a kid!</i></font>

363
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I don't care!  Kill her!</i></font>

364
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Damn it!  Chase her down!</i></font>

365
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Seventy million more.</i></font>

366
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>If I can get seventy million more beli, I can...</i></font>

367
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Oh, I'm impressed that you came back.</i></font>

368
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Heh, not like you had any other choice.</i></font>

369
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Welcome back, my cartographer.</i></font>

370
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It sounds like you've suffered a lot.</font>

371
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't talk like this doesn't concern you!</font>

372
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

373
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever happened to him,
I'm never gonna feel sorry for Arlong.</font>

374
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, two years ago,</font>

375
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">before I came to the Sabaody Archipelago,
I never knew...</font>

376
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that the fishmen, despite their strength,
were discriminated against by humans.</font>

377
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When Caimie was kidnapped
and we chased after her, I doubted my own eyes.</font>

378
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I saw the Sabaody Park, and it looked exactly like the Arlong Park that Arlong built.</font>

379
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We always longed for it.</font>

380
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not saying this because I want forgiveness, Nami.</font>

381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Arlong-san hated humans...</font>

382
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He held a grudge against them.</font>

383
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We went too far.</font>

384
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, ever since we were children...</font>

385
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we longed for the world
that humans lived in, and that's a fact.</font>

386
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both me, Arlong-san...</font>

387
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and all the others.</font>

388
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently, in the past,
humans and fishmen were divided...</font>

389
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but then Ryuuguu Kingdom became a part
of the World Government two hundred years ago.</font>

390
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In order to form diplomatic ties with the humans...</font>

391
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the king was given a place in the world council.</font>

392
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But humans continued to hate fishmen.</font>

393
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The worst time I've experienced in my life was when the Great Pirate Age began.</font>

394
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can still remember the fear of seeing human pirates coming and running wild on this island.</font>

395
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never forget it.</font>

396
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fishman Island was occupied by humans.</font>

397
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who saved us was the late old Whitebeard.</font>

398
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Old Man announced that he was making Fishman Island his turf,</font>

399
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and peace returned to the island.</font>

400
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it didn't put an end to
the humans' hate of fishmen.</font>

401
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure you all saw it too, on Sabaody.</font>

402
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The harsh reality.</font>

403
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's strange how it goes...</font>

404
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once someone has gained power, they are terrified of change.</font>

405
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Government decided that
humans and fishmen should coexist.</font>

406
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yet the ones who held power and made that decision discriminated against us more than anyone else!</font>

407
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The relationship between humans and fishmen
didn't change at all.</font>

408
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of that,
two people rose up here on Fishman Island...</font>

409
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in an attempt to put an end to this despicable history.</font>

410
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The first one was Queen Otohime.</font>

411
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess Shirahoshi's mother, who encouraged the islanders to live in peace with humans.</font>

412
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the other was the hero who freed the slaves...</font>

413
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger.</font>

414
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something Tiger...
I think I've heard about him before.</font>

415
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He proclaimed that he would
cut our ties with the humans...</font>

416
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he broke a worldwide taboo.  He went into
the Holy Land of Mariejoa and attacked them, alone.</font>

417
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He freed the slaves.</font>

418
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And after that, he brought all
the former fishman slaves together,</font>

419
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and formed the Sun Pirates!</font>

420
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sun...</font>

421
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.  I, Arlong, and Hachi.</font>

422
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally, we were all...</font>

423
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">members of the Sun Pirates.</font>

424
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, having the fishman pirates out at sea, fiercely fighting against the World Government...</font>

425
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:29,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">made it harder for Queen Otohime,
who was trying to unite humans and fishmen.</font>

426
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unlike Queen Otohime, who wanted to
endure the present and change the future...</font>

427
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:43,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger abandoned such hopes for the future,
and saved fishman slaves who suffered in the present.</font>

428
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one can say for sure which one was right.</font>

429
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me tell you...</font>

430
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">about these two great people, who attempted to change the destiny between humans and fishmen.</font>

431
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And about the screams of their souls.</font>

432
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Queen Otohime, who tried to guide the kingdom to a future where humans and fishmen could coexist.</font>

433
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the hero, Fisher Tiger, who attempted to free the slaves and fight back against the humans.</font>

434
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:23,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fates of these two, overlapped, and a great event that would change history began!</font>

435
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:31,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fisher Tiger forms the sun Pirates, and has a fateful encounter with a girl who lived through a cruel reality!</font>

436
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next time, on One Pace:</font>

437
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,090

The Fateful Encounter!</b></font>
