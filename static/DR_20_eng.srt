00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And we'll knock you unconscious!</font>

130
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unconscious?</font>

131
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know anything about your comrades.</font>

132
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!</i></font>

135
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really.</font>

136
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay then.</font>

137
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not okay! Don't let her trick you!</font>

138
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-That was close! Give back our comrades!</font>

139
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who told you all this? You're clearly too dumb to realize that you're being tricked.</font>

140
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I had been wondering why the Tontattans
haven't been seen in the palace for the past year.</font>

141
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it was because someone has been deceiving you.</font>

142
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Silence!</i></font>

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold her down and force her mouth open!</font>

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How insulting. It feels like
you're underestimating me...</font>

145
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Little Black Bears!</font>

146
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time to make the contract.</font>

147
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! She turned us into toys!</font>

148
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Obey my orders until you die.</font>

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have we all been forgotten?! {Uh, haven't they said that EVERYONE forgets the people who turn into toys? In that case, what's with all this "we"-stuff? You shouldn't even be aware that there WERE others charging alongside you just now. -Starfish}</font>

150
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

151
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A bunch of toys showed up out of nowhere.</font>

152
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What were we just doing?</font>

153
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slaughter all the intruders in the Commanders' Tower!</font>

154
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't resist her orders!</font>

155
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Slaughter all of them... Even me?!</font>

156
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't! I don't want to fight!</font>

157
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those must be Sugar's subordinates!</font>

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe she had more backup aside from Trébol!</font>

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo! It's me, Flapper!</font>

160
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take down the enemy soldiers!</font>

161
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! No! No!</font>

162
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Nooo!</i></font>

163
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol, come back! It's a trap!</font>

164
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol!</font>

165
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A trap?</font>

166
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you!</font>

167
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at that, Trébol-sama!</font>

168
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The pirates are causing a commotion. We can't deal with them!</font>

169
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, you! {Swashy-B: So I put a comma here because it's correct but it just doesn't look right. Someone double check this please.}</font>

170
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's the problem?</font>

171
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol-sama!</font>

172
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's up?</font>

173
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it's not really a problem...
Just, a bunch of bees that were in the cargo.</font>

174
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no problem with the deal.</font>

175
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That woman!</font>

176
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey, wait, wait!</font>

177
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You!</font>

178
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, who are you? Hey!</font>

179
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She disappeared! Hey! Hey!{OH FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, *SHUT THE FUCK UP*. -Starfish}</font>

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But wait... That face...</font>

181
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was she one of the Straw Hats?!</font>

182
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How'd she get here?</font>

183
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol!</font>

184
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are they after Sugar?</font>

185
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back here! You've been tricked!</font>

186
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die, you imbecile!</font>

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now I'm mad!</font>

188
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sticky Chain! {TL note? -Fadeout4}</font>

189
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sticky Stick...{should this be "sticky stick" or "sticky sticky"? -Kae}{Xemnas: I prefer" Sticky stick".}</font>

190
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meteor!</font>

191
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Trébol-sama has gone mad!</font>

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Commander's Tower has been crushed!</font>

193
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Usopp, get a hold of yourself.</font>

194
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness.</font>

195
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rob-</font>

196
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What happened?</font>

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A duck suddenly fell from the ceiling.</font>

198
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo and the others have been captured.</font>

199
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are others, as well, right?</font>

200
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, right?</font>

201
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are their names?</font>

202
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll never talk!</font>

203
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, don't tell them!</font>

204
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out of here while we can, Robin.</font>

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See, the other guy is my friend.</font>

206
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think his name was...</font>

207
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you mean Usoland?</font>

208
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

209
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot, he's not my friend.</font>

210
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit, you tricked me.</font>

211
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is the one-legged soldier one of your people too?</font>

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I won't talk.</font>

213
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We already know.</font>

214
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you already know then there's no point in hiding it.</font>

215
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's our comrade.</font>

216
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I knew it.</font>

217
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit.</font>

218
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm starting to connect all the dots.</font>

219
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you figure it all out, it's over for you.</font>

220
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will get our friends back!</font>

221
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That sticky stuff is also combustible.</font>

222
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on now!?</font>

223
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trébol-sama!</font>

224
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo, Leo!</font>

225
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get out...</font>

226
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, you have to get out of here.</font>

227
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys can't go any further.</font>

228
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't stand a chance against Trébol.</font>

229
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We... can't do that.</font>

230
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:40,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I must... hurry and complete... Operation SOP...</font>

231
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then the captain will...</font>

232
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">beat Doflamingo for us.</font>

233
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The captain is waiting for us!</font>

234
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have to hurry.</font>

235
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,650
<font face="impress bt" size="45">The Royal Palace,
1F Lift</font>

237
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,600

in Dressrosa.</font>

238
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo-sama is stepping down as a Warlord?</font>

239
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he going to abdicate as well?</font>

240
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's just a pirate now!</font>

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now he'll be hunted by the Navy!</font>

242
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna be free!</font>

243
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain, did you see the newspaper?</font>

244
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now our comrades will come back, right?</font>

245
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't have to fight after all!</font>

246
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a relie-</font>

247
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it was a false report.</font>

248
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!</font>

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so glad it was a mistake!</font>

250
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way someone as great as him would just leave the throne.</font>

251
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo-sama!</font>

252
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna enter today's tournament and get the Mera Mera Fruit.</font>

253
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then I'm gonna kill Doflamingo!</font>

254
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca, keep calm.</font>

255
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I understand your anger.</font>

256
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I feel the same way...</font>

257
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but don't do anything rash.</font>

258
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will be the ones to fight.</font>

259
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything's prepared.</font>

260
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I won't wait!</font>

261
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've been plunged from heaven to hell.</font>

266
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That isn't even hope!</font>

267
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a wall of despair!</font>

268
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legendary gladiator with three thousand wins, Kyros?</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone knows that statue is a lie.{Is the "bronze"-part really necessary here? I mean yeah, it is in the Japanese line, but is that really such an essential detail that taking it out would hurt the story? No, I think not. -Starfish}</font>

270
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kyros is some ideal warrior the dying prisoners dreamt up.</font>

271
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A statue full of wishes that they
can succeed and get out of here.</font>

272
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rather than putting my hopes in a stupid dream,</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't possibly win. {Copy Paste from 657}</font>

276
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll just be throwing your life away! I refuse to let you enter!</font>

277
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're so hot-headed!</font>

278
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're only sixteen!</font>

279
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think yourself an adult, Rebecca?!</font>

280
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're still a child!</font>

281
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to what I say!</font>

282
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quit talking like you're my father!</font>

283
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one getting heated up.</font>

284
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What plan?!</font>

285
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way you can beat Doflamingo!</font>

286
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just a one-legged toy!</font>

287
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed...</font>

288

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right. {if somebody wants to split this, that would be cool. -Kae} {Split by Donfong}</font>

289
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, wait!</font>

290
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I may have said too much.</font>

291
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But please, don't enter.</font>

292
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't mean it.</font>

293
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san, wait!</font>

294
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Soldier-san!</font>

295
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was afraid that you'd die and got scared!</font>

296
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry!</font>

297
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Soldier-san!</font>

298
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

299
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh my!</font>

300
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca, who has never initiated an attack, has begun attacking!</font>

301
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that sword?</font>

302
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no edge.</font>

303
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an arena for killing.</font>

304
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're not gonna cut someone, then get cut yourself.</font>

305
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That'll get the audience riled up.</font>

306
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lock!</font>

307
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A direct hit!</font>

308
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The undefeated woman was completely helpless!</font>

309

310
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!</font>

311
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Musclemelon!</font>

312
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Bartolomeo.</font>

313
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Protect that girl.</font>

314
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca, do you know how your mother Scarlett died?</font>

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll go get us something to eat. {Copy paste from ep 651}</i></font>

316
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way that toy soldier was crying was truly pathetic.</font>

317
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'm sorry, {copy paste from 651}</i></font>

321
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be Pica.</font>

322
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is he thrashing about?</font>

323
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let you follow them!</font>

324
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay, Captain?</font>

325
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">T-Thanks.</font>

326
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to hurry.</font>

327
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, they'll die!</font>

328
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me, you damn gnomes!</font>

329
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look ahead, captain!</font>

330
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We were prepared for it from the start.</font>

331
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be stupid!</font>

332
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you don't make it then what's gonna happen?</font>

333
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if Leo and the others complete Operation SOP, if we don't beat Doflamingo, nothing will change!</font>

334
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the only one who can kill Doflamingo, Captain!</font>

336
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's your captain, Leo?</font>

337
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you betting everything on him?</font>

338
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just a one-legged toy!</font>

339
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When new toys are turned, they are bound
by a contract that blocks their will to resist.</font>

340
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? What's that?!</font>

341
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But in the case of our captain, the first toy who was ever created in this country...</font>

342
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:04,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sugar made the mistake of
not forcing a contract on him.</font>

343
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:17,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Due to that single mistake ten years ago, he is the only toy able to defy the Donquixote Family.</font>

344
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:27,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why the captain has been fighting on his own for ten years.</font>

345
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it weren't for him, the toys could only cry themselves to sleep.</font>

346
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We Tontattans wouldn't have noticed a thing.</font>

347
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'd have all been turned into their slaves.</font>

348
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we ignore his screams, then there's no saving this country!</font>

349
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is worth betting everything on!</font>

350
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one remembers him now...</font>

351
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but long ago, everyone knew his name.</font>

352
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when he was a big human, his name was...</font>

353
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kyros!</font>

354
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The strongest gladiator in the Colosseum's history!</font>

355
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He is our captain!</font>
