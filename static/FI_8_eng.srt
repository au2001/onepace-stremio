<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you'd just offer them a cup of tea instead?!</font>

60
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, we should have offered them

we have no way to find out what they were after!</font>

63
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And why should I care?  That's your problem.</font>

64
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It feels like things are going from bad to worse.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is our crew filled with people like him?</font>

66
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, look at the captain...</font>

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  There's no use thinking about it.</font>

68
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if Luffy-san met the Mermaid Princess?</font>

69
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like to meet her as well.</font>

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't say that, just free me from these chains!</font>

71
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give Shirahoshi back -jamon!</font>

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Again, why would we kidnap
the Mermaid Princess in the first place?</font>

73
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The culprit is Straw Hat Luffy -jamon!  Shirahoshi!</font>

74
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, while I certainly saw
Luffy-san and the shark come out of that room,</font>

75
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I saw no sign of anyone
resembling a Mermaid Princess.</font>

76
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she would never leave the castle on her own -jamon!</font>

77
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi is as large as I am -jamon.</font>

78
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no way she could leave without being seen!</font>

79
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  The Mermaid Princess is huge?!</font>

80
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah'm the princess -jamon!</font>

81
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is absurd.</font>

82
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I know -jamon!  He must have stuffed
Shirahoshi inside Megalo's mouth and dragged her off!</font>

83
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't joke around in this dire situation, Your Majesty.</font>

84
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he came up with that idea,
how could he convince her to do it?</font>

85
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway, our captain would never kidnap anyone!</font>

86
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're gonna suspect someone, then pick someone else!</font>

87
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I cannot think of anyone else.</font>

88
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do not return Shirahoshi to me unharmed, I will not return your ship or crew to you either.</font>

89
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep that in mind -jamon!</font>

90
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  Why would you go that far?!</font>

91
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I did it!</font>

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like the human pirates have succeeded.</font>

93
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sunny!  You're alright!</font>

94
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really are a super miraculous ship!</font>

95
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This place is called the ship graveyard.</font>

96
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shipwrecks are carried here by the ocean currents.</font>

97
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't it ironic?</font>

98
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That a place like this would
receive the blessing of the Sunlight Tree Eve,</font>

99
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and the most beautiful corals would grow here,
attracting the fishes and whales.</font>

100
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's amazing.</font>

101
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are lots of whales here that are many times bigger than the Sunny!</font>

102
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whales can tell where the most fertile seas are,
and they gather there.</font>

103
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a wonderful sea!</font>

104
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:41,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I make a living by investigating this mysterious Sea Forest.</font>

105
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can hardly believe that this is the deep sea.</font>

106
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The same can be said for Fishman Island too.</font>

107
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm impressed that you managed
to get wood from the Treasure Tree Adam.</font>

108
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is a fine ship,
worthy of the materials it was made of!</font>

109
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right?  The materials are the same
as the ones Tom-san used for the Pirate King's ship!</font>

110
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the blueprints were my greatest masterpiece!</font>

111
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the coating of the ship to me.
I'll handle it with a Don!</font>

112
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's really helpful, uh... what's your name again?</font>

113
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm Den.</font>

114
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Den-san!</font>

115
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, you really don't look like him.</font>

116
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a merman, and not a blowfish either.</font>

117
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you're Tom-san's little brother,</font>

118
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought you'd look more like him.</font>

119
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a very human way of thinking.</font>

120
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all, you surface-dwellers usually resemble the members of your family.</font>

121
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But that's not the case with fishmen.</font>

122
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The genes of Fishmen and Merfolk
carry the memories of their distant ancestors.</font>

123
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If an octopus mermaid gives birth to a shark merman,</font>

124
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:59,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that just means that someone
in the mermaid's ancestry was a shark merman.</font>

125
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever kind of child one gives birth to,
nobody finds it strange here on Fishman Island.</font>

126
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of that,</font>

127
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:16,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">we can't understand why you humans discriminate against each other based on appearances.</font>

128
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, were there any robots among your ancestors?</font>

129
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm human!</font>

130
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Human?</font>

131
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so your ancestors were humanoid robots?</font>

132
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm just a normal human!</font>

133
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, it doesn't matter.</font>

134
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes it does!</font>

135
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, right.
I read about you and Iceberg-kun in a letter.</font>

136
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so old Kokoro wrote you a letter?</font>

137
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'm aware of what happened.</font>

138
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My brother lived in his own way, with a Don, to the very end!</font>

139
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And you came here to tell me that in person.</font>

140
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He had a good apprentice.</font>

141
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're making me blush.</font>

142
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, so you are a robot after all!</font>

143
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, let's just say I'm a perversion of nature
and leave it at that.</font>

144
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, and I noticed that someone's
been sitting over there for a while now.</font>

145
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, that's Boss Jinbe.</font>

146
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss?</font>

147
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Apparently he's waiting for someone.</font>

148
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's a wanted man,
so he can't enter the kingdom itself.</font>

149
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Intruders!</font>

150
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you make it all the way to here?!</font>

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't believe it!</font>

152
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We thought we'd have to fight our way in here,
but Neptune and all the soldiers are already tied up!</font>

153
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never would have expected
a present like this to be waiting for us!</font>

154
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quite the surprise.</font>

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That face!</font>

156
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he doing here?!</font>

157
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you finally show yourself, despicable Vander Decken!</font>

158
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And that's...</font>

159
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody Jones from the Fishman District!</font>

160
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why has he come back here?</font>

161
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody?  Wasn't he...</font>

162
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used to be a rather proficient soldier in our army.</font>

163
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this some kind of trap?
It seems too good to be true!</font>

164
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We just keep getting more and more guests.</font>

165
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a lively palace.</font>

166
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be in league with them, right?!</font>

167
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

168
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You invited them here, didn't you?!</font>

169
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  If you guys hadn't brought us,
we wouldn't even be here in the first place!</font>

170
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are those tough-looking guys?!</font>

171
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  At least give us back our weapons!</font>

172
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please!  Let us fight!</font>

173
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken!
Now that you are here, I have no doubts!</font>

174
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You are the culprit!  Give me back my daughter!</font>

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give her back when I haven't even married her yet?
You're getting ahead of yourself, Father.</font>

176
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Do not call me Father!</i></font>

177
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you take Shirahoshi?!  She had better be safe!</font>

178
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with the attitude?
You make it sound like the princess isn't here.</font>

179
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't play dumb with me!</font>

180
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who else could be responsible for the princess suddenly disappearing from her room?!</font>

181
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>My Shirahoshi has disappeared?!</i></font>

182
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>She's mine!  She's my daughter -jamon!</i></font>

183
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama, don't get so worked up
over this guy's nonsense.</font>

184
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down, Decken.</font>

185
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look.  The humans you threw,
aiming for the Mermaid Princess, arrived here.</font>

186
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means, at the very least, that Princess Shirahoshi was still here when you threw them.</font>

187
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help.</font>

188
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, whether or not what they're saying is true,</font>

189
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you have a way of finding out where she is.</font>

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Finding out... where she is?</font>

191
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed!  Hody, you're pretty smart...</font>

192
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I presume!</font>

193
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he leaving?</font>

194
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's he planning to do?</font>

195
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, coral!  Fly toward Shirahoshi!</font>

196
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not flying toward Koukaku Tower!</font>

197
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoever it is trying to stand in the way
of our ten years of love...</font>

198
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must die!</font>

199
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And so, he let out a gigantic fart!</font>

200
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, you mustn't use such vulgar words.</font>

201
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?</font>

202
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anyone else is trying to take you as their own...</font>

203
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then I would sooner see you dead, soaked in your own blood!</font>

204
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shirahoshi!</font>

205
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken went after Shirahoshi!</font>

206
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Neptune-sama!</font>

207
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm begging you -jamon!
I'll give you whatever you want!</font>

208
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just let me go after Decken!</font>

209
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give you all of our treasure.</font>

210
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can even take my soldiers' lives if you want!</font>

211
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Hey, Your Majesty!</i></font>

212
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He'll catch Shirahoshi!</font>

213
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My beloved Shirahoshi!</font>

214
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How pitiful, Neptune.</font>

215
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I never thought that my destined enemies,
the Straw Hat Pirates,</font>

216
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">would assist us in overthrowing Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

217
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Destined enemies?</font>

218
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's Arlong's mark!</font>

219
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe told me that there was
unrest in the Fishman District...</font>

220
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I never would have guessed that you, a former member of the Neptune Army, would be behind it!</font>

221
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should be ashamed, Hody!</font>

222
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ashamed?</font>

223
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That would make sense, <i>if</i>  I'd ever taken
 pride in being part of the Neptune Army.</font>

224
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But the only reason I worked for you as a soldier was to gain combat experience.  That's all.</font>

225
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You wretch!</font>

226
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It worked.  I've become strong.</font>

227
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

228
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like you bothered to
watch over every part of Fishman Island.</font>

229
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since I was a kid,</font>

230
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen fishmen being oppressed by humans.</font>

231
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>You guys make me want to puke!</i></font>

232
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>No matter how many of you we take out,</i></font>

233
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>you pathetic humans, who can't even
breathe underwater, just keep coming back at us!</i></font>

234
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I looked up to Arlong's ambition, to knock those humans off their pedestals and teach them a lesson!</font>

235
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We are the ones who will continue his plan...</font>

236
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The New Fishman Pirates!</font>

237
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since Arlong went to East Blue
to conquer the world,</font>

238
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've been training so that
I could become his right-hand man.</font>

239
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it never happened,
due to a certain group of humans.</font>

240
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are these fishmen trying to carry out Arlong's plan?!</font>

241
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  Arlong?!</font>

242
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just kidding.
In fact, I've never eaten any Arlong before.</font>

243
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That hurt!  Usopp-san, why did you kick me?</font>

244
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enough talking.  Let's get down to business.</font>

245
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my way!</font>

246
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What?</font>

247
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Rough Shark</i></font>

248
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What insane power!  What is he doing?!</font>

249
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad!  This is so very, very bad!</font>

250
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-chin?</font>

251
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie, I have a favor to ask.</font>

252
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's his natural strength, right?</font>

253
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  He hasn't taken any Energy Steroids yet.</font>

254
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He crushed the wall!</font>

255
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn it!  The palace will be flooded again!</font>

256
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible!  Especially for me!</font>

257
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,190

258
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, water drops!</font>

259
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get back!  He's about to use it!</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The water drops turned into arrows!</font>

262
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You filth!  Attacking my men at random!</font>

263
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cease this, you fool!</font>

264
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!  Don't!</font>

265
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never -jamon!  You are my vassals -jamon!</font>

267
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a fool!  A king shielding his underlings?</font>

268
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really aren't fit to be a king!</font>

269
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

270
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, Hody!</font>

271
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is awful!  They can't even fight back!</font>

272
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy is on a totally different level from Arlong!</font>

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-No!  Wait, Boss Hody!  Don't-</font>

274
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He used his companion as a shield!  He's the worst!</font>

275
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys.  Untie the soldiers.</font>

276
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our negotiations with this country have broken down.</font>

277
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We promised to return all the hostages unharmed, but we couldn't keep that promise.</font>

278
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How dutiful.</font>

279
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, I got it.</font>

280
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no, my foot!</font>

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My strength is fading!  Help me, Nami-san!</font>

282
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Where is Nami-san?</font>

283
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Nami?</font>

284
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where'd they go?  Caimie isn't here either.</font>

285
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jeez... First Luffy disappears, and now Nami?</font>

286
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But freeing these guys is more important right now.</font>

287
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang on for just a little longer, Brook!</font>

288
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is such a strain on my bones.</font>

289
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, hurry and escape.</font>

290
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I leave the task of untying the rest to you.
I have no strength left.</font>

291
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Untie them!  Pick up your weapons!</font>

292
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let them pull any stupid tricks!</font>

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crush the Neptune Army and the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

294
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A surface flower blossomed!</font>

295
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've never seen that flower before!</font>

296
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this.</font>

297
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this smell?!</font>

298
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fools.  How ridiculous.</font>

299
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't take it any more.</font>

300
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!  This place is about to be flooded!</font>

301
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, let those two escape from the castle!</font>

302
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What about you?</font>

303
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If he comes after you,
nobody will be able to get away!</font>

304
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't get in my way.  This country will be mine.</font>

305
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang in there!  You'll be alright!</font>

306
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to get off the island!</font>

307
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This isn't the time for you to worry about us!</font>

308
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just focus on your own injuries right now.</font>

309
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you guys?</font>

310
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Return the mermaids!</font>

311
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn humans, you only see us as mere objects!</font>

312
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What are you talking about?</font>

313
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't play dumb, pirates!</font>

314
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Three young mermaids disappeared
from the southern coast not too long ago!</font>

315
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are the girls?!</font>

316
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't get it.</font>

317
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why do you think we're the culprits?!</font>

318
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granted...</font>

319
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I love mermaids so much
that I really want to kidnap a few...</i></font>

320
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I would never actually do it!</font>

321
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">See?!  He just said he wanted to kidnap them!</font>

322
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you say that to them?!  Be quiet!</font>

323
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be the humans' doing!</font>

324
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of here!</font>

325
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's still some left in this!  Don't waste it!</font>

326
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence, human!</font>

327
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  Sanji, Chopper!</font>

328
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Sanji!  You've recovered from your nosebleed?</font>

329
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy, is that you?</font>

330
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with the puffer fish?</font>

331
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Are they your friends, Luffy-sama?</font>

332
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're my crewmates!</font>

333
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those people are...</font>

334
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look!  Their captain is here!</font>

335
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That damn Straw Hat!
He's the leader of the mermaid kidnappers!</font>

336
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mustn't be seen!
Megalo, close your mouth a little more!</font>

337
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going down there for a bit.</font>

338
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

339
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He jumped down!</font>

340
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hachi!  Is it really you?</font>

341
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat.</font>

342
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to you?!</font>

343
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who did this to you?!</font>

344
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well... He won't say.</font>

345
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to... leave the island.</font>

346
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He keeps insisting we do that.</font>

347
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I thought Straw Hat
was holding Ryuuguu Palace under siege?</font>

348
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're mermaid kidnappers!</font>

349
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must have left his underlings at the castle,
and come to kidnap more!</font>

350
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His ultimate goal must be to kidnap Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

351
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's ridiculous.  There's no way he could do that.</font>

352
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The princess is a giant Big Kiss Mermaid.</font>

353
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not to mention, she's the
only daughter of Sea God Neptune.</font>

354
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if he wanted to kidnap her,
who would be crazy enough to try?</font>

355
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's with that puffer fish?</font>

356
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

357
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Whaaaaat?!</i></font>

358
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:04,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

359
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Princess Shirahoshi?!</i></font>

360
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Uh... Well... Um...</font>

361
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You found me!</font>

362
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's huge!  By "Princess", do they mean...</font>

363
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mermaid Princess?!</font>

364
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  What is it?</font>

365
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is there somebody behind me?</font>

366
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it, Sanji!
Whatever you do, don't turn around!</font>

367
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you talking about?</font>

368
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you turn around, you'll die, Sanji!</font>

369
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aw, man...</font>

370
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>The Mermaid Princess has been kidnapped!</i></font>

371
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

372
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:17,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She... really has been... kidnapped!</font>

373
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  Wimp!
Why'd you get out of the shark?</font>

374
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I'm sorry!</font>

375
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-sama, please don't be so angry with me.</font>

376
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That bastard made the Princess cry!
He really is just pirate scum!</font>

377
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our poor Princess Shirahoshi!</font>

378
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess?</font>

379
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a second... Princess.</font>

380
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They can't mean...</font>

381
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't do it, Sanji!</font>

382
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You absolutely must not turn around!</font>

383
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait...</font>

384
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean to tell me
that if I turn around and look behind me...</font>

385
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">then the Mermaid Princess will be there?</font>

386
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  She's here!</font>

387
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why you absolutely
must not turn around, Sanji!</font>

388
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You nearly died from seeing regular mermaids. { def: to be fair, it was a face full of mermaid boob that did it }</font>

389
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So if you see the Mermaid Princess...</font>

390
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you'll definitely lose
every last drop of blood in your body.</font>

391
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be the end of the line for you!</font>

392
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Mermaid Princess.
The most beautiful woman in the world.</font>

393
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's said that even the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock fails to compare.</font>

394
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The woman who is held above all other Mermaids...</font>

395
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is behind me right now?</font>

396
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Just forget about her!
I'm begging you... Please don't look behind you!</i></font>

397
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Chopper.</font>

398
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Instead of continuing to live without ever
fulfilling the dream that's within my grasp...</font>

399
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I choose to fulfill that dream...</font>

400
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and die!</font>

401
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>What?!</i>  Isn't your dream supposed to be All Blue?!</font>

402
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Stop!</i></font>

403
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Sanji!</i></font>

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  T-T-This...</font>

405
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even my dreams were wretched, when compared to this. {Gil : Line seems to go on past the keyframe. Timing check?}</font>

406
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:55,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This paragon of elegance.  She truly is...</font>

407
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the embodiment of absolute beauty.</font>

408
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He turned to stone!</font>

409
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought he'd bleed to death from a nosebleed.</font>

410
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Petrification?  That's a new symptom.</font>

411
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Maybe it's a side effect
of the Okama blood transfusion?</font>

412
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How can I explain?  Luffy-sama was only...</font>

413
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you okay?!</font>

414
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You gotta tell me, who the hell did this to you?</font>

415
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are you guys doing?</font>

416
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got 'em!</font>

417
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We got the Straw Hat Pirates!</font>

418
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're fishermen!
We risk our lives every day, fighting the Sea Kings!</font>

419
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates are like nothing!</font>

420
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't try and pick a fight
with the Fishman Island fishermen!</font>

421
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fishermen nabbed 'em!</font>

422
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good job!</font>

423
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys are fishermen?  We aren't fish, you know!</font>

424
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  I remember you now!</font>

425
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Long ago you were with Arlong, weren't you?  You're a traitor!</font>

426
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll be fine now, Princess!</font>

427
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll hand 'em over to the Ammo Knights, and then it'll be off with their heads!</font>

428
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... that isn't exactly what happened...
You see, Luffy-sama was just...</font>

429
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!  You guys!  Something's flying this way!</font>

430
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there!</font>

431
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!  Don't say such dumb things!
You can't fool us!</font>

432
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over there!  Hey!</font>

433
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There really is something flying this way!</font>

434
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

435
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't mean...</font>

436
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Vander Decken!</i></font>

437
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've found you, I presume!</font>

438
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shirahoshi!</i></font>

439
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vander Decken-sama.</font>

440
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After hiding for so long,
he's finally showed himself on the island!</font>

441
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess!  Please escape!  We'll hold him here!</font>

442
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me your answer, Shirahoshi!</font>

443
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If it's yes, then you don't have to die!</font>

444
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shall we...</font>

445
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">get married?!</font>

446
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean to tell me that the man who's been throwing weapons at the Princess for the past ten years...</font>

447
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">was just stalking her with marriage proposals?!</font>

448
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a limit to how crazy you can be,
Vander Decken!</font>

449
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because of you, the Princess has spent the last
ten years scared out of her mind, fearing for her life!</font>

450
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe that you'd...</font>

451
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Give me your answer!  Shirahoshi!</font>

452
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It'll be a yes, I presume!</font>

453
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you see...</font>

454
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?  Is it a yes?</font>

455
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just not my type.</font>

456
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

457
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!  That's her reason?!</font>

458
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why you...</font>

459
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been leading me on for ten years!  Who the hell are you planning to marry?!</font>

460
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you aren't going to be mine,
then it hurts me just seeing you alive!</font>

461
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Die, Shirahoshi!</font>

462
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, Princess Shirahoshi, we beg you to escape!</font>

463
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly!  Even if we have to sacrifice our lives...</font>

464
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't run away!  Stay there, Wimp!</font>

465
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you saying?!  As if she'd trust a pirate!</font>

466
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right, you're working with Decken, aren't you? {lit. an accomplice of}</font>

467
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you think you can just order the Princess to die?</font>

468
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"></font>

469
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're too far from me,
I won't be able to protect you!</font>

470
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes!  I'll stay right here!</font>

471
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess!</font>

472
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You really think you can
threaten the Princess like that?!</font>

473
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You pirate scum!</font>

474
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry guys, this is nothing personal, but...</font>

475
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you're in the way!</font>

476
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy!</font>

477
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can do that even when he's tied up?!</font>

478
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is between me and my beloved Shirahoshi.  Why must you get in the way?</font>

479
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be the one who took her...</font>

480
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're the one?!</font>

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one who threw all that stuff at Wimp!</font>

482
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:58,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll take both of your lives then!
I'll put the two of you together and cut you into four!</font>

483
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just try it!</font>

484
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Let me go!</font>

485
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:37,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He... took out Vander Decken?!</font>

486
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still moving.  Now's our chance to capture him!</font>

487
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shark!  Wake up!</font>

488
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji!</font>

489
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you okay?</font>

490
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He turned into stone a little while ago, but it looks like
he's in a state of bliss now.  He's conscious.</font>

491
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.  Got it!</font>

492
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mermaid Princess.</font>

493
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this heaven?  Is it paradise?</font>

494
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dream's been realized.  I can die a happy man.</font>

495
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But wasn't your dream supposed to be All Blue?</font>

496
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, Wimp!</font>

497
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-O-Okay!</font>

498
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:32,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">B-B-But... if it wouldn't trouble you too much,
could you perhaps not raise your voice so much?</font>

499
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's making me really anxious.</font>

500
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know why, but it seems like
we're no longer welcome on this island.</font>

501
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We should get out of here soon.</font>

502
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thanks, Wimp!</font>

503
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're outta here!</font>

504
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">O-Okay!</font>

505
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Princess!  Why did you undo the rope?</font>

506
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That pirate scum... he's threatening her again!</font>

507
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm terribly sorry, everyone.
But I'll be back in time for dinner!</font>

508
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

509
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shark forward!</font>

510
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of the way, trash!</font>

511
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't lettin' you get away that easily!</font>

512
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wadatsumi!</font>

513
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've seen him before.</font>

514
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the Umibouzu that attacked the Sunny!  He's one of Decken's underlings!</font>

515
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Great Monk!</font>

516
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wadatsumi!</font>

517
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Knock them out of the sky!</font>

518
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You got it!</font>

00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:21,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My tooth!  My front tooth!  It broke!</font>

520
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Owie!  Owie!</font>

521
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That oversized brat!</font>

522
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright!</font>

523
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're off, Wimp!</font>

524
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sea Forest!</font>

525
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

526
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:46,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Hody!  Two females, a pirate and a mermaid,
have escaped from Ryuuguu Palace!</font>

527
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let them go.</font>

528
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nami-chin, is this really okay?
Leaving Zoro-chin and the others like that...</font>

529
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not like you could carry everyone.</font>

530
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, that's true, but...</font>

531
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry about it!</font>

532
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Worrying won't do any good!</font>

533
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know that everyone's strong, but...</font>

534
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:12,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You see, Hody's not just strong.
His ideas are dangerous too, or so Hacchin says.</font>

535
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know, in the past two years,
we've all gotten way stronger than we were before.</font>

536
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But more importantly,
what kind of person is the former Shichibukai Jinbe?</font>

537
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

538
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, Boss Jinbe... He's a pirate, but,</font>

539
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">he's so popular that he used to come and go
from Ryuuguu Palace as he pleased.</font>

540
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.  But he was in
the same crew as Arlong, wasn't he?</font>

541
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hody said that he's going to
pick up where Arlong left off.</font>

542
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Jinbe left a message for Luffy: "Don't fight Hody."</font>

543
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I understand what he meant.</font>

544
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?  You don't think that
he just meant that it would be dangerous?</font>

545
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I just hope Zoro and the others don't anger Hody so much that we get dragged even further into this mess.</font>

546
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At any rate, I wanna see Jinbe.</font>

547
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said "I will be waiting for you in the Sea Forest."</font>

548
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This incident is going to have
a profound impact on the kingdom.</font>

549
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's even a chance that there will be riots so huge that they shake the kingdom to its core.</font>

550
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think he knew all of this.</font>

551
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boss Jinbe knew that?</font>

552
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Caimie.</font>

553
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take me to the Sea Forest!</font>

554
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

555
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All men, listen up!</font>

556
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir!  We shall immediately remove
Hody and his crew from the premises. {they just say, "and that crew." It's ambiguous as to which crew they mean, but I think they mean Hody's.}</font>

557
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's no good -jamon!</font>

558
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?!</font>

559
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I cannot fight properly.</font>

560
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As it stands now, you would all just die in vain.</font>

561
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shall surrender the palace to them at once.</font>

562
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will join up with Fukaboshi,
and then come up with a plan to recapture the palace.</font>

563
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surrender the palace?!
Are you serious, Neptune-sama?</font>

564
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Zoro... What do you think you can do
against a Fishman in the water?!</font>

565
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:12,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp-san, my power's fading.
It feels like I'm gonna drown and die at any moment.</font>

566
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're already dead.</font>

567
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed.</font>

568
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro!</font>

569
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:56,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Ryuuguu palace falls into Hody's hands.</font>

570
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Meanwhile, Jinbe tells everyone about him and Arlong,</font>

571
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">while parts of Fishman Island fall into chaos.</font>

572
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Next time on One Pace:</font>
