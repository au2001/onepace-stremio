<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The sin of your grandpa that took my fortune away!</font>

133
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He also took away my power and the sweet memories of my younger days!</font>

134
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I said before, I don't know what you're talking about! Talk to my grandpa!</font>

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Death is too good a punishment for Garp!</font>

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He must live on with the pain of losing what's dear to him!</font>

137
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I guess I have no choice.</font>

138
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's do it.</font>

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Regardless of your grudge,
I can't win unless I beat you.</font>

140
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's settle this right here!</font>

141
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're in the way!</font>

142
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move!</font>

143
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The disposition of a king.</font>

144
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Clash of the Color of Conquerors.</font>

145
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-C Block!</font>

146
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are only...</font>

147
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">two men left!</font>

148
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like all these famous, tough warriors have been knocked out by {Halee: Removed the ellipsis at the end since the next line seems to begin immediately afterwards. If not, restore it.}</font>

149
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the impact from the epic clash of those two men and have been taken out of the fight!</font>

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what did we <i>actually</i> see?!</font>

151
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't know you could use the Color of the Conqueror!</font>

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of king are you dreaming of becoming?!</font>

153
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate King!</font>

154
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How laughable!</font>

155
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are so many in the New World who can use that power!</font>

156
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And only a battle between you all will determine the winner!</font>

157
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The strongest among a legion of "Conquerors"!</font>

158
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's who the Pirate King is!</font>

159
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who taught you how to use that Haki?</font>

160
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rayleigh!</font>

161
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's still kicking?!</font>

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How annoying!</font>

163
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't even want to think about what happened in the past!</font>

164
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

165
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaaat?!</font>

166
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me, Straw Hat.</font>

167
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to forget but it's always right there in front of me!</font>

168
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But it's out of my reach! My treasure!</font>

169
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can you imagine anything more painful than that?!</font>

170
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?! The legendary pirate is...</font>

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">crying!</font>

172
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandpa...</font>

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought the plan was to let big brother advance to the final! {Halee: Maybe "the big brother"?}</font>

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm still not strong enough.</font>

175
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody can stop him once he's at it!</font>

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Chinjao the Drill."</font>

177
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's what they used to call me, but not anymore.</font>

178
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me!</font>

179
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know what Garp has done to me?!</font>

180
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you that I don't know!</font>

181
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go Lucy! Now's the chance!</font>

182
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Luffy-dono!</font>

183
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:27,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sanji-dono, I want to get to the Toy House to rescue Kanjurou already!</font>

184
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanna help you with that but you have to wait.</font>

185
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have an urgent situation here.</font>

186
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look how many Marines there are around the Colosseum.</font>

187
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are there so many?</font>

188
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like pirates and criminals are freely entering this competition.</font>

189
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Marines are here to catch them as they come out.</font>

190
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, criminals should be caught.</font>

191
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't forget that you were on our pirate ship!</font>

192
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to get word to Luffy about this,</font>

193
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but the entrance for the competitors is completely closed off.</font>

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on here-dara?</font>

195
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has no one come out from the Colosseum yet-dara?</font>

196
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, sir. Not yet.</font>

197
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There must be hundreds of losers from A-Block and B-Block-dara!</font>

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why hasn't even a single one of them come out-dara?</font>

199
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's strange.</font>

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><font size="54">Vice Admiral Maynard went undercover as a competitor</font></font>

201
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:37,500

Shark Cutter Bastille</font>

202
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but we haven't had any contact with him for a while.</font>

203
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did he do that on his own?</font>

204
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That punk!</font>

205
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is something going on...</font>

206
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in the Colosseum-dara?</font>

207
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here in Dressrosa, there are two laws...</font>

208
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that people must obey strictly...</font>

209
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since Doflamingo ascended to the throne 10 years ago.</font>

210
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First, curfew is at midnight on the dot.</font>

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Citizens must not go out after that.</font>

212
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! Even adults?!</font>

213
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Humans have to go back to their homes</font>

214
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and toys have to go back to their toy houses.</font>

215
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one's allowed to go out after midnight.</font>

216
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't even go for a drink!</font>

217
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everything is closed anyway.</font>

218
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Second,</font>

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">toys must not enter human's houses</font>

220
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and humans must not enter toy's houses!</font>

221
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

222
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like they're friendly with each other</font>

223
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but that's prohibited?!</font>

224
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But if that's the sad boundary between artifacts and living things, it can't be helped.</font>

225
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, come to think of it, I'm kind of getting used to it already but...</font>

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">what kind of toys are you guys?</font>

227
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have free will and you can talk.</font>

228
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whoever made you all must be a genius like Vegapunk.</font>

229
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who was it?</font>

230
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Somebody, call the police!</font>

231
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?!</font>

232
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please! Let go of me!</font>

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Esta, it's me!</font>

234
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The toy's broken! It's got "human disorder"!</font>

235
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to me! It's not that!</font>

236
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you remember, Esta?!</font>

237
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's me!</font>

238
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from me! You're freaking me out!</font>

239
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened all of a sudden?!</font>

240
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've been friendly with her until now!</font>

241
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please! Try to remember!</font>

242
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away from her!</font>

243
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come with us!</font>

244
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

245
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Esta! I'm your boyfriend!</font>

246
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't hook up with that bastard!</font>

247
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please remember me!</font>

248
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let go of me! Dammit!</font>

249
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calm down!</font>

250
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop!</font>

251
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Stop!</font>

252
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Let go of me, you bastards!</font>

253
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a human!</font>

254
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me ride you, Onepoko!</font>

255
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No-wan! You're too heavy now-wan!</font>

256
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Onepoko!</font>

257
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm not heavy! Onepoko!</font>

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me go talk to him.</font>

259
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. He's a toy, too.</font>

260
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, yeah, a half of me is.</font>

261
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm, Onepoko's got it!</font>

262
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who are you?</font>

263
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm that boy's father. And that woman is my wife.</font>

264
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Milo, not Onepoko.</font>

265
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey boy, don't you have a daddy?</font>

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? No, I don't!</font>

267
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you have a husband?</font>

268
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I don't. I'm not married.</font>

269
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not so unusual, is it?</font>

270
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bye bye!</font>

271
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey soldier, what do you want to show me? What's going on here?</font>

272
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What I wanted to show you is...</font>

273
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... this country is filled with both the forgotten</font>

274
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and those who have forgotten them!</font>

275
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All of us toys were once humans!</font>

276
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

277
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Devil Fruit user who Doflamingo brought 10 years ago, {Halee: Maybe ellipsis instead of comma?}</font>

278
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">turned us all into toys!</font>

279
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! That means you were...</font>

280
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There!</font>

281
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see the Flower Field! I'll tell you everything there!</font>

282
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,300
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Green Bit</font>

283
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have no mercy!</font>

284
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm all thumbs so...</font>

285
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is she not picking up?! Nami-ya!</font>

286
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm calling the right number!</font>

287
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,380
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Underneath Green Bit
Tontatta Kingdom</font>

288
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}It's Usoland's Haki!</font>

289
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Without tension rods the shelf will fall over.</font>

290
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo, are you ready to go? Do you need lunch?</font>

291
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandma, I'm sure there will be something to eat at headquarters.</font>

292
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah?</font>

293
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Grandma!</font>

294
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know, I'm gonna sew up everything that might fall over!</font>

295
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, now it's safe!</font>

296
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe how powerful the hero is!</font>

297
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He can shake up the whole kingdom with the thing called Haki!</font>

298
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!</font>

299
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because Usoland is the legendary hero!</font>

300
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Leo, I won't fall over even though I look weak.</font>

301
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tontatta Kingdom, huh?</font>

302
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What kind of relationship do they have with the Warlord Doflamingo?</font>

303
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever it is, they're serious about fighting him.</font>

304
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Usoland and Robiland, have you eaten enough?</font>

305
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, I'm totally stuffed...</font>

306
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, I had enough and I'm ready to go!</font>

307
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look, my body is trembling with excitement and making the ground shake!</font>

308
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How awesome!</font>

309
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's unbelievable!</font>

310
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, Leo, you people keep saying "fight" but...</font>

311
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... why do you wanna fight Doflamingo?</font>

312
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

313
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The hero's very funny!</font>

314
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We want to rescue our 500 friends who are being forced</font>

315
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to work at the dark factory, of course!</font>

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?! A factory?!</font>

317
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the one that Luffy and the others went to destroy?!</font>

318
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that the one that's manufacturing SMILEs?</font>

319
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what they are making there,</font>

320
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but they also have the Tontatta Tribe's...</font>

321
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... obnoxious, selfish, mean, moody, short-tempered Princess Mancherie, too.</font>

322
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So we have to get going!</font>

323
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you think you would be better off not rescuing her?</font>

324
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, but...</font>

325
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">... she's one of us too!</font>

326
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Noland would save everybody who's in trouble, wouldn't he?</font>

327
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

328
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yeah, he would! That's what a true hero does!</font>

329
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since I'm his descendant, I'd do the same, of course!</font>

330
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's our legendary hero!</font>

331
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo!</font>

332
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flapper!</font>

333
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leo, I just heard the Donquixote Family at the palace is on the move!</font>

334
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're probably heading to the basement of the Colosseum!</font>

335
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kabu-san's Yellow Cub and Bian's Pink Bee</font>

336
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are ready to take off anytime!</font>

337
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

338
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's go! Usoland! Robiland!</font>

339
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The battle will take place in Dressrosa!</font>

340
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Underneath the Colosseum!</font>

341
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the dark factory!</font>

342
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everybody, let's go!</font>

343
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah!</font>
