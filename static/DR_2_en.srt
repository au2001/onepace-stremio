00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The event today...</font>

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will be a truly special occasion!</font>

133
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For this day, the King has granted us...</font>

134
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a priceless gem!</font>

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Two years ago, at the Great War at Marineford...</font>

136
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a man lost his life.</font>

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was second commander of the legendary Whitebeard Pirates, and the son of the Pirate King.</font>

138
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace!</font>

139
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say his fists of flame could pierce warships...</font>

140
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or burn cities to the ground
and turn them into a living hell!</font>

141
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This formidable power has returned to the world.
Reborn in the form of a new Devil Fruit!</font>

142
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">R-Reborn?</font>

143
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Seriously?!</font>

144
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Behold!</font>

145
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This forbidden fruit
will be given to the victor of today's battle!</font>

146
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One of the Logia Devil Fruits,
the strongest of the three varieties!</font>

147
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Flame Fruit!</font>

148
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is that true?</font>

149
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The young master
would never lie about something like this!</font>

150
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ace's...</font>

151
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Flame Fruit?</font>

152
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today our colosseum will be host to...</font>

153
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">great men from all parts of the New World
who have been summoned by our King.</font>

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However!  This gem will not be handed over easily.</font>

155
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If anyone thinks they can steal it,
I'd like to see them try!</font>

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is being guarded by people far more powerful
than our usual combatants.</font>

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Namely...</font>

158
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">members of the esteemed Donquixote Family!</font>

159
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Senor Pink!</font>

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dellinger!</font>

161
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Lao G!</font>

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Machvise!</font>

163
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Vise!</font>

164
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And last but not least, the hero of our colosseum...</font>

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mr. Diamante!</font>

166
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diamante-sama!</font>

167
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Diamante!</font>

168
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's get this thing started!</font>

169
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's see some blood!</font>

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... is Ace's Flame Fruit doing here?</font>

171
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Each devil fruit is unique
and no two have the same power.</font>

172
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when a devil fruit user dies,</font>

173
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the fruit that holds that power will reappear again somewhere in the world.</font>

174
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And whoever eats the new fruit
will become the next holder of its power.</font>

175
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After Fire Fist Ace died,
the Flame Fruit reappeared somewhere unnoticed.</font>

176
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until the young master managed to find it!</font>

177
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's giving away a Logia devil fruit as a prize for his business.</font>

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The young master is much more generous than he needs to be.</font>

179
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure my life would be changed if I could gain that amazing power.</font>

180
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like hell I'd let you eat it!</font>

181
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, Ace was your...</font>

182
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want that Flame Fruit!</font>

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I know!  Why don't you eat it, Franky?</font>

184
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd rather not become an anchor. { def: dude, you're like 60% metal already.  how much swimming are you doing? }</font>

185
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've already eaten the Rubber Fruit,
so I can't eat another one...</font>

186
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but I don't want some random stranger to run off with Ace's power!</font>

187
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's like a memento for you?</font>

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thinking of what Doflamingo said,
this is probably a trap.</font>

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All I'll say is...</font>

190
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let this chance slip away!</font>

191
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'd just end up regretting it.</font>

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, we've got business at the colosseum anyway.</font>

193
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So let's go.</font>

194
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You fools.</font>

195
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If wanting it was all it took,
nobody would lose their lives there.</font>

196
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You underestimate the danger of the colosseum.</font>

197
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,290
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Mysterious Fairy Pursuit</font>

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fairy, my ass!  He's just some thief!</font>

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I keep telling you to wait!</font>

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Surely you can lose a sword.  Or two!</font>

201
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like hell I can, you damned idiot!</font>

202
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! Where did he go?</font>

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

204
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you find the fairy?</font>

205
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,390
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dancer
Violet</font>

206
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such sweetness!</font>

207
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Such passion!</font>

208
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one in the world can match your dancing! {Xemnas: No one in the world can match the laziness of that animation.}</font>

209
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

210
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sh-</font>

211
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's so beautiful!</font>

212
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you forgotten
that women in this country stab men to death?</font>

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just gonna wind up dead.</font>

214
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'd gladly let her stab me!</i></font>

215
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shit!  I lost sight of him!</font>

216
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That Moss-Head got himself lost!</font>

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, this is an excellent opportunity.</font>

218
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's just leave him here.
He's nothing but trouble anyway.</font>

219
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I did everything I could.</font>

220
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Looks like this place is filled with couples.
I'm really jealous.</font>

221
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wonder if this place would make
Nami-san and Robin-chan hopelessly fall for me?</font>

222
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hello, you there!</font>

223
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the one who was looking at me earlier, right?</font>

224
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please...</font>

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">hold me in your arms!</font>

226
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whaaat?!</font>

227
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did she run off to?</font>

228
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must have snuck out the back door into Lovers' Avenue.  She can't be far!{Good thing they aren't just doing a full 360 around on their immediate surroundings. I think they would probably have spotted her. -Starfish}</font>

229
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let her get out of the city!</font>

230
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes sir! { def: does this count as translating?  cause if it does i think i could be a translator } {Xemnas: lol}</font>

231
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.  It looks like they're gone.</font>

232
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Umm...</font>

233
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">you can let go now.</font>

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you are very welcome.</font>

235
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry!  Did you hit your head?</font>

236
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, the only thing that has hit me is the impact of our meeting.</font>

237
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But there's so much blood!{Dear anime-creators everywhere. THAT IS NOT WHERE THE BLOOD GOES WHEN ONE IS TURNED ON. SRSLY. WHERE DID THAT STEREOTYPE EVEN COME FROM. -Starfish} {Xemnas: That's Japan for you. If you ever come across something weird, 99% of the time it originated in Japan.}</font>

238
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... it's nothing.</font>

239
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Poor you.</font>

240
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no use!  I cannot resist this passion!</font>

241
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you mustn't look at me like that!</font>

242
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have forsaken love.</font>

243
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Every man I've gotten involved with-</font>

244
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know!</font>

245
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were all in paradise!</font>

246
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were being chased, right?  Who were those people?</font>

247
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there's anything I can do to help, just tell me!</font>

248
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was the police.</font>

249
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I... stabbed a man to death...</font>

250
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">because our love had turned sour.</font>

251
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

252
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mean it's true?!  Women in this country really <i>are</i> passionate enough to kill?!</font>

253
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

254
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're okay with that?!</font>

255
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

256
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, you can't just forgive a demonic woman like me!</font>

257
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or I might...</font>

258
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">fall in love with you.</font>

259
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My name is Violet.</font>

260
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you be so kind

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And once there...</font>

262
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,630

265
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just listen to those cheers!
Suddenly, I wanna participate too.</font>

266
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're really getting fired up.</font>

267
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've caused so much trouble!</font>

268
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just give up already!</font>

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Criminal toy soldier!</font>

270
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,440

276
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cops and marines
are forbidden to enter the colosseum!</font>

277
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if you see criminals within the colosseum, you have no authority here!</font>

278
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only law that applies in here
is the law of the Donquixote Family!</font>

279
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pull those triggers, and <i>you</i> will be the criminals!</font>

280
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now get out of my sight!</font>

281
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit.</font>

282
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, pardon me old man!
Shall I carry your luggage for you?</font>

283
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?  He sure got real polite all of a sudden.</font>

284
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a funny soldier!</font>

285
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You find me funny?</font>

286
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about this?  How about this?</font>

287
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could you step aside, pops?</font>

288
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, am I in your way?  How terribly rude of me!</font>

289
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're blushing like crazy!</font>

290
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're really serious, huh?</font>

291
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">N-Not at all!</font>

292
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Making people smile is a toy's duty!</font>

293
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As if there could ever be such a thing as a serious toy!</font>

294
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's taking it personally!{...I will admit, I am not sure I fully understand this conversation =/ -Starfish}</font>

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The open sign-up for today's battle
is about to close.</font>

296
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not that any commoners
would want to participate, anyway.</font>

297
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're too scared.</font>

298
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Luffy.  Looks like that's your entrance over there.</font>

299
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I see.</font>

300
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright, I'm participating!  Sign me up!</font>

301
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,550

302
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh? Does that old man want to enter?</font>

303
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is he nuts?</font>

304
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does he have any idea what he's doing?!</font>

305
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Luffy, listen. Promise me just one thing.</font>

306
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can go all out if you want but don't ever let them know who you are.</font>

307
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

308
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,980

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the dressing room for the competitors.</font>

313
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're free until we call you.</font>

314
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wow! It's so exciting!</font>

316
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, it's mine, idiot!</font>

317
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, who's the little guy?</font>

318
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

319
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can we use any weapons we like?</font>

320
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, who is he?</font>

321
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, he's the last participant to sign up.</font>

322
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this shrimp doing here?</font>

323
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}This is the worst kind of joke!</font>

326
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't, Spartan!</font>

327
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's no fun seeing a weakling get pummeled!</font>

328
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The spectators only get excited when the strong go head-to-head!</font>

329
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is not a place for you! Go home!</font>

330
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go home now!</font>
