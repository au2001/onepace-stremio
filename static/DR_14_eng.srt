00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She did it!</font>

132
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Actually, come to think of it, it's really hard to see here.</font>

133
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cheer her on from somewhere closer.</font>

134
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay.</font>

135
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh yeah, I used to think
this country looked really fun and happy...</font>

136
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but looking at you guys, maybe I was wrong.</font>

137
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What you saw was the flowery world of the winners.</font>

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo divides the world
into obedient winners and disobedient losers.</font>

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's exactly like the World Government.</font>

140
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those who oppose him
are losers who get treated like garbage.</font>

141
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hide the garbage in darkness, and sure,
the country ends up looking perfect from the outside.</font>

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you start questioning things,
you see that something is wrong in this country.</font>

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You better be careful.</font>

147
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright. See ya.</font>

151
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}searching for resources that their country didn't possess.</font>

152
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when they were discovered by the big humans, they were brought to the brink of extinction.</font>

155
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But one day, the king of Dressrosa,
a neighbouring country, offered them a deal.</font>

156
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:40,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In exchange for a bit of manual labor, he would offer them the resources they desired and their safety.</font>

157
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The name of that king was Donquixote.</font>

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:54,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the worst part of our history, which continued until 900 years ago.</font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Demons, through and through!</font>

162
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our people were forced to work day in and day out, deep underground where no one could see them.</font>

163
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:23,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The big humans lived on the riches and prosperity brought by the Tontatta.</font>

165
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">800 years ago, a new king was born into Dressrosa.</font>

166
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>King Riku!</i></font>

167
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:56,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After hearing of the dwarves' inhumane treatment for the past few hundred years,</font>

168
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it is told that he shed tears and deeply apologized from the bottom of his heart.</font>

169
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And the next action of the
new king was one of repentance.</font>

170
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He said that we could take anything we needed from this country.</font>

171
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That we didn't need to work.</font>

172
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The king called it the work of fairies and calmed the citizens with laughter.</font>

173
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He successfully created the legend of the fairies in this country.</font>

174
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku the First, you're so cool!</font>

175
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:50,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The country led by the kind Riku line even provided support for neighbouring countries in danger.</font>

176
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't say the country was wealthy and prosperous,</font>

177
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but it was a wonderful one full of smiles.</font>

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our ancestors paid tribute to the kind King Riku,</font>

179
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:10,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by turning this country into one of beautiful fields and flowers.</font>

180
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is the 800 year long bond between our Tontatta Kingdom and the Riku royal family.</font>

181
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:29,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But after 900 years, the descendant of the Donquixote family, Doflamingo returned.</font>

182
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Strangely enough, he is trying to replay our horrible history.</font>

183
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:45,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over 500 of our people, including my daughter Mansherry have fallen prey to his sinister ways.</font>

184
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We mustn't let those times repeat themselves!</font>

185
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We won't let it.</font>

186
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll fight!</font>

187
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed, to Dressrosa, and to the Tontatta,</font>

188
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the Donquixote Family's rule
will only bring suffering!</font>

189
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll fight alongside our hero!</font>

190
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With Usoland on our side, we can't lose. {Xemnas: Went a bit liberal here.}</font>

191
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:21,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!</i></font>

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was thinking the same thing!</font>

193
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As expected!</font>

194
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku was such a good guy.</font>

195
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He was nice to the bug people.</font>

196
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Who are you calling bugs?!</i></font>

197
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I meant it in a good way.</font>

198
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Then it's okay!</i></font>

199
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Captain-san.</font>

200

202
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and is really being insulted.</font>

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">You're the shame of Dressrosa! {Xemnas: Same as previous line}</font>

204
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people of this country seem to hate King Riku.</font>

205
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was thinking the same thing! {Exact same phrasing as thirty seconds ago, for the record. -Starfish}{Isis: it's okay since it's the usual Usopp's funny act}</font>

206
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Yeah!</i></font>

207
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!</i></font>

208
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On that day, 10 years ago...</font>

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6"><i>Usoland!</i></font>

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">an incident happened that caused King Riku to lose the country's trust in one night.{Isis: now it comes back to being that night, can someone clarify this .}</font>

211
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though the king tried to protect the country all the way until the end.</font>

212
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The citizens don't know the truth about that incident!</font>

213
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,290

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At that time, Doflamingo tried to destroy the Riku blood line, but...</font>

215
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:42,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I took King Riku's granddaughter Rebecca and continued to run for a long time.</font>

216
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,560

217
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And now she is put on show at the colosseum.</font>

218
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll gladly lay down my life to protect
 King Riku's integrity and Rebecca's life.</font>

219
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am betting everything on this fight!</font>

220
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just why are you...</font>

221
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't protect Rebecca's mother.</font>

222
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Never for a second have I forgotten what happened on that day.</font>

223
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Having been turned into a toy, she may no longer remember me, but...</font>

224
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am...</font>

225
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca's father!</font>

226

227
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this? Rebecca saw her chance and escaped!</font>

228
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca is scurrying around like a mouse!</font>

229
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:42,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And Rolling Logan is in hot pursuit,
taking down any fighter that gets in his way!</font>

230
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's cheap, Rebecca! Fight!</font>

231
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fight and let us see some blood!</font>

232
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn descendant of King Riku!</font>

233
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your family's pure evil!</font>

234
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're her father...</font>

235
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">doesn't that mean...</font>

236
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">since she's King Riku's granddaughter...</font>

238
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It all began on that night.</font>

239
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Answer me!</font>

240
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must be King Riku's...</font>

241
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, actually it may have started long before that.</font>

242
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the day when that woman, Monet, began working in the palace.</font>

243
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Monet?</font>

244
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The bird-woman from Punk Hazard? {dat memory loss}{Cecil: The way he reacted to seeing her, YESTERDAY, you'd think he's scream his head off right there.}</font>

245
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:48,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This country has changed a lot in the past 10 years.</font>

246
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Both the land and its people. {Cecil: This is my favourite song from dressrosa, I patiently await for some sort of soundtrack to come out with it.}</font>

<font face="impress bt" size="45">Dressrosa 10 Years Ago</font>

248
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what happened?</font>

249
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pirates attacked my house.</font>

250
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though since the Riku Royal Army protects us, the damage wasn't that bad.</font>

251
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It hasn't rained in two weeks.</font>

252
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah. But despite the drought, the flowers haven't wilted.</font>

253
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why?</font>

254
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's all thanks to the fairies.</font>

255
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They protect our flowers.</font>

256
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want more food!</font>

257
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you have enough energy left to shout, then you're fine.</font>

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We may be poor, but this country is free from war.</font>

259
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you think that's more important?</font>

260
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah! {...No seriously, this entire sequence just BOTHERS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. I refuse to believe that it could have been as idyllic as they portray it here. -Starfish}{most unrealistic reaction from a kid that's never experienced anything horribly traumatic like that before.}{Sewil: be more grumpy pls}</font>

261
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In the 800 years under the Riku Royal Family's rule,</font>

262
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">this country has never fought a single war.</font>

263
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's amazing.</font>

264
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Indeed. Miraculous, even.</font>

265
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dressrosa was a truly peaceful country.</font>

266
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But then...</font>

267
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">without warning, a nightmare descended upon the royal palace.</font>

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's there?!</font>

269
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't shout. Don't call for anyone.</font>

270
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-Who are you?</font>

271
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am Donquixote Doflamingo.</font>

272
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The rumors about this pirate Donquixote have caused me some concern.</font>

273
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, your worries were spot-on.</font>

274
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am a descendant of the Donquixote family, the old rulers of this country.</font>

275
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I am the rightful ruler of this kingdom. The king has returned!</font>

276
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">From what I heard, you robbed a transport ship that was carrying tribute for the Celestial Dragons,</font>

277
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and used that money to blackmail the Government into making you a Warlord.</font>

278
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They don't know how to deal with me.</font>

279
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that I don't fear the Celestial Dragons really worries them.</font>

280
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you know who I am and what I can do, that simplifies matters.</font>

281
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll sell you the country for 10,000,000,000 belly.</font>

282
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll <i>sell</i> the country?!</font>

283
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Normally I'd just take it without giving you this chance.</font>

284
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I can use money to avoid bloodshed, then so be it.</font>

285
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this country doesn't even <i>have</i>
10,000,000,000-</font>

286
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course it does.</font>

287
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have until dawn.</font>

288
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No getting help from other countries. I'm testing your power as king.</font>

289
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, you are not to tell your citizens about me.</font>

290
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have two options.</font>

291
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Either avoid a fight by gathering money,</font>

292
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">or fight and see the blood of your subjects.</font>

293
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Choose whichever you prefer.</font>

294
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wouldn't it be better to fight Doflamingo, Your Majesty?</font>

295
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No!</font>

296
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Calling it "fighting" might make it sound nicer, but it would be manslaughter, an inhuman act!</font>

297
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:15,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But even if we try to gather up money, there aren't many rich people in this kingdom.</font>

298
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that Dressrosa has been at peace for 800 years proves that we are not beasts.</font>

299
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't lower yourself to the level of animals! Be human!</font>

300
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not let people kill each other!</font>

301
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have no time!</font>

302
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Send troops to all towns in Dressrosa!</font>

303
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must gather up 10,000,000,000 belly from this country!</font>

304
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we don't, this will become a kingdom ruled by pirates!</font>

305
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sure that gathering the money will mean that I'll lose the people's trust,</font>

306
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but only for a few hours!</font>

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once this is all over, I will do whatever I can to make it up to them!</font>

308
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is all we can do.  We can't solve this through lies or stalling.</font>

309
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep gathering money for as long as you can! The life of this kingdom depends on it!</font>

310
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the army.</font>

311
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What could they want so late at night?</font>

312
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that Commander Tank?</font>

313
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Listen to me, all of you!</font>

314
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want you to gather all the money you have and bring it here!</font>

315
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's wrong?</font>

316
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you really think the king will let you get away with this?</font>

317
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is an order from the king!</font>

318
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Quickly! We can't explain our reasons, nor do we have time to wait!</font>

319
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, just have faith in King Riku and bring whatever money you have here!</font>

320
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this is just so sudden...</font>

321
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is madness! There's no way they'll accept this!</font>

322
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A Projector Snail?</font>

323
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To everyone in Dressrosa.</font>

324
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku!</font>

325
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's King Riku!</font>

326
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have a request. It's rather sudden, and so unreasonable you might doubt your hearing, but...</font>

327
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">please don't ask me why I'm doing this.</font>

328
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please just get whatever money you have...</font>

329
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and lend it all to me! {Xemnas: nuance and all}</font>

330
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The king's bowing down!</font>

331
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty!</font>

332
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But why would he ask this?</font>

333
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just so sudden.</font>

334
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty, why are you bowing down to your people?!</font>

335
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mustn't! You are the king!</font>

336
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop this!</font>

337
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Raise your head!</font>

338
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you're seen acting like this, you'll bring shame to your ancestors!</font>

339
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll become the whole world's laughing-stock!</font>

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop this, now!</font>

341
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I beg of you! This is no joke!</font>

342
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:47,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you want proof of my sincerity, I'll gladly cut off my own hands or feet for you, right now!</font>

343
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Listen close, Tank.</i></font>

344
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Should the worst happen, I will at least try to take Doflamingo down myself.</i></font>

345
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>King Riku, isn't that...</i></font>

346
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I leave the rest to you.</i></font>

347
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must gather that money, whatever it takes!</font>

348
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up, everyone! Get your money, like the king asked you!</font>

349
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right!  The king is kind, he'd never do this for selfish reasons!</font>

350
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, he's gotta have some good reason for this!</font>

351
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bring all your money!</font>

352
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Alright!</i></font>

353
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This proves the king's greatness.</font>

354
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here.</font>

355
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you.</font>

356
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me!</font>

357
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People have wholeheartedly trusted the Riku Royal Family for 800 years.</font>

358
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a magnificent kingdom!</font>

359
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This country will be saved!</font>

360
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will repay you!</font>

361
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now carry the money back to the palace!</font>

362
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry!</font>

363
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Commander Tank!</font>

364
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His Majesty is in the town of Sevio.</font>

365
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at the screen.</font>

366
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?</font>

367
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,780
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Southern Town Sevio</font>

368
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Majesty. You didn't need to come here.</font>

369
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run...</font>

370
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku! We may not know what your reasons are, but we believe in you!</font>

371
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run away! {Why would you have two lines in a row with the same dialogue be translated different ways? O_O}{Xemnas: Well "run, run, run" over and over again gets tedious and the last one is extended.}</font>

372
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku! What are you...</font>

373
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku!</font>

374
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku?!</font>

375
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No! Stop this!</font>

376
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku, please stop!</font>

377
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong with you?</font>

378
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Move! Stay away from me!</font>

379
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get away!</font>

380
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's even killing the soldiers?!{can't the timing be a bit longer}</font>

381
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body's moving on its own!</font>

382
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What... is going on...</font>

383
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku?!</font>

384
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unbelievable!</font>

385
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a horrible king!</font>

386
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The night is still young.</font>

387
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, soldiers! You dance too!</font>

388
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Parasite!</font>

389
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now the soldiers have gone insane too!</font>

390
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Help me!</font>

391
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">C-Commander!</font>

392
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">King Riku, why?!</font>

393
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's never done anything wrong!</font>

394
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it something we did?</font>

395
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is no excuse for this.</font>

396
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The country is done for!</font>

397
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This was Doflamingo's trap!</font>

398
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What has happened to you, Your Majesty!?</font>

399
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, stop!</font>

400
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, hey! Can we start now, Doffy?</font>

401
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be so impatient, you fool.</font>

402
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will wait until the country has been plunged into the very depths of despair,</font>

403
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and they curse King Riku with all their hearts.</font>

404
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is when the heroes will appear!</font>
