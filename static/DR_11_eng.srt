00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really... I just want to relax for a bit.</font>

132
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This way, Lucy.</font>

133
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, it's you! Um...</font>

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's Rebecca.  You sure have a lot of enemies.</font>

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Follow me.</font>

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right, thanks!</font>

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you could say the same about Shiliew.</font>

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I don't trust Aokiji.</font>

139
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, hold on, Captain.</font>

140
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat's here.</font>

141
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, you're there too?</font>

142
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat?</font>

143
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Blackbeard?!</i></font>

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Long time no see, Straw Hat!  </i></font>

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I sure was surprised when I heard that you were Commander Ace's little brother!</i></font>

146
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Shouldn't you be there?</i></font>

147
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>They're gonna start soon, ya know?</i></font>

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Your brother's execution, that is!</i></font>

149
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Blackbeard?</font>

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.  It's been a while, hasn't it? </font>

151
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I understand you're participating in the tournament, "Lucy"?</font>

152
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But my man, Burgess,
is going to win the Flame Fruit!</font>

153
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's almost like Ace is joining my crew.
It's going to be great!</font>

154
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I mean, he did refuse the offer last time! </font>

155
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're the last person I'd let have Ace's power!</font>

156
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I look forward to fighting you!</font>

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You know that pirate?</font>

158
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

159
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't let him win the tournament!</font>

160
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you have any more free samples, lady?</font>

161
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're just going to eat samples
without buying anything, aren't you!</font>

162
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hang on!</font>

163
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm so sorry, Miss.</font>

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want, Lucy?</font>

165
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're gonna buy me food?!</font>

166
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, he's a friend of yours, Rebecca?</font>

167
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you very much.</font>

168
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry, I couldn't afford much.</font>

169
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. Thanks for treating me, Rebecca.</font>

170
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So, where are we?</font>

171
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is the dormitory for the colosseum gladiators.</font>

172
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though some people would call it a prison.</font>

173
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guest competitors never come down here, so you can relax here until the finals.</font>

174
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really?  That's great!</font>

175
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,810
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Gladiator Exclusive to the Corrida Colosseum
Rebecca</font>

176
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was some fight.</font>

177
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're a lot stronger than I expected.</font>

178
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is it good?</font>

179
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yup. The colosseum-lunch is delicious!</font>

180
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not hungry?</font>

181
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mother, I'm hungry.</i></font>

182
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No, I... I don't get hungry.</font>

183
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Really? You're like a samurai.</font>

184
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Got you! Rebecca, this is your chance to kill him!</font>

185
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

186
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Isn't that why you brought him down here?!</font>

187
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what's going on here, Rebecca?!</font>

188
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry up!</font>

189
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hey! You'll spill the food!</font>

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kill him!</font>

191
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's wrong?</font>

192
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You have to kill him,
or you'll never accomplish your goal!</font>

193
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Goal?</font>

194
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca was pinned!</font>

195
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe he moves faster than she does!</font>

196
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do whatever you want.</font>

197
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I deserve it.</font>

198
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't do anything
to the person who bought me lunch.</font>

199
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I tried to kill you!</font>

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter.  I'm not dead. </font>

201
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Besides, you weren't really trying to kill me. </font>

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ow... </font>

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How could he forgive you so easily?</font>

204
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That really shows the difference in power
between you two, Rebecca.</font>

205
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If we'd been able to take out one of the big shots here,
at least we would've had a little hope.</font>

206
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A mummy?!</font>

207
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're not mummies!</font>

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're the prisoner gladiators.</font>

209
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca is one of us too.</font>

210
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have to keep fighting in the arena
until we're killed for the amusement of the audience.</font>

211
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">All because we showed some slight resistance toward the Doflamingo Family. </font>

212
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The king says we can earn our freedom by winning a thousand matches...</font>

213
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but even the most talented fighter would lose if
he was forced to fight to the death a thousand times.</font>

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And anyone who tries to escape is shot to death.</font>

215
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's no way out for us.</font>

216
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:56,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ten years ago, before Doflamingo became king,
colosseum battles weren't fought to the death.</font>

217
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But under his rule, the country has become sharply divided between light and shadow.</font>

218
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

219
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">will win the tournament today, whatever it takes... </font>

220
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and use the Flame Fruit's power
to kill Doflamingo!</font>

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today, Soldier-san's army
is going to challenge Doflamingo... </font>

222
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">in order to free us.</font>

223
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He intends to sacrifice his own life...</font>

224
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to bring down this kingdom!</font>

225
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>It's alright!</i></font>

226
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Soldier-san is brave...</i></font>

227
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>and he will always watch over you!</i></font>

228
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will do it before he can!</font>

229
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm tired of always being protected!</font>

230
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This time, I'm going to protect him!</font>

231
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san's gonna die.</font>

232
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier?</font>

233
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The toy soldier with one leg.</font>

234
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A toy?</font>

235
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Oh, pardon me old man.</i></font>

236
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I met a guy like that at the entrance to the colosseum.</font>

237
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah, that's probably him.</font>

238
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't leave this colosseum.</font>

239
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if something's going on outside, there's nothing we can do.</font>

240
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you're worried about a toy dying?</font>

241
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think it's stranger that a toy's alive to begin with.</font>

242
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you're an outsider,
you probably wouldn't understand.</font>

243
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're no different from humans like us.</font>

244
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They befriend people who are lonely.</font>

245
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look after people with no siblings.</font>

246
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And become lovers for the loveless.</font>

247
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're so close, I don't understand why we can't live together.</font>

248
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:34,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ever since I lost my mother, the last family I had,
Soldier-san's has been there to raise me.</font>

249
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's like a father to me.</font>

250
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hmm, so that toy... </font>

251
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry to keep you all waiting!</font>

252
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The broken ring has been replaced!</font>

253
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your match is about to start, Rebecca.</font>

254
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, what are you doing, Lucy?!</font>

255
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">During that scuffle earlier, some food fell on the floor.</font>

256
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Sorry. You spent all the money you had on these,
so I don't want it to go to waste.</font>

257
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're still good though, even though they've been on the ground!</font>

258
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You don't look like a prisoner to me.</font>

259
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's meet in the finals.</font>

260
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The match is about to start!</font>

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Block D participants, to the ring!</font>

262
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mother!</i></font>

263
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother, look at all the flowers I picked. </font>

264
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, Rebecca!</font>

265
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you like one?</font>

266
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you, I think I'll take one.</font>

267
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is from mother to you.</font>

268
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let us go.</font>

269
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yeah.</font>

270
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Riku Royal Army has set the village on fire!</font>

271
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please stop!</font>

272
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What has gotten into the king?!</font>

273
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The royal palace... it's burning.</font>

274
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening to this country?</font>

275
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please keep running, Scarlett-sama!</font>

276
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who's this midget!? Out of the way!</font>

277
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Keep running!  Get as far as you can!</font>

278
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother, I'm hungry.</font>

279
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I know. We haven't had anything to eat for two days.</font>

280
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca,
can you manage on your own for a little while?</font>

281
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Promise you won't leave this place.</font>

282
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll go get us something to eat.</font>

283
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay!</font>

284
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother?</font>

285
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I couldn't protect her.</font>

286
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, I couldn't protect your mother.</font>

287
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She wanted me to give you this.</font>

288
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She said...
that you were waiting with an empty stomach.</font>

289
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Mother, I'm hungry. </i></font>

290
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>I'll go get us something to eat. </i></font>

291
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There were blood stains on the staircase.</font>

292
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must be around here somewhere.</font>

293
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Find them!</font>

294
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!</font>

295
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your mother was a very important person.</font>

296
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you know that a new king has taken the throne in this land?</font>

297
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's trying to catch all the important people from before.</font>

298
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since you're the daughter of your important mother,
they're trying to catch you as well.</font>

299
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I couldn't protect your mother, but I'll protect you with my life.</font>

300
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:21,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until the day you can find true happiness, I'll always be by your side.</font>

301
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want my mother.</font>

302
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You couldn't protect my mother. I hate you!</font>

303
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about this?  How about this?</font>

304
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How about this?</font>

305
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where are you going, Rebecca?!</font>

306
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going home!</font>

307
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You can't.</font>

308
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The new king has agents waiting for you
in town and at your house.</font>

309
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo-sama!</font>

310
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Doflamingo, Doflamingo!</font>

311
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For hundreds of years, the Riku royal family has brought suffering upon this poor country! </font>

312
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And finally, they've tried to steal what little money their subjects had, just to satisfy their own greed! </font>

313
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm going to bring wealth to this country!</font>

314
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So toys can work too?</font>

315
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I need the money.</font>

316
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca!</font>

317
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boo!</font>

318
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You idiot!</font>

319
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look at how sturdy I am.</font>

320
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm a sturdy and strong super toy!</font>

321
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san is brave...</font>

322
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he will always watch over you.</font>

323
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It must be cold.</font>

324
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Though I can't feel anything with this tin body of mine. </font>

325
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it feel warm?</font>

326
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, it feels very warm.</font>

327
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san is valiant...</font>

328
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and he will always watch over you.</font>

329
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How much is the rent for this house?</font>

330
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's abandoned, so you can just use it.</font>

331
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This area was ransacked by the Riku Royal Army.</font>

332
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So most of the residents have left.</font>

333
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This house is warm.</font>

334
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You should close the window.</font>

335
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No.</font>

336
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are toys here as well.</font>

337
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Children as well. Go and play with them.</font>

338
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since people are watching us in this village,
I'll have to abide by the laws for toys.</font>

339
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I'll have to go to the Toys' House when you go to sleep, but I'll definitely be back before you wake up.</font>

340
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As proof that I'm always by your side,</font>

341
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll drop a single flower petal
through the gap in the window every morning.</font>

342
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good morning, Soldier-san.</font>

343
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, good morning.</font>

344
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She must be an orphan.</font>

345
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So the family won't be a problem.</font>

346
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca!</font>

347
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's pretty cute,
so we'll probably get a good price for her.</font>

348
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca!</font>

349
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn you, how dare a toy go against humans!</font>

350
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll break you! </font>

351
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Soldier-san!</font>

352
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Rebecca!</font>

353
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Forgive me. I've become a wanted man.</font>

354
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then we're the same.</font>

355
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's look for another house.</font>

356
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to live in the same house as you, one day.</font>

357
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna teach you how to fight.</font>

358
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's okay, I've got you to protect me.</font>

359
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what do you plan to do
if something happens to me?</font>

360
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Mother said that it's bad to hurt people.</font>

361
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm teaching you this so that <i>you</i> </font>don't get hurt.

362
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now come at me.</font>

363
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You were always by my side.</font>

364
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You protected me time and time again.</font>

365
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here she comes!</font>

366
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you ready, everyone?!</font>

367
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our colosseum's very own beautiful female gladiator.</font>

368
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The phantom princess!</font>

369
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No one gets the audience worked up like she does.</font>

370
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please don't die, Soldier-san.</font>

371
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I...</font>

372
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Screw you, Rebecca!</font>

373
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today's the day you die!</font>

374
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The entire Riku family can burn in hell!</font>

375
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your family is scum!</font>

376
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">won't lose!</font>

377
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does everyone hate her?</font>

378
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's a good person!</font>

379
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Screw them, she bought me lunch-</font>

380
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We know!</font>

381
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But Rebecca's grandfather
is hated by the entire country.</font>

382
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's the previous King.</font>
