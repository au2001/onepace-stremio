90
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">but staying anchored here for so long is bound to attract attention visually.</font>

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's not, easy but the agreement between the Kuja and the government</font>

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">forbids us from getting any closer than three kilometers from your island.</font>

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Consequently we're forced to wait in the middle of the monsters' den.</font>

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have you heard?</font>

95
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They say the Kuja are specters that turn people to stone!</font>

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get real!</font>

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you kill that Sea King?</font>

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,800

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have not come to hunt Sea Kings.</font>

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I would like to finish my business here and leave these waters quickly.</font>

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,850

119
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,420

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">M-My deepest apologies!</font>

134
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm the one responsible!</font>

135
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be more careful.</font>

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes!</font>

137
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Stop that!</font>

138
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you've come out, Boa Hancock!</font>

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down men!</font>

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the Pirate Empress?!</font>

141
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's the definition of the most beautiful woman in the world!</font>

142
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,430
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Amazon Lily Empress

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}So you've finally come for me...</font>

144
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What meddlesome people.</font>

145
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,110

<font face="Impress BT" size="55">{\an8}I will not go to war!</font>

149
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want you to let me keep my title of Warlord of the Sea.</font>

151
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And...</font>

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I also want all of the cargo on your ship.</font>

153
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What nonsense is this?!</font>

154
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're not a selfish little child!</font>

155
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you honestly think we'll accept such outrageous demands?!</font>

156
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry and haul it over!</font>

157
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a beautiful woman!</font>

158
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll give her anything!</font>

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why are you hauling our cargo?!</font>

160
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come to your senses!</font>

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh no! I blindly listened to what she said!</font>

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Portgas D. Ace's public execution is in exactly one week from today!</font>

163
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fire Fist Ace's life will be ended in the town square of Marineford, at the Navy Headquarters!</font>

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words Whitebeard will make a move within the next week.</font>

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Navy Headquarters, led by three admirals</font>

166
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is prepared to counter Whitebeard with full military force!</font>

167
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Will you lose the title of Warlord or accept the orders to assemble?!</font>

168
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Decide now!</font>

169
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Time is nearly up!</font>

170
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I like the title of Warlord.</font>

171
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want it taken away.</font>

172
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But I hate the World Government.</font>

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't want to obey its orders.</font>

174
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How does this sound?</font>

175
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The marines who came to get me...</font>

176
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Had a mysterious accident on the sea</font>

177
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and were wiped out when they all turned to stone?</font>

178
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's planning to do something!</font>

179
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't let your guard down!</font>

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard about this before!</font>

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A ship was attacked by the Kuja pirate ship...</font>

182
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And when it was discovered later only strange statues were found onboard!</font>

183
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Strange statues?!</font>

184
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I already told you!</font>

185
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your childish selfishness will not be allowed!</font>

186
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Big Sis has a terrible personality.</font>

187
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But she gets everything she wants.</font>

188
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There is a reason for that.</font>

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do you know why that is?</font>

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because no matter what I do...</font>

192
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I kick a kitten...</font>

193
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even if I pull your ears off...</font>

194
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Or even if I kill someone, everyone in the world would forgive me.</font>

195
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason for that is...</font>

196
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes...</font>

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I'm beautiful!</font>

198
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Because I'm beautiful...!</font>

199
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Because I'm beautiful...!</font>

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll let you do anything!</font>

202
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">After all you're beautiful!</font>

203
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop that all of you!</font>

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For being charmed by me your guilty consciences...</font>

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...will turn your bodies solid!</font>

206
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Love Mellow! {No idea what to translate her attacks as, thoughts? Original was "Love-Love Beam"}</font>

207
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hanco--!</font>

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd expect no less from a navy vice-admiral...</font>

209
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

210
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You used pain to block out the evil thoughts.</font>

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You've much experience indeed.</font>

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However...</font>

213
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't say the same about your men.</font>

214
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Fools...!</font>

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It looks like you're the only one left now.</font>

216
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One and zero are not the same!</font>

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We will now return to the peaceful Amazon Lily!</font>

218
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes Snake Princess!</font>

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Boa Hancock!</font>

220
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will wait here as long as I can!</font>

221
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not return empty-handed!</font>

222
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you do not reappear in two days' time...</font>

223
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The agreement is off!</font>

224
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do as you wish.</font>

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the gate!</font>

226
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess has returned!</font>

227
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back!</font>

228
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back Kuja Pirates!</font>

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

230
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ran-sama!</font>

231
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Daisy-sama!</font>

232
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We had a big haul!</font>

233
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're so cool!</font>

234
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna join the pirates someday too!</font>

235
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's the Gorgon Sisters!</font>

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess! Snake Princess!</font>

237
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back.</font>

238
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Monkey Carriage is ready.</font>

239
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Has anything happened?</font>

240
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No. Nothing at all...</font>

241
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Iron ore gunpowder alcohol and crops from the north...</font>

242
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a tremendous haul!</font>

243
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We plundered two merchant ships and one pirate ship.</font>

244
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The center sea people just offshore also gave us their cargo.</font>

245
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Kuja Pirates truly are elite!</font>

246
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ran. Any books at all?</font>

247
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon!</font>

248
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let me think.</font>

249
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh! Those center sea people did give us a newspaper.</font>

250
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Here you are!</font>

251
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,140
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Amazon Lily


















Kuja Castle</font>

252
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back!</font>

253
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Welcome back Snake Princess.</font>

254
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you for holding down the fort.</font>

255
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Enishida. What is this?</font>

256
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh!</font>

257
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a clay model that children from the village worked hard to make for you!</font>

258
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They must have worked hard to paint it too.</font>

259
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The way they carefully carried it to the castle to prevent it from breaking was truly tender and innocent!</font>

260
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh I see.</font>

261
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So they made me...</font>

262
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...Out of mud and clay...</font>

263
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't bring such filthy things into the castle!</font>

265
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw it away at once and clean the floor.</font>

266
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway Enishida...</font>

267
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes?</font>

268
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't see any of our defense warriors there to greet us on our arrival...</font>

269
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, well actually...</font>

270
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A rather violent monkey appeared in the jungle and...</font>

271
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It was such a savage and crude beast that they all had to go after it...</font>

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A monkey?</font>

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't worry. They'll be back shortly.</font>

274
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm truly sorry they weren't there to greet you.</font>

275
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well no matter.</font>

276
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Would you like something to drink?</font>

277
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">White sake.</font>

278
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I think I'll have some too.</font>

279
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon.</font>

280
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is my room. Why are you here?</font>

281
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">G-Granny Nyon!</font>

282
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did you get in?!</font>

283
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can get in any way I want.</font>

284
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw her out.</font>

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait Snake Princess!</font>

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You forgot "please"...</font>

287
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Please."</font>

288
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Pardon me. Please wait Snake Princess.</font>

289
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The center sea people's ship is anchored off shore.</font>

290
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've come here to get you have they not?</font>

291
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They've ordered you into active duty have they not?</font>

292
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right. An invitation to war.</font>

293
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why aren't you going?! You must go!</font>

294
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you go the agreement will be upheld!</font>

295
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Certainly someone with your abilities...</font>

296
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...won't meet an untimely fate!</font>

297
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But...</font>

298
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm scared!</font>

299
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She's almost like a puppy!</font>

300
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait this is no time for that!</font>

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon...</font>

302
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This land is currently protected by your title of Warlord of the Sea!</font>

303
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Up until recently this island was protected from outside enemies</font>

304
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">by the great defense network that is the Calm Belt!</font>

305
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However now the center sea people are using new ship-crafting techniques</font>

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to come and go through these waters as they please.</font>

307
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that you're a Warlord of the Sea is the only reason they won't set foot on this island</font>

308
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">to put a stop to the Kuja's pirate ways.</font>

309
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The island is also home to the very young and the very old.</font>

310
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you lose the title and we return to being a regular pirate nation</font>

311
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">only tragedy will await us!</font>

312
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Are you sure you're not just afraid?</font>

313
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My life could end at any time now.</font>

314
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Look closely at this crystal ball!</font>

315
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let us shed light on your future...</font>

316
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}"Go!"</i></font>

317
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Detestable!</font>

318
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw her out!</font>

319
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This instant!</font>

320
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Y-Yes! Right away!</font>

321
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait! Snake Princess!</font>

322
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! What are you doing?!</font>

323
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I watched quietly
only for you to put on a pathetic act.</font>

324
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are you trying to pull here?</font>

325
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your era came to an end a long time ago...</font>

326
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You lost your place as Amazon Lily's empress three decades ago,</font>

327
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gloriosa!</font>

328
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If my own selfishness should bring about the end of our kingdom, I would be forgiven for it...</font>

329
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The reason for that is</font>

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">yes...</font>

331
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...because I'm beautiful!</font>

332
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There it is!</font>

333
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess's "Extreme Looking-Down Pose!"</font>

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You may have been the empress of this kingdom once,</font>

335
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and yet you abandoned the kingdom and set off to sea!</font>

336
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You Kuja traitor!</font>

337
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why I live quietly on
the edge of the village now!</font>

338
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then you should continue
to live there quietly.</font>

339
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I will not have you interfering with me
the current empress!</font>

340
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Snake Princess!</font>

341
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Let go!</font>

342
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That said I can't help but admire your zeal.</font>

343
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You win.</font>

344
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You agree to what I said Snake Princess?</font>

345
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It really does pay to talk things through!</font>

346
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank you!</font>

347
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll go then?!</font>

348
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I lied. Don't get cocky!</font>

349
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get out of my sight!</font>

350
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Curse you Snake Princess!</font>

351
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">S-Snake Princess...</font>

352
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What have you done?! She's an old woman!</font>

353
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know what came over me...</font>

354
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes! Yes! That sort of thing
happens to all of us!</font>

355
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Granny Nyon!</font>

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Aged as I may be I am still a Kuja warrior.</font>

357
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have not grown decrepit!</font>

358
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess is about to bathe!</font>

359
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Leave the castle premises immediately!</font>

360
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Come on! Let's hurry!</font>

361
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I-I just started eating!</font>

362
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry outside!</font>

363
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for their bath!</font>

364
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get ready!</font>

365
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people in the castle are coming
so it's about to get packed in here!</font>

366
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>{\an8}Bath</i></font>

367
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">For the next several hours</font>

368
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">entrance into the castle
is strictly forbidden!</font>

369
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Say...</font>

370
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why does everyone make such a big deal when the Snake Princess takes a bath?</font>

371
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How old are you now?</font>

372
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Eight.</font>

373
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then I'll tell you.</font>

374
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gorgon Sisters' secret?!</font>

375
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

376
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gorgon was the name of a monster
that once lived in the center ocean.</font>

377
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone who looked at this terrifying
monster would instantly turn to stone.</font>

378
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the end of an adventure
the Snake Princess and her sisters</font>

379
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">managed to slay the Gorgon monster.</font>

380
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But when the monster uttered its death howls</font>

381
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">it placed a horrible curse
on the three warriors.</font>

382
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The monster's large eyes
were etched onto their backs</font>

383
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and everyone nearby who's lured in
by their charm and looks at them</font>

384
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">is turned to stone and killed.</font>

385
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Gorgon Sisters never remove
their clothes in front of people.</font>

386
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And when they bathe</font>

387
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">they always post guards
like this to keep people away.</font>

388
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,030
<font face="impress bt" size="45">Island of Women, Jungle</font>

389
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did he run to?!</font>

390
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He went up the craggy mountain!</font>

391
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't tell me he went back into the village?!</font>

392
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He wanted a ship!</font>

393
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

394
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, what now?</font>

395
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll get spotted again if I just sit here...</font>

396
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She did mention this island
has a pirate ship...</font>

397
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I can just borrow it somehow...</font>

398
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No wait. Nami's not here.</font>

399
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll end up drifting around
if I go all by myself.</font>

400
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh I know!</font>

401
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Asking for a ride on the
ship is the best way!</font>

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,340
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll ask if they'll take me to
Sabaody Archipelago!</font>

403
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means...</font>

404
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll have to talk to someone important</font>

405
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and since important people
live in tall buildings...</font>

406
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm thinking so hard I might get a fever!</font>

407
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay! I'll just go into
a tall building first!</font>

408
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hurry to the village!</font>

409
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess has
probably already returned!</font>

410
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If she finds the man
things will turn serious!</font>

411
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's brittle!</font>

412
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that?!</font>

413
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The castle tower's roof collapsed!</font>

414
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's happening?!</font>

415
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Snake Princess is taking a bath in there!</font>

416
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">More water?!</font>

417
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ouch it's hot! Wait this is bathwater!</font>

418
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm gonna die! I'm gonna drown!</font>

419
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My feet are on the ground. I'm safe!</font>

420
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this a bath?</font>

421
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A man!?</font>

422
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey...</font>

423
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That thing on your back...</font>

424
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems familiar somehow...</font>

425
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You saw it?!</font>
