<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That's the deal.</i></font>

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>As long as we've got each other by the neck, you won't be tempted to do anything funny.</i></font>

135
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>And I can feel secure, too.</i></font>

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've always believed that you can't trust anyone.</font>

137
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You reap what you sow, as they say.</font>

138
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You must have already found out...</font>

139
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that now, Vergo has your heart.</font>

140
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey!</font>

141
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I suppose that even you couldn't have expected...</font>

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that Monet's smart enough to change her appearance and follow you.</font>

143
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, are you alright, Traf?</font>

144
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">She overheard everything that you guys are planning.</font>

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'm disappointed, Law.</font>

146
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought we'd finally become very good friends.</font>

147
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So you were saved by your exceptional secretary?  I should've paid more attention to her.</font>

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I let myself become sloppy
because you're such a blundering idiot.</font>

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Watch your mouth, brat.</font>

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's amazing.  You're still alive
even though that guy's got your heart?</font>

151
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At the mercy of your own power, Law?</font>

152
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'd like to know what you did with my heart.</font>

153
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Over here! Smo-</font>

154
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master, we're ready to start the broadcast.</font>

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, really?</font>

156
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You escape death, for now.</font>

157
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay, begin.</font>

158
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Something's being projected!</font>

159
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's this?  Where is that?  Is that...</font>

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a candy?  A huge candy!</font>

161
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Little Smileys were scattered from the Blazing Lands...</font>

162
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:25,210
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="45">Various New World Locations - Underworld Brokers</font></font>

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and will soon gather in the middle of the Frozen Lands.</font>

164
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:33,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once they all join together again
and become the complete Smiley,</font>

165
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the experiment will begin.</font>

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:57,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Four years ago, an explosion utterly devastated
this island.  It was a poison gas bomb, called H<font size="28">2<font size="55">S.</font></font></font>

167
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>That</i> is what Smiley is.</font>

168
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But last time there was a problem.</font>

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:19,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">People who inhaled the poison were weakened
but they were able to find safe places to take shelter.</font>

170
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I plan to give the weapon
from four years ago, Smiley, a huge treat.</font>

171
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One that will supplement the poison gas
to become a flawless weapon of mass destruction.</font>

172
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Today marks the birth of a new weapon.</font>

173
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Its name will be...</font>

174
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shinokuni!</font>

175
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="38"><i>Land of Death</i></font>

176
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,900
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="45">Frozen Lands - Central Area</font></font>

177
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's coming!</font>

178
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Can't we get away from it?</font>

179
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It has completely merged together on this side!</font>

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just what is that thing?</font>

181
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No time to worry about it.  Just focus on running.</font>

182
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Excuse me, everyone.
There appears to be a huge ball ahead!</font>

183
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's that?</font>

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's in the shape of a candy?</font>

185
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There are people next to it.</font>

186
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,720
<font face="impress bt" size="45"><font size="45">Vegapunk's Dragon (Miniature)</font></font>

187
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master, I can confirm a giant, gelatinous creature.</font>

188
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We think that it's Smiley.</font>

189
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then, we'll proceed as planned
and project Master's broadcast onto the mist.</font>

190
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Good.</font>

191
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Once you finish the job,
you have to escape or you'll be in grave danger.</font>

192
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Get on the dragon sleigh and hurry-</font>

193
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened?</font>

194
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We...</font>

195
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've got a problem with the sled.  It appears to be melting!</font>

196
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't use it like this!</font>

197
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why'd this happen now?!</font>

198
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Is this some kind of chemical reaction?  It's completely useless now.</font>

199
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The dragon is running away!</font>

200
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">One thing after another!</font>

201
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

202
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a terrible thing to happen!</font>

203
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not very convincing.</font>

204
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Guys, just run!</font>

205
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your protective suits are useless now!</font>

206
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Throw them off and run to the laboratory!</font>

207
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">U-Understood.</font>

208
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take off our suits?</font>

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master's orders are absolute!  He must have some plan!</font>

210
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Do what he tells you!</font>

211
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-Hurry up!</font>

212
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn on, damn you!</font>

213
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?  Now someone's image is being projected into the air!</font>

214
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ignore it.  Just ignore it.  Anyway, just run!</font>

215
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smiley!  I missed you!</font>

216
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's been three long years!</font>

217
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, yes, Smiley!</font>

218
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This brings back so many memories! 
I've prepared a very, very tasty treat for you!</font>

219
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay!  Stay now, Smiley!</font>

220
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just a little bit longer!</font>

221
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your Master's orders are absolute!</font>

222
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's how I trained you.</font>

223
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stay!  I told you to stay!</font>

224
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I have so much I want to talk to you about!
Do you remember?</font>

225
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It all started, yes, four years ago...</font>

226
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A-Alright!</font>

227
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Alright then!  You can eat now!  Good boy!</font>

228
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He isn't listening to you.</font>

229
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ate it.</font>

230
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He ate it!  He ate the treat!</font>

231
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You ate it, didn't you, Smiley?</font>

232
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Be reborn.</font>

233
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it'll become something even more terrifying?</font>

234
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A perfect weapon of mass destruction.</font>

235
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's one big frog!</font>

236
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's starting.  Something's starting to happen!</font>

237
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But what exactly will happen?</font>

238
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hell if I know!  But it ain't gonna be good!</font>

239
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Whatever, we just gotta run to the lab,
like Master said.</font>

240
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  Why did the sled have to break now?!</font>

241
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

242
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's acting weird since he ate that candy.</font>

243
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Was the candy really so delicious?</font>

244
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We must make haste!</font>

245
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even those who defend this island are running for their lives.</font>

246
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It does not bode well for things to come.</font>

247
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I agree.</font>

248
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well done, Smiley.</font>

249
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Farewell.</font>

250
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Greetings to the newborn...</font>

251
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The weapon of mass destruction, Shinokuni!</font>

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Change the landscape of this island forever!</font>

253
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Wait for m-</font>

254
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My legs!</font>

255
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What's going on?</font>

256
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me...</font>

257
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What happened to him?!</font>

258
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Does it matter?!  Just run!</font>

259
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My body...</font>

260
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">won't... mo...</font>

261
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run!  Just run!</font>

262
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

263
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!  It was a success!</font>

264
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Not a single soul can escape!</font>

265
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is perfect.</font>

266
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The problem with the previous experiment was that there were survivors.</font>

267
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The poison worked but they could still move a bit
so they managed to escape.</font>

268
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But!</font>

269
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It would've worked much better
if I had been able to freeze them!</font>

270
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This gas coats the body like ash.</font>

271
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is absorbed through the skin and paralyzes the entire body.</font>

272
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,090
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, my perfect weapon of
mass destruction, Shinokuni!</font>

273
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Show me more!  Show me the ultimate hellscape!</font>

274
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

275
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The people are...</font>

276
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Save me!</font>

277
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">...freezing solid!</font>

278
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey... what is this?</font>

279
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this terrifying video?</font>

280
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The ones who died looked like Caesar's subordinates.</font>

281
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What the hell is that purple smoke?</font>

282
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, what country are they showing?</font>

283
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you better not look behind you.</font>

284
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way!  It was happening on <i>this</i> island?!</font>

285
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55"><i>Master!</i></font>

286
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Crap!  If we don't run, we'll end up like them!</font>

287
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It doesn't matter!
There isn't anywhere on this island we can run to!</font>

288
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, I see!  That's why they sealed the laboratory!</font>

289
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To keep the gas out!</font>

290
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open up!  Caesar!  Dammit!</font>

291
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I ain't gonna die out here like that!</font>

292
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  Dammit!  Quit messing around!</font>

293
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open up!</font>

294
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run away!</font>

295
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Things don't look good!</font>

296
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You guys run as fast as you can!</font>

297
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you get caught, I'm leaving you behind!</font>

298
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Zoro-san!  At this rate, we're all going to...</font>

299
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Unidentified object spotted at 12 o'clock!</font>

300
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is that?!</font>

301
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a...</font>

302
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">dragon!</font>

303
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dragon?!</font>

304
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A dragon?!</font>

305
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't be stupid!  Dragons aren't real!</font>

306
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They have them on this island!</font>

307
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But this one is a lot smaller than the first one.</font>

308
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey.  Maybe we can capture it and fly away!</font>

309
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a splendid idea!</font>

310
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's decided!  We can't keep this up forever!</font>

311
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're gonna capture him!</font>

312
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hold it right there, Dragon!</font>

313
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's my crew!  They're being chased by the smoke!</font>

314
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dragon!</font>

315
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What are they doing out there?</font>

316
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And what kind of running do they call that?</font>

317
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems the samurai's body is complete again.</font>

318
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you're right.</font>

319
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So I guess he won't be giving me his legs again.</font>

320
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey Robin!  This isn't the time for that!</font>

321
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, you guys!  That smoke's bad stuff!</font>

322
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Run awa...</font>

323
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's impossible.  If I try to yell...</font>

324
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn Sea Stone.</font>

325
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Oh, are they your friends, Straw Hat Luffy?</font>

326
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I'd expect from the great
Straw Hat Pirates, they're quite tough.</font>

327
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But they're just seconds away from
being killed by the gas.</font>

328
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And it'll continue to spread...</font>

329
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">until nothing can live on this island.  A land of death!</font>

330
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nobody outside of this laboratory will be able to survive.</font>

331
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course...</font>

332
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that will include you, too!</font>

333
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

334
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, let's show the world...</font>

335
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">that against my weapon of
mass destruction, Shinokuni...</font>

336
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a 400 million bounty,</font>

337
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">a Navy Vice-Admiral,</font>

338
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">and even one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,</font>

339
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">are all helpless to save themselves from dying!</font>

340
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?  What should I do?</font>

341
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He's doing something with Luffy and the others!</font>

342
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?</font>

343
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I want to save them, but with this injured body I'd just get captured.</font>

344
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:28,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If that happens, then all my efforts to investigate the drug and get the sedatives, will be wasted.</font>

345
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What should I do?  What should I do?</font>

346
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was dangerous. I was almost spotted.</font>

347
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm?  Paper?</font>

348
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">"Don't do anything"?</font>

349
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who threw this?</font>

350
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could it be?</font>

351
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smokey!</font>

352
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Tashigi-chan!</font>

353
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Thank goodness you're okay!</font>

354
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No... They're still captive!</font>

355
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit!  We're all gonna get killed after all!</font>

356
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Smokey!  Tashigi-chan!</font>

357
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Our men?</font>

358
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,990
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But more importantly,</font>

359
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That really is a well-equipped laboratory.</font>

360
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

361
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I bet a facility like that would have
the means to transport large machinery.</font>

362
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,150
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why would you discuss
such things at a time like this?!</font>

363
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hm, alright!  At any rate, we're stuck.</font>

364
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I hadn't anticipated Vergo's arrival, but nonetheless...</font>

365
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw-hatter.</font>

366
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We don't have time to dawdle about in here.</font>

367
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The plan hasn't changed.</font>

368
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make sure you don't mess up from here on out.</font>

369
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's time for our counterattack.</font>
