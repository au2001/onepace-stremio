63
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It melted!</font>

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Straw Hat and the others were abducted.</font>

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,750
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems you know quite a lot about this island.</font>

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, I'm not quite sure how to put this.</font>

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The fact that they've been captured means there is a strong possibility it may already be too late.</font>

69
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

70
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Too late?!</font>

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">P-Please don't get mad at me.</font>

72
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's keep a straight face!</font>

73
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even though as a skeleton, I don't have a face!</font>

74
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skull joke!</font>

75
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, he's already dead.</font>

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway,</font>

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking and listen to me.</font>

78
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop it, he's already dead.</font>

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It is as I told you on the ship, when my ship's rudder failed,</font>

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I began wandering the sea alone decades ago...</font>

81
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:01,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought of escaping this evil sea, but with the rudder broken I was just a puppet of the sea current.</font>

82
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was more than five years ago.</font>

83
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And just like you now, I eventually was lead to Thriller Bark.</font>

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wanted to leave the Florian Triangle no matter what.</font>

85
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hoping that there might be parts to fix the rudder on the island, I investigated.</font>

86
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When I entered, I found nothing but zombies and monsters in the way.</font>

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before long I was captured and brought to this building.</font>

88
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:45,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Inside I saw a combat dancer who was caught earlier and a patched corpse which they called a marionette.</font>

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Afterwards, a terrifying and huge man appeared, and...!</font>

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He tore the man's shadow from the floor!</font>

91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He cut it off!</font>

92
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His shadow was cut off?</font>

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I thought my eyes were deceiving me... even though...</font>

94
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't have any eyes.</font>

95
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop joking or I'll kick your ass!</font>

96
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't mind if you do.</font>

97
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I was to have the same fate before long.</font>

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The one whose shadow was taken collapsed where he stood.</font>

99
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">On the other hand, his severed shadow was pressed inside the unmoving body of the marionette.</font>

100
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I didn't think that was possible...</font>

101
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,620
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How he did it, I'm unsure...</font>

102
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But, the marionette corpse just...</font>

103
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Started moving on its own!</font>

104
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you mean?</font>

105
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A shadow is another soul that goes and moves along with you anywhere.</font>

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It follows you from birth to death.</font>

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's a soul that will never leave you, that will always obey and follow you.</font>

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man that seizes these, and has them obey his will is...</font>

109
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Royal Warlord of the Sea, Gekko Moriah!</font>

110
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The user of the Shadow Fruit.</font>

111
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">A devil fruit, huh?</font>

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As long as there's a corpse, he can use a shadow to bring forth a zombie.</font>

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:24,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The problem is that the genius surgeon who creates these tough creatures, Doctor Hogback... has friends.</font>

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In some cases, he gets parts from different graveyards...</font>

115
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Using the corpses of legendary warriors to revive them.</font>

116
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:39,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Moreover, he has an immense amount of enumerated marionettes still stored in a freezer in his lab.</font>

117
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dr. Hogback...</font>

118
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:48,800
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that famous doctor came to this place after the incident of his disappearance to help a pirate.</font>

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, the zombies' bodies can move, so it's not like they've been resurrected.</font>

120
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Correct.</font>

121
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The shadow holds both the personality and fighting skills of its owner.</font>

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The physical strength of the marionette is limited by the power of it's body.</font>

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When both strong shadow and body are merged, the result is an even more powerful zombie.</font>

124
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That is why Moriah so eagerly desires the shadows of bounty heads.</font>

125
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

126
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They were after us from the start.</font>

127
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's the whole story of Thriller Bark.</font>

128
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To Moriah, the zombie's most important characteristic might be obedience.</font>

129
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The stronger the warrior the harder it must be to make it listen.</font>

130
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">True... they receive the same fighting spirit and skill as their owner.</font>

131
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The strong ones are set adrift at sea after they lose consciousness.</font>

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, they...!</font>

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is bad.</font>

134
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're safe yet.</font>

135
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We have time.</font>

136
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right now I will tell you the best plan we have.</font>

137
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So please, trust me and do as I say.</font>

138
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Trust you?!</font>

139
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Skull Shock!</font>

140
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I haven't had a conversation like this in decades! It's so fun!</font>

141
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,980
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We're listening, so tell us quickly.</font>

142
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Okay...</font>

143
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

144
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Three Mysterious Persons have arrived!</font>

145
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That was quick. Enter.</font>

146
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please, come inside.</font>

147
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You finally came.</font>

148
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Make me the Pirate King.</font>

149
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Very soon.</font>

150
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're no Pirate King!</font>

151
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate King will be...</font>

152
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Me!</font>

153
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Untie this string you giant leek!</font>

154
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Usopp, Nami, Chopper, Sanji, Zoro... Give them all back!</font>

155
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did you take them, leek?!</font>

156
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a splendidly strong man.</font>

157
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,890
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So this is Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

158
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.</font>

159
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You mentioned many names.</font>

160
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We've only captured three of you so far.</font>

161
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:16,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Pirate Hunter Zoro and a blond guy with no wanted poster.</font>

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Could that blond guy be Sanji...?</font>

163
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What?!</font>

164
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, it seems Zoro and Sanji also got caught.</font>

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No way, and Luffy was also caught!</font>

166
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">H-How come that monstrous trio got caught so easily?!</font>

167
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I don't know who these guys are, but they're definitely bad news!</font>

168
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">By the way, what happened with those three, Perona?</font>

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Risky Brothers were supposed to deliver them...</font>

170
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They didn't bring them to Kumashi.</font>

171
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Didn't they escape while they were being delivered?</font>

172
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They're talking about us.</font>

173
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't say it. You... Don't say it!</font>

174
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I told you not to open your mouth!</font>

175
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too strict with Kumashi...</font>

176
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Way too strict.</font>

177
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyways, I was trying to get a hold of my bride when those three...</font>

178
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ran into your garden and caused a disturbance.</font>

179
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey, wait a second.</font>

180
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That means... Hogback...!</font>

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bastard, do you mean that one of you laid a hand on my bride?!</font>

182
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that's what happened before!</font>

183
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Your bride is not coming.</font>

184
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that, Cindry!?</font>

185
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Hey! Hey! Cindry-chan, you're making it worse!</font>

186
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And why did you step out in front of me?</font>

187
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yours won't be coming either.</font>

188
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a low blow! Where did that come from?!</font>

189
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop! Stop!</font>

190
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,930
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Stop this pointless discussion.</font>

191
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If some pirates got away, then you guys can do something about it later.</font>

192
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:01,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I gathered you here to celebrate the creation of a great fighting asset.</font>

193
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Who is that guy!?</font>

194
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,390
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master, that pirate bit the cage apart to escape!</font>

195
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He...!</font>

196
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bit the cage!</font>

197
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you gonna do to catch me now?!</font>

198
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What a promising man!</font>

199
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait, Absalom, we're inside a room.</font>

200
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll stop him.</font>

201
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like you'd catch me, idiot!</font>

202
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Negative Hollow!</font>

203
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I were to be reborn, I want to become a sea slug...</font>

204
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The man who just said he wanted to be Pirate King now wants to be a sea slug...</font>

205
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Atrocious...</font>

206
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,790
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Turn the light on!</font>

207
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What're you doing, damn it!</font>

208
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You'll regret this!</font>

209
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,220
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">W-What's that?!</font>

210
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My shadow...!</font>

211
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I finally have it!</font>

212
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The 300 million fighting power!</font>

213
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,600
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With this, the Ultimate Special Zombie can be created!</font>

214
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,590
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Go back to the ship?</font>

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To the Sunny?</font>

216
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Correct.</font>

217
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:53,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The worst case scenario is that your friends have been captured and their shadows have been stolen.</font>

218
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, having their shadow stolen isn't going to kill them.</font>

219
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take a look at what happened to me!</font>

220
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Ah, I died!</font>

221
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's a different story!</font>

222
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyway...</font>

223
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In short, even if they got their shadow stolen, they won't die.</font>

224
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's right.</font>

225
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,560
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">However, the moment their shadows are taken, they become vulnerable as they lose consciousness.</font>

226
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And won't wake up for two days.</font>

227
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">During this time they put those who are strong into boats and cast them off from Thriller Bark.</font>

228
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've said this before but, do you know why they do that?</font>

229
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that the victims won't attempt to return to the island and reclaim their shadows, right?</font>

230
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Precisely.</font>

231
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, why not just kill them while they're unconscious?</font>

232
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They cannot.</font>

233
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is very important, so listen carefully.</font>

234
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">First of all...</font>

235
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Although the body and the shadow may be separated, they're part of one being.</font>

236
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,680
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If the body dies, then the shadow is doomed as well.</font>

237
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In other words, the moment that happens, the zombie will also perish.</font>

238
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This means trouble for the enemy, so they make sure to keep the body alive.</font>

239
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,710
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Which means that, even if your friends have been stripped off their shadows...</font>

240
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">They are surely alive and are being taken back to the ship.</font>

241
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why...!</font>

242
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If you two become victims as well, this will turn into the worst case scenario!</font>

243
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Everyone would've lost their shadows and will be left to wander the sea.</font>

244
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But something can still be done. If we wake up your friends...</font>

245
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,420
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll have one chance to figure out how to recover the stolen shadows.</font>

246
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Did you get all that?</font>

247
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

248
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,840
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That makes sense.</font>

249
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Take this, you two.</font>

250
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,160
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

251
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies' weakness.</font>

252
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's effectiveness against the Spider Monkey is proof!</font>

253
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Weakness?</font>

254
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,820
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is this?</font>

255
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,810
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salt.</font>

256
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Salt?</font>

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So it's kinda like we're defeating some evil being by purifying it?</font>

258
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well, you could say that.</font>

259
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombies are originally animated by the power of the devil fruit.</font>

260
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just as the sea nullifies the abilities of a devil fruit user...</font>

261
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:21,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">the salt which has the sea's power undoes the bond between the false soul and the corpse.</font>

262
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,510
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I see.</font>

263
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">So that thing that flew out of the monkey's mouth a little while ago was the shadow from within his body.</font>

264
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To think they had such a weakness...</font>

265
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now then, to defeat the Zombies, simply throw the salt into their mouths!</font>

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's the trick!</font>

267
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only trick!</font>

268
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The trick!</font>

269
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The trick, the trick, the trick!</font>

270
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">But Brook...</font>

271
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why is it that you happen to know so much about this island and the zombies?</font>

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">When my shadow was stolen five years ago...</font>

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,950
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Naturally, I was cast off in my ship, but luckily enough I woke up in time to find a way back.</font>

274
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And then I returned to the island...</font>

275
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To fight...</font>

276
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,920
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The zombie that has my shadow!</font>

277
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,110
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">But... I was completely defeated.</font>

278
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shamefully ran to save my life...</font>

279
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what...</font>

280
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,500
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">No matter what... I didn't want to die.</font>

281
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I was the sole survivor from my ship.</font>

282
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Because I promised my friends that one day I'd escape from this Devil Sea...</font>

283
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I shamefully ran to save my life!</font>

284
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,960
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And though I managed to live a long while, I was unable to achieve any resolution.</font>

285
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,470
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's why... I will not escape this time!</font>

286
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Until I beat that man and recover my shadow I-</font>

287
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Well then...</font>

288
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please excuse me, I'll go ahead.</font>

289
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Have a good day.</font>

290
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Wait a minute!</font>

291
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">While we're still at it, just answer me one more question.</font>

292
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,130
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">L-Luffy!</font>

293
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What was that... just now?</font>

294
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,290
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His shadow...!</font>

295
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His shadow was ripped off!</font>

296
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It's just like the story that skeleton Brook told us.</font>

297
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If his shadow was taken... then that means this guy also took Brook's!</font>

298
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe it...</font>

299
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How come he can do such a thing?</font>

300
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Kumashi! You were blabbering again weren't you?!</font>

301
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,670
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're too strict with Kumashi...</font>

302
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Way too strict.</font>

303
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This guy will bring me one step closer to being the Pirate King, right Hogback?</font>

304
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,270
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Since the day I met you ten years ago, I've served you for the day Number 900 would be made.</font>

305
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,940
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">With that shadow we can create the greatest zombie ever made...</font>

306
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And without a doubt, it'll become a huge source of power for us!</font>

307
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The day that I will be known worldwide as the Graveyard King has come closer!</font>

308
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,400
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">My dream kingdom where all the world's cute things will become zombies and serve me is before my eyes!</font>

309
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,100
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Even the most insolent bastard will become an obedient zombie if I take his shadow!</font>

310
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll turn this world into one full of obedient zombies!</font>

311
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,640
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If I had a servant like this back then...</font>

312
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,040
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I wouldn't have lost to that idiot Kaidou in the New World!</font>

313
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Let's wake him up already!</font>

314
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,230
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Gyoro!</font>

315
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Nin!</font>

316
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,570
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Bao!</font>

317
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes, master!</font>

318
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,380
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Open the door to the special freezer!</font>

319
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,240
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Right away, master!</font>

320
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,350
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just you wait, 900.</font>

321
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Spider Mouse.</font>

322
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dump Straw Hat Luffy's body on his ship.</font>

323
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,410
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And don't forget to remove the thread, it'll be troublesome if he dies.</font>

324
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

325
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,370
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Please wait! I have a report!</font>

326
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,860
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What is it?</font>

327
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,830
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Just now, Commander Spider Monkey Tararan was defeated!</font>

328
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,430
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Defeated?</font>

329
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,260
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That's not possible, unless his shadow is extracted.</font>

330
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,330
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">His shadow was extracted!</font>

331
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Absalom...</font>

332
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,610
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The only man capable of such a thing, is him!</font>

333
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Chivalrous Humming Swordsman!</font>

334
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems the report Hildon gave me wasn't wrong.</font>

335
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This is terrible!</font>

336
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The Humming One has been freeing lots of shadows!</font>

337
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Before I knew it, there were countless victims!</font>

338
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,870
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">At this rate, the nightmare from five years ago will be repeated!</font>

339
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,850
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn... He's the only man who could tell the zombies' weakn-</font>

340
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Huh?</font>

341
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">How did he find out-</font>

342
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,000
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Cindry-chan, why're you standing in front of me?!</font>

343
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,760
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I've heard about him but... what is he like?</font>

344
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,730
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Perona, you don't know what he looks like?</font>

345
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Then, that's why he wasn't spotted.</font>

346
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Master!</font>

347
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,660
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">That troublemaker has come once again...</font>

348
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,120
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Like I care about such a thing, idiot!</font>

349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You take care of it!</font>

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,650
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">H-Hold on!</font>

351
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now, on to the freezer.</font>

352
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,280
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Still, the current situation is...</font>

353
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,030
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot! Say that in the first place!</font>

354
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">In that case, we should be able to contain him.</font>

355
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,170
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes.</font>

356
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">If there's a problem when he wakes up, report it.</font>

357
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Now go ahead and throw Straw Hat out already.</font>

358
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,970
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Yes!</font>

359
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Heave-ho!</font>

360
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,020
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, don't go out!</font>

361
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems being stripped of your shadow won't kill you!</font>

362
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,310
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It didn't kill Brook.</font>

363
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We can't go out yet.</font>

364
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,320
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We'll wait for our chance!</font>

365
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,690
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It seems like they're going to do something with Luffy's shadow.</font>

366
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,490
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">We need to see what happens to it so we can get it back later!</font>

367
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,200
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Those two are no longer here.</font>

368
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,530
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where did they go?</font>

369
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,360
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't believe they got Tararan.</font>

370
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,900
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Where's the enemy?!</font>

371
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,540
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I'll cut them in an instant!</font>

372
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,210
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Franky.</font>

373
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,550
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">What do you want?! I'm not crying!</font>

374
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,060
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Idiot, don't look this way!</font>

375
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Why did you ask him... such a question?</font>

376
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,910
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Shut up! Don't mind me!</font>

377
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Dammit! I love that skeleton now!</font>

378
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,740
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There isn't a guy that good anywhere!</font>

379
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,580
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Damn!</font>

380
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're right.</font>

381
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,250
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">As I thought, you're not gonna give up by merely kicking you out.</font>

382
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Of course!</font>

383
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,050
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Don't you know my name?</font>

384
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,450
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Anyone who hears the name Swordmaster Ryuuma will cower in fear.</font>

385
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,440
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Silence!</font>

386
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You're my shadow!</font>

387
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,180
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">There's a big difference between our bodies.</font>

388
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">You shall return...</font>

389
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,520
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">To my feet!</font>

390
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,190
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">I can't wait!</font>

391
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,700
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">Back when I saw his corpse in the Ice Country, I couldn't help but tremble.</font>

392
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,480
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">It takes my breath away to think this repulsive thing rampaged through the seas 500 years ago!</font>

393
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,080
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">He took the entire island of each country he conquered to expand his own territory...</font>

394
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,770
<font face="Impress BT" size="55" color="#d6d6d6">Cold...!</font>

395
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,630
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">And thus he built the so called Evil Country.</font>

396
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,070
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The very founder of the Country-Puller legend is right there!</font>

397
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,010
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">This will be the best zombie ever create-!</font>

398
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,780
<font face="Impress BT" size="55">The legend will be reborn once again!</font>
